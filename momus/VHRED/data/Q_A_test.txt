BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Liberals push to legalize marijuana, many Canadians are concerned about the consequences of people driving while high. EOS BOS We have seen these issues in Colorado, where marijuana-related traffic deaths increased by 92% between 2010 and 2014. EOS BOS After meetings with drug recognition experts, it is clear there is no precise way to measure impairment while under the influence of marijuana. EOS BOS Will the Liberals stop their drive to legalize marijuana until authorities have the tools to ensure the safety of Canadians on the road? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. gentleman's concern and very keen interest in this dimension of the issue. EOS BOS I can assure him that we are putting the steps in place to make sure the public is properly protected. EOS BOS This includes over the last three or four months testing scientifically a variety of different roadside testing devices in seven different locations across the country to ensure that they function properly under Canadian conditions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when his government was elected last year, the Prime Minister said that the good old Canada was back on the world stage. EOS BOS The good old Canada was committed to protecting human rights in the international arena. EOS BOS That means that Canada must stop selling weapons to those who violate human rights. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister agree to create a parliamentary committee to examine foreign arms sales before approving them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been very clear. EOS BOS We believe that we need to demonstrate more transparency and rigour when it comes to the sale of arms on the international market. EOS BOS That is one reason why we committed to sign the arms trade treaty. EOS BOS We are going to work with all members of the House to ensure that Canada endorses and upholds this treaty. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the Prime Minister claims he believes in human rights, transparency, and accountability. EOS BOS He has an opportunity to prove it. EOS BOS Canadians want more oversight when it comes to selling arms, weapons, and tanks to countries like Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Libya. EOS BOS Will he or will he not support creating a parliamentary committee to bring transparency to any foreign arms sales before they take place? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we agree with the member opposite that Canadians do want greater transparency and accountability in many different areas, but particularly in terms of arms sales. EOS BOS That is why we have committed to demonstrating a higher level of transparency and openness, and why we have agreed to sign on to the arms trade treaty EOS BOS . 
              We will be the last NATO country to sign on to that because the previous government did not want to. EOS BOS We know that it is the right thing to do and, quite frankly, it is what Canadians expect of their government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives keep promising they will not approve an unsafe pipeline like the northern gateway, but yesterday the minister was in New York, promising a room full of oil executives that he would push through an oil pipeline to the west coast. EOS BOS Canadians are used to B.C. Conservatives talking out of both sides of their mouths, delays in New York, and full steam ahead when they are in Ottawa. EOS BOS However, the government has to make a real choice, and make a choice soon, between the narrow interests of oil lobbyists and the interests of British Columbians and the safety of our coastal communities. EOS BOS That choice is clear. EOS BOS Will the government just reject the northern gateway pipeline proposal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the joint review panel report has been submitted to the government. EOS BOS Projects will only be approved if they are safe for Canadians and safe for the environment. EOS BOS We are carefully reviewing this report and a decision will be forthcoming. EOS BOS Speaking of decisions, when will the NDP decide to pay back the $1.17 million it bilked Canadian taxpayers of for its illegal mail-outs? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, delaying a decision will not make this bad project any better. EOS BOS Apparently there are 21 Conservative MPs from British Columbia, but we would not know it from their deafening silence on Enbridge northern gateway. EOS BOS This raw bitumen pipeline is opposed by over 130 first nations, the Union of British Columbia Municipalities and two-thirds of all British Columbians. EOS BOS If my Conservative colleagues do not care about B.C.'s west coast and do not care about B.C.'s economy, maybe they care enough to protect their own political backsides. EOS BOS Will they finally stand up to the oil lobby, stand up to the Prime Minister, and finally stand up for British Columbia and say “no” to Enbridge northern gateway? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is thoroughly reviewing the joint panel report prior to making a decision on this project. EOS BOS We are proud of the action we have taken to ensure Canada has a world-class regulatory framework and a means for the safest form of transportation for our energy products. EOS BOS We have been clear that projects will only proceed if they are safe for Canadians and safe for the environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Democratic Institutions backed down on the weekend on the issue of electoral reform. EOS BOS She said, “ EOS BOS It means that there needs to be a conversation in the House of Commons including all parties.” EOS BOS Naturally, we agree with her, but she must go even further. EOS BOS I invite the minister to open up to the public. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister hold a referendum so that all Canadians can have a say on electoral reform? EOS BOS A referendum is required. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are absolutely committed to ensuring that the consultations we have on a pan-Canadian basis hear from all Canadians on how they want to modernize and improve our electoral system.
              I encourage the members opposite to participate in that discussion. I have not heard any ideas or thoughts about how they want to modernize that system yet, but it is important they put those forward. EOS BOS I really invite all members of the House to engage in that process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all Canadians must have the opportunity to express their opinion on electoral reform. EOS BOS This weekend, the Minister of Democratic Institutions said, “As far as any changes around democratic reform, we’re not going to proceed with any changes unless we have broad support. EOS BOS ”
              We have a good idea for the broad support: have a referendum. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me talk about what we will not do. EOS BOS Last time major democratic changes were introduced, it was by the Conservatives. EOS BOS It was the Fair Elections Act, which disenfranchised many voters. EOS BOS There were no consultations that occurred during that process. EOS BOS They did not engage Canadians. EOS BOS We want to do things differently. EOS BOS We want to ensure that the voices of Canadians are heard, that they are given the proper opportunity to be involved in modernizing their system. EOS BOS This was a clear campaign promise we made in the last election. EOS BOS More than 60% of Canadians voted for parties that said they wanted change EOS BOS . We are committed to making that change happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Democratic Institutions also said, “ EOS BOS So Canadians can rest assured that unless we have their broad buy-in, we're not moving forward with any changes.” EOS BOS Perhaps voting Canadians and those who contributed to greater voter participation in the last election because we did a good job want to keep the current electoral system. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister recognize that the best way to find out what Canadians want is to hold a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are absolutely committed to ensuring that the support of Canadians is behind the proposals we bring forward. EOS BOS The process we are going to engage, of talking to Canadians from coast to coast, not just about changing our voting system but looking at electronic voting, looking at the possibility of mandatory voting, recognizing that in a modern age our electoral systems, like the rest of the world, need to evolve, is something to which we are committed. EOS BOS I would ask the member opposite to engage constructively in that process, to engage in that dialogue, and work with us to create a better electoral system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister tried to seize total control of the House of Commons just because he did not get his own way. EOS BOS Motion No. 6 EOS BOS was only withdrawn after a massive backlash. EOS BOS However, it is not his only undemocratic attempt to seize control. EOS BOS Motion No. EOS BOS 5 sets up the committee to alter Canada's electoral system in the Liberals' favour. EOS BOS It gives Liberals a majority on the committee, ensures that the Liberal majority in the House will control the bill, and the final say will be made by the Liberal cabinet. EOS BOS Will the Liberals do the right thing and withdraw this motion as well? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the motion to create the committee is coming forward. EOS BOS There is going to be ample opportunity to hear from each and every member of the House around his or her ideas to improve and modernize our electoral system. EOS BOS The reality is that in the last election Canadians looked at the problems of the past, looked at the decade that preceded the last election, and said, in huge measure, that the status quo was not good enough, that we needed to do better. EOS BOS That is precisely what we are working on. EOS BOS That is precisely what the committee is getting to the heart of. EOS BOS I encourage members to engage in that process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister thinks that tracking a topic on Twitter is a better way of consulting Canadians than a referendum; #logical? EOS BOS Their motion gives Liberals on the committee total control of the process to fundamentally change the way Canadians vote; #thatseemsfair. EOS BOS We know the Liberals do not respect Parliament, and now we can see that they do not respect Canadians either; #arrogance #outoftouch #disrespect. EOS BOS If the minister truly wants widespread consultations, could she finally agree to holding a #referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I hear the hashtags opposite. EOS BOS I hear the member wanting to use different forums. EOS BOS Obviously there are many different ways that people can engage on this issue. EOS BOS There will be forums held in nearly every riding. EOS BOS I encourage members to host town halls. EOS BOS I encourage members to engage with their constituents. EOS BOS We will have a digital portal where Canadians' voices can be heard. EOS BOS It will be a dynamic conversation, and as we said, we will ensure that the will of Canadians is behind whatever we put forward. EOS BOS Help us to change the status quo, improve our system, and modernize our electoral system to bring us into the 21st century. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, from the chaos surrounding the government's about face on foreign investment in potash more than a year ago, the former minister of Industry promised a new policy, a definition of “net benefit” EOS BOS , greater transparency, enforceable conditions, quick remedies, reciprocity and commercial behaviour by state enterprises. EOS BOS He said that he would act “with alacrity”.However, now the new Minister of Industry says that there will be no new investment rules, even though the issues are more serious now, not less. EOS BOS Why is the new minister making a monkey out of the minister from Muskoka? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. EOS BOS We already made changes in 2009 to provide more transparency and to welcome foreign investment. EOS BOS Those guys, during 10 years, did nothing. EOS BOS They did not want to do anything about transparency. EOS BOS What we do will improve it. EOS BOS We are still improving it. EOS BOS We will welcome any foreign investment that will have a net benefit for Canada. EOS BOS We will continue working for economic growth and job creation, and not play cheap politics on the backs of the workers as they are doing now. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Conservatives continue to make partisan appointments and have even gone so far as to break the law to do so. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities is preparing to replace a member of the board of directors of the Quebec port authority without consulting users first, as required under the Canada Marine Act. EOS BOS The port's electoral college submitted names for consideration, which the minister did not even bother to look at, choosing instead to impose his preferred candidate. EOS BOS Why is the minister ignoring the recommendations that were made? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the normal process is now under way and an announcement will be made as soon as a decision is made. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, members will remember another incident involving the Conservatives and the Port of Quebec. EOS BOS Three years ago, the Department of Transport modified a press release to cover up the fact that the new CEO of the Port of Quebec did not have a university degree as the position required. EOS BOS We can see just how far the Conservatives are willing to go to take care of their friends. EOS BOS Where is the transparency that this government has been promising since taking office six years ago? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, as I just said, the process must run its course. EOS BOS We will make an announcement as soon as there is something to announce. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first nations people across Canada, in fact, all Canadians, deserve financial transparency from their communities. EOS BOS The lack of action from the current government and the empty words from the Minister of Indigenous Affairs are completely unacceptable. EOS BOS The minister seems keen to making it almost impossible for first nations people to have access to the financial audits for their community. EOS BOS The minister is not enforcing the First Nations Financial Transparency Act. EOS BOS Why is the minister endorsing and allowing first nations leadership to break the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think it is quite obvious that on this side of the House we do not believe in a process that is top down. EOS BOS We believe in working with first nations and all indigenous people across the country. EOS BOS We see transparency, openness, and accountability as one of the hallmarks of doing that, but we are not going to implement something the Conservatives tried to shove down the throats of indigenous people. EOS BOS We are going to work with them to develop a transparency process that works for all indigenous people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the First Nations Financial Transparency Act was put in place because grassroots first nations, like the Blood Tribe, requested increased transparency from their elected leaders. EOS BOS Some first nations bands continue to file their transparency act disclosures despite refusal by the Liberals to enforce the law, because they, too, recognize its benefit to their members. EOS BOS This minister is harming first nations people by restricting easy access to financial information. EOS BOS When will she start enforcing the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government and first nations governments want more transparency. EOS BOS They want it increased, and they want more accountability. EOS BOS However, they do not want made-in-Ottawa solutions that are going to be forced upon them. EOS BOS What I would say to the member opposite is that we are not prepared to enforce the top-down, regulatory process that they had in place, but rather we will work with first nations to ensure full transparency and full accountability for the work they do. EOS BOS We will not penalize them in the meantime. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the epitome of top-down is the process that the Liberals have undertaken. EOS BOS We are talking about grassroots band members who are facing critical information, and the positive path forward is transparency as they look at how they move ahead. EOS BOS The reality is band members from Semiahmoo asked for financial information hundreds of times over 18 years. EOS BOS When the transparency act finally revealed that things were not as comfortable as they should have been, the council did not like it. EOS BOS They have stopped filing, and now that information is no longer available. EOS BOS How does the minister justify that this information is not available to the membership? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to be clear. EOS BOS The member knows that that is wrong. EOS BOS All first nations governments and individuals have access to information. EOS BOS There is a process they have to go through. EOS BOS However, what the minister decided last winter is that she would not use her discretionary power to unfairly punish the members of first nations by withholding important program funding from them, something the Conservatives wanted to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the First Nations Financial Transparency Act also provides insight into successful band management practices. EOS BOS I think there is a great example that was reported in The province, where the Osoyoos first nations is one of the most business-minded in Canada. EOS BOS There is virtually no unemployment. EOS BOS The chief's salary has been frozen for two years and is at a reasonable level. EOS BOS Thanks to the transparency act, other bands and other people can look at the financial statements, see how they are structured and perhaps look at some of the best practices. EOS BOS Does the minister not realize that shared information is a benefit to one and all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, there is a process whereby all members can access the information and transparency around our budgets. EOS BOS After any allegation of misuse of public funds, we take that very seriously as a government. EOS BOS We have also conducted forensic audits when we felt that it was necessary to do so. EOS BOS We ensure that the funds that are allocated are used for what they are intended. EOS BOS We will continue to work with first nations to implement a process that is fair, accountable, and transparent, that they are a part of, and is not something that was dictated by the former government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 126 first nation reserves have unsafe drinking water. EOS BOS In Scandinavia and Europe, zero communities have unsafe drinking water. EOS BOS One such reserve is Shoal Lake 40, in Thunder Bay—Rainy River, which has had to boil its water for 17 years. EOS BOS The reserve wants to know, and the Council of Canadians wants to know. EOS BOS Why does Winnipeg get safe water from Shoal Lake while the first nations on that very same lake do not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, our government continues to take action on first nations across Canada so that they have the same quality of drinking water as all other Canadians. EOS BOS That is why, since 2006, we have invested approximately $3 billion in first nations' water and waste water infrastructure and related public health activities. EOS BOS We have made targeted investments in more than 130 major projects and funded maintenance of over 1,200 waste water and water treatment projects. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, in the economic action plan of 2014, we committed a further $320 million for two years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in Victoria, people are dying from drug overdoses in record numbers. EOS BOS Last week, we lost five people in 72 hours. EOS BOS Since January, we have lost 56 in Victoria and 622 across B.C.
               The government has done nothing to change a Conservative law that makes it extremely difficult to open safe injection sites. EOS BOS Vancouver Mayor Robertson has called on the government to speed up the application process. EOS BOS Will the minister move immediately to expedite these applications and declare the opioid crisis a national health emergency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I share the concern of the member for Victoria for this very serious problem. EOS BOS Members need to know that six or seven people die every day in our country as a result of opioid overdose. EOS BOS That is simply unacceptable. EOS BOS I share the member's grief and his passion. EOS BOS I work on this file every day. EOS BOS I have already enumerated many of the actions that we have taken. EOS BOS We will take steps to make sure that safe, supervised consumption sites are available in the country. EOS BOS Every step that we can take will be done in collaboration with our partners. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. EOS BOS That is why we have introduced the safe streets and communities act and numerous other tough on crime reforms since 2006. EOS BOS However, the NDP member for Burnaby—New Westminster says that these reforms to increase the sentences of sex offenders and ensure that murderers are not eligible for early parole will cost $19 billion and are not worth it. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please tell the House what he thinks of this shocking statement? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the member for Burnaby—New Westminster cites a report by a left wing think tank that has been widely discredited. EOS BOS The number is false. EOS BOS Our entire tough on crime agenda is estimated to cost $2.7 billion over five years. EOS BOS In fact, our costs are based on estimates of a prison population that has failed to materialize. EOS BOS That will mean even more savings. EOS BOS The NDP's willingness to distort the facts and attempt to mislead Canadians shows how reckless the NDP is and the danger it presents to Canada's interests and Canada's victims of crime. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians value the work that our front-line police officers do every day to keep our streets and communities safe, and this often comes at no small price to their own personal safety. EOS BOS Yesterday, near the town of Breton next to my riding, there was a serious incident involving the shooting of an individual who had barricaded himself in his home and exchanged gunfire with the RCMP. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please update the House on the status of this incident? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his unwavering support of our front line police officers. I am happy to report that yesterday the RCMP, in co-operation with the Edmonton Police Service, safely secured a very dangerous situation and successfully arrested their suspect. EOS BOS I would specifically thank the two RCMP officers who sustained gunshot wounds while securing the premises. EOS BOS On behalf of the government, we wish them a very speedy recovery. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to Reuters, the Minister of Agriculture has single-handedly launched a trade war against the United States by calling the country a schoolyard bully. EOS BOS The minister tends to see enemies everywhere, particularly when his own negligence is involved, as in the listeriosis and E. coli crises and the grain transportation fiasco. EOS BOS Rather than insulting our main trading partner, why does the minister not seek to improve the living conditions of our farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite would know that Canada is a large agricultural trading nation, the third largest in the world. EOS BOS We rely on multilateral and bilateral trade agreements. EOS BOS We want to see them successful. EOS BOS We are a very strategic partner in the movement forward on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. EOS BOS We continue to make arguments on behalf of Canadian agriculture, as well as all the industries that will be affected. EOS BOS We will never sign an agreement that is not in the best interest of the Canadian economy. EOS BOS However, at the same time, what I am getting phone calls from farmers about right now is when the NDP is going to pay back all the money it has ripped off from Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how can anybody believe the minister's claim of standing up for farmers? EOS BOS Even by his own measure, he is failing them: CETA is in limbo, and the grain transport crisis cost farmers billions of dollars. EOS BOS Now he is turning an agricultural trade dispute with the U.S. into name-calling and finger-pointing, calling the Americans schoolyard bullies. EOS BOS He just loses credibility, and farmers are actually paying for it. EOS BOS Beyond juvenile outbursts, what is the minister doing to actually improve this agricultural trade crisis, and where is his plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since NAFTA put some rules in place, we work with the Americans on the WTO, we work with them on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we also have other trade agreements that involve the Americans as we pass through merchandise to Mexico. EOS BOS It is always incumbent on us to ensure that those trade routes stay open. EOS BOS There will be disputes, but we continue to work with our partners in the U.S. I was at a trilateral meeting in Mexico just a couple of weeks ago, where I and the Secretary of Agriculture for the U.S. and the Secretary of Agriculture for Mexico started hammering out some of these deals. EOS BOS We continue to work on behalf of Canadian agriculture. EOS BOS I wish the NDP would do the same. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Conservatives' attack on old age security shows just how out of touch with reality the government is. EOS BOS After six years of mismanagement, they now want to penalize Canadians who have worked and saved their whole lives. EOS BOS Yesterday, the NDP moved a motion to protect old age security so that all Canadians can retire in dignity. EOS BOS Will the government clarify its intentions here in the House, not in Davos? EOS BOS Or will the government force people to wait until they turn 67 before they can collect their retirement benefits? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the NDP is the party on the attack, and they are attacking Canadians. EOS BOS They say that there will be cuts, which is not true. EOS BOS We will not stand for that. EOS BOS What we are trying to do— EOS BOS what we will do—is protect the old age security program for the current generation, of course, as well as for future generations. EOS BOS The program must be made viable; currently it is not. EOS BOS We will protect the old age security program. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, the justice department sent a threatening letter to USW Local 1005, ordering the steelworkers to cease their information pickets on the Burlington lift bridge. EOS BOS However, these workers are simply doing what the federal government is refusing to do. EOS BOS They are trying to stop U.S. Steel from taking profits from its Hamilton operations until the federal government's court case against the company is resolved. EOS BOS Instead of getting tough on Canadian workers, when will the government get tough on foreign companies that break Canadian laws, undermine Canadian jobs and attack Canadian pensions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member opposite on her recent election in the same area that I come from, and I thank the residents of Halton for returning me to the House. EOS BOS As the member opposite knows, this matter is one of provincial regulation. EOS BOS However, we are monitoring the situation, as we would, and I speak to the Minister of Labour in Ontario on the matter almost on a monthly basis to ensure that we can keep track of what is going on there. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with just nine days until the old deal expires, all indications are that the Liberals will not be able to reach a new softwood lumber deal with the Americans. EOS BOS In any case, that is what the forestry industry is expecting, and it is preparing for its exports to be taxed. EOS BOS A trade war will likely force plants to close and cost the industry thousands of jobs. EOS BOS In the absence of an agreement, will the government come up with a plan to support the Canadian softwood lumber industry, such as an emergency loan guarantee program, for instance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that the softwood lumber agreement expired under the previous government's watch. EOS BOS For months now, we have been actively involved in negotiations. EOS BOS In fact, we had a very productive meeting in Saguenay this summer with industry producers and workers. EOS BOS I met with Michael Froman, the U.S. trade representative, three weeks ago in Washington, and I will be meeting with him again on Wednesday in Toronto. EOS BOS We want the best deal for Canadian workers, not just any deal. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to end the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all. EOS BOS This is a measure that has burdened law-abiding hunters, farmers and sport shooters for 17 years. EOS BOS According to the CBC, it has cost Canadian taxpayers over $2 billion and has not stopped a single crime or saved a single life. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety please update the House on the progress of ending the long gun registry? EOS BOS Does she have some good news for us? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to report that today the Senate will vote for the last time on ending the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. EOS BOS We are all counting the hours until the moment comes when law-abiding Canadians will no longer have to register their long guns. EOS BOS We committed to Canadians that we would end the long gun registry, and they gave us the mandate to do so. EOS BOS We are grateful that we will be able to follow through on our commitment and end the long gun registry once and for all. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is wrong. EOS BOS Fourteen OECD countries have done better than we have at combatting unemployment. EOS BOS The cornerstone of last year's budget was supposed to be matching jobs with job seekers. EOS BOS However, instead of investing in this priority, the government chose to cut $300 million from the provinces in its budget and then asked them to contribute $300 million to a program it concocted without them. EOS BOS Then the government wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on propaganda to make people think this program existed. EOS BOS What will the government do to fix this boondoggle? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is rather strange to hear that the Liberal Party is against job training programs that lead to jobs. EOS BOS The principle of the Canada job grant program is to guarantee jobs for people who receive training and to increase private sector investment in worker training. EOS BOS That makes sense, and that is why the majority of Canadian business groups strongly support the Canada job grant program. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister arrived in South Korea to lead Canada's delegation to the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit. EOS BOS With countries like Iran and North Korea that continue to obfuscate their nuclear activities and ignore their international obligations, it is clear that no nation is immune to the consequences of a nuclear terrorist attack. EOS BOS Will the parliamentary secretary please tell the House how Canada has played a leadership role in the global efforts to fight and end nuclear terrorism? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government believes that nuclear terrorism is one of the biggest threats to global security. EOS BOS Sadly, no country is immune from the consequences of a nuclear terrorist attack. EOS BOS Canada has been a leader in the global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism. EOS BOS We are pleased to be delivering on one of our 2010 summit commitments. EOS BOS We are working in places like Mexico and Vietnam to keep nuclear materials safe and out of the hands of terrorists. EOS BOS Through our global partnership program, Canada has invested more than $85 million for nuclear security work in Russia. EOS BOS It is vital that we continue to work together with our allies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday we all stood in the House to recognize World AIDS Day and renew our pledge to beat this disease. EOS BOS World AIDS Day has come and gone, but the work is not done. EOS BOS For the first time ever, the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria had to cancel its annual funding round because donors like Canada are reneging on their commitments. EOS BOS Despite its promise, the government has yet to transfer even one penny to the fund. EOS BOS When will the government make good on its commitment and support the global fund? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada is very proud to be one of the largest contributors to the global fund. EOS BOS Our contributions are on track and we will fulfill our commitments. EOS BOS Our contributions are making a difference. EOS BOS For example, the rate of TB infections is down for the first time in decades, more mothers and children are getting access to malaria drugs, and 3.2 million people are getting treatment for AIDS.When this government makes a commitment, we live up to it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last weekend at the Alberta beer fest, literally hundreds of craft brewers, distillers, and Canadians were asking me why beer, wine, and spirits are not part of the Canadian free trade agreement. EOS BOS They were asking why, rather than supporting a policy that will ensure that Canadian entrepreneurs can be successful, the Liberals saddled them with a tax hike that will increase each and every year. EOS BOS The Liberals have a chance to do the right thing. EOS BOS They have a second chance to stand up for the Canadian economy. EOS BOS Will the Liberals act as an intervenor in the Supreme Court case on Canadian free trade? EOS BOS Will they help free the beer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we pursued a very clear path, working with the provinces and territories, in helping liberalize alcohol. EOS BOS As you know, Mr. Speaker, I do not consume alcohol, but this is a priority for me and our government, and this is why we worked very closely with the provinces and territories to make sure it was part of the Canadian free trade agreement. EOS BOS This historic agreement is going to, again, create an environment that is going to help businesses and consumers. EOS BOS It is going to provide more choice and better price points for consumers. EOS BOS With regard to alcohol, we are going to continue to work with the provinces in a manner that is going to be productive, thoughtful, and progressive, a good result for Canadian consumers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, flight attendants are concerned about the Conservatives' decision to reduce the minimum number of flight attendants required on domestic flights. EOS BOS This decision could affect the safety of passengers since it reduces the number of people available to help them. EOS BOS We have seen the impact that relaxing the rules has had in the railway industry. EOS BOS The main union for flight attendants has requested a meeting with the minister to discuss the situation. EOS BOS Will she agree to that request? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the carriers from the U.S. and Europe utilize the same standard every day as they fly through our airspace. EOS BOS As a result, there has been a request for a regulation change for a new process. EOS BOS In fact, on May 22, we had a full public consultation on this matter, and I have received a letter from the CUPE president. EOS BOS In truth, because CUPE is currently suing Transport Canada, it would be inappropriate to meet. EOS
BOS I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of: In the category of distinguished Canadians, this University of Ottawa alumnus is the honorary chair of the campaign cabinet of the University of Ottawa and the popular host of Jeopardy. EOS BOS Who is—Alex Trebek? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS The hon. opposition House leader is rising on a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week the Minister of Natural Resources insulted aboriginal communities, calling some of them “socially dysfunctional”. EOS BOS Remarkably, he then defended the insult as supportive of economic opportunities for aboriginal peoples. EOS BOS I invite the minister to extend an apology in this place now. EOS BOS Could the minister also explain how killing the aboriginal skills and employment partnership program offers hope that his government's touted commitment that those very aboriginal communities most impacted by major industry will also benefit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has a jobs and economic prosperity agenda. EOS BOS That is the agenda we have been pursuing with our aboriginal peoples as well. EOS BOS We have demonstrated great progress. EOS BOS We continue with pilot programs across the country that deal with jobs and skills development. EOS BOS This is an important area. EOS BOS It is one of the outcomes of the crown-first nations gathering. EOS BOS We are making real progress. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, more and more people are concerned about whether Bill C-14 on medical assistance in dying is constitutional. EOS BOS On the weekend, we heard from some of the Liberal Party faithful, former prime minister Paul Martin, and former Liberal leader Bob Rae. EOS BOS The government cannot get such an important issue wrong. EOS BOS It is not too late. EOS BOS This evening, Bill C-14 can be amended. EOS BOS Will the Liberals work with the opposition to ensure that Bill C-14 complies with the charter and the Supreme Court decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to moving forward with Bill C-14 and have engaged very broadly on this really complex and deeply personal issue. EOS BOS We have a deadline of June 6 to meet that has been directed by the Supreme Court of Canada. EOS BOS We are committed to having in place, it is our responsibility as parliamentarians, a legal framework in this country that ensures we find the right balance between personal autonomy, protection of the vulnerable, and ensuring there is access in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government needs to stop giving incomplete information. EOS BOS There is no rush. EOS BOS The professional associations are prepared. EOS BOS They have directives in place to protect the vulnerable. EOS BOS We need to get this right. EOS BOS The government is insisting on passing a bill that a number of experts have deemed unconstitutional. EOS BOS We are talking about charter rights. EOS BOS The government knows very well that its law will be challenged if it is not amended. EOS BOS When will the government work with the opposition to bring the bill in line with the charter? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to working with all parliamentarians and have done so on this piece of legislation as we move forward. EOS BOS We have the utmost respect for the Supreme Court of Canada. EOS BOS We are ensuring that we do everything possible to meet the deadline of June 6. EOS BOS We have the utmost confidence that this is the best public policy approach to medical assistance in dying in this country right now. EOS BOS We will ensure that we can move forward with that legal framework to provide access as well as the protection of the vulnerable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem with the minister's response is that the Alberta Court of Appeal, the Canadian Bar Association, Barreau du Québec, constitutional experts, and now even former Prime Minister Martin all agree, Bill C-14 in its present form is likely not constitutional. EOS BOS Even if the bill is passed next week, it will be tied up in legal challenges for years to come, and costly, exhausting court battles for suffering Canadians who just want to see their legal rights vindicated. EOS BOS Why will the government not do the right thing and work with us to get the bill right the first time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to ensuring that we have in place by the Supreme Court deadline of June 6 a legal framework for medical assistance in dying in this country.
              I know that there is an incredible diversity of opinion around this incredibly complex and challenging issue. EOS BOS As legislators, we need to answer the 36 million people who live in this country in terms of putting in place a regime. EOS BOS Again, I am confident that this is the best approach for Canada in terms of medical assistance in dying right now, and it is the first step. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, government members keep hiding behind the June 6 deadline, as they call it, as an excuse, but now even former Liberal leaders, Bob Rae and Paul Martin agree there is nothing to fear. EOS BOS If this bill does not pass next week, the Carter decision itself provides the criteria for determining who is eligible and the provinces are now prepared and have already released guidelines for their physicians. EOS BOS We have the time we need to fix this, so will the government stop ramming through this deeply flawed bill and work with us to get it right? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this question gives me an opportunity to explain why it is so important that we get a piece of legislation in place at the soonest possible date. EOS BOS Without legislation in place, health care providers will not have the legal framework that they require to proceed. EOS BOS They will be advised to seek legal consults. EOS BOS This will cause serious problems in accessing. EOS BOS Not only that, the Canadian Pharmacists Association has made it clear that there will be no protection for pharmacists to dispense medication. EOS BOS We need to get this legislation in place as soon as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday I received an urgent email from a constituent. EOS BOS He is concerned about the government's new gender identification requirements in the identity screening regulations to board an aircraft. EOS BOS He will be heading to a convention in San Diego this weekend along with Canadian transvestite and transgendered delegates. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Transport tell this group if they will be allowed to travel? EOS BOS A simple yes or no will suffice. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, safety at our airports is an important issue for our government. EOS BOS We have placed a lot of money and support toward what we have done. EOS BOS Any travellers crossing the border and going outside the country will be identified. EOS BOS We will continue to do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Kathryn Spirit represents another threat to the St. Lawrence. EOS BOS After four winters moored to a makeshift wharf in Beauharnois, it continues to rust in Lac Saint-Louis, a drinking water reservoir for Beauharnois and the greater Montreal area. EOS BOS The superintendent responsible for the ship reports that there have been several acts of vandalism recently. EOS BOS If the ship were to catch fire, it would be catastrophic for the St. Lawrence ecosystem. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Transport finally do something and have the Kathryn Spirit moved out of Lac Saint-Louis once and for all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with respect to Canadians' health and safety, that is our top priority, and indeed, vessel owners have to comply with stringent safety and environmental obligations before proceeding with towing operations. EOS BOS It is for that reason that the Kathryn Spirit is under a departure prohibition from Transport Canada, and it will remain in place until the final inspection has been taken out and it confirms that all regulations are being complied with. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, indigenous women in Canada are more likely to be victims of violence. EOS BOS Many studies have shown that being a survivor of violence has a significant impact on mental health, but for women on reserves in rural and remote communities, mental health supports and services are often inadequate or non-existent. EOS BOS Will the health minister work with indigenous communities to ensure that culturally sensitive mental health services are available to all women? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to this important question EOS BOS .I would agree with the member opposite that for indigenous women in particular, violence can often contribute to real challenges in mental health. EOS BOS We are fully committed as a government to responding to the mental health needs of Canadians. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has asked me to make sure that we increase access to mental health services for all Canadians. EOS BOS I would be particularly interested in working with the member opposite to ensure that we can provide adequate mental health services to indigenous women and men in her community and in all Canadian communities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, heavy rains caused serious damage in the Eastern Townships on Tuesday, particularly in the municipalities of Coaticook and Compton. EOS BOS Dozens of people had to be evacuated when over 80 millimetres of rain fell in just a few hours. EOS BOS Many residents and business owners suffered serious damage. EOS BOS This represents a lot of money to these merchants and farmers. EOS BOS What does the government plan to do to help our region, which has been affected by the recent flooding? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, our hearts always go out to communities affected by natural disasters. EOS BOS That is why our government strengthened the framework to help communities through an established mechanism. EOS BOS As members will recall, we did this for Lac-Mégantic. EOS BOS Of course, some factors must be in place to set that process in motion. I would remind my hon. EOS BOS colleague that we also went ahead with an investment in anticipation of natural disasters. EOS BOS Unfortunately, we could not count on our colleagues' support, but we will continue to be there for our communities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I may not be the Amazing Kreskin, but it is getting all too predictable what we are going to hear in Conservative talking points on climate. EOS BOS I want to be really clear about this. EOS BOS I have been asking repeatedly whether the current administration remains committed to the target it picked and the Prime Minister signed on to in 2009 in Copenhagen. EOS BOS Environment Canada data make it clear we will not hit that target. EOS BOS According to Maclean's magazine on April 9, this minister and the Prime Minister remain committed to the target. EOS BOS Are they committed? EOS BOS Is there going to be a plan? EOS BOS When will we see it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since 2006, our government has invested significant funds in more efficient technology, better infrastructure and adaptation, and clean energy. EOS BOS We have taken actions on two of the largest sources of emissions in this country, including the transportation and electricity sectors. EOS BOS In fact, in the first 21 years of coal regulations, we expect to see accumulative reductions in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to removing 2.6 million vehicles from the road. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, many residents of Longueuil, and Montreal in general, take public transit across the Champlain Bridge. EOS BOS Yet this government still refuses to confirm its plans for that sector. EOS BOS Will there be designated bus lanes? EOS BOS Will there be light rail? EOS BOS Too many questions remain unanswered. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we know that the future hinges on improving public transit. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives commit to providing the people with the services they need on the Champlain Bridge? EOS BOS When? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the minister has already announced plans to replace the Champlain Bridge. EOS BOS So we are making progress. EOS BOS We are examining the impact on the local environment. EOS BOS As for the broader question of public transit, our government had made investments and achieved results. EOS BOS For instance, the average age of infrastructure in Canada is coming down for the first time in 30 years. EOS BOS This proves that we are investing in our infrastructure and in public transit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is the most predictable thing in Canadian politics. EOS BOS Someone says “ EOS BOS Muslim” and a Conservative minister says “terrorist”. EOS BOS Yesterday, when asked about rising hate crimes against Muslims, the Minister of Public Safety felt obliged to talk about terrorists. EOS BOS We also saw yesterday that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration assumes all Muslim women who wear the veil are terrorists, unless proven otherwise. EOS BOS This is simply unacceptable, so will he apologize to all Muslim Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course that is not what I said, and if the hon. EOS BOS member wishes to repeat those remarks outside of this chamber, we will have a reckoning with him on the facts of this matter. EOS BOS The real question is this. EOS BOS Why will the Liberal Party not tell the truth about its sorry record on immigration over decades and its inability and unwillingness to do anything to face up to the real threat of terrorism in this day and age?Liberals have done nothing to strengthen our measures to fight terrorism, to cancel passports, to take action against ISIL. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is obvious from the minister's previous statement that he equates terrorism with niqabs. EOS BOS When only Muslims face a rise in hate crimes, it is obvious that the government's toxic anti-Muslim rhetoric is a part of the problem. EOS BOS As when he talks about terrorists plots in mosques, this is the only Prime Minister in my lifetime who sinks to attack a whole community for political gain. EOS BOS Will he at least apologize to Muslim Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, those are the most outrageous untruths I have yet to hear in this place. EOS BOS This is the only party in this Parliament that is taking action to protect Muslims and other Canadians from the threat of terrorism. EOS BOS I would invite that member to apologize for decades of racism by his party under Mackenzie King, blocking South Asians from coming to this country, blocking East Asians from coming to this country, blocking Caribbeans from coming to this country. EOS BOS There was also the injustice of backlogs under the Trudeau regime and the Chrétien era. EOS BOS It is that party that has been the racist party in this Parliament over decades. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the kindest thing we can say about our millionaire finance minister's conduct in the sale of these shares before he introduced his tax measures is that by selling those shares at that time, he avoided paying the same tax increases that he would impose on others at the end of the month. EOS BOS Unfortunately, low-income people suffering from diabetes do not have access to the same kind of sophisticated tax manoeuvres the minister used. 
              Why does the Liberal government continue to raise taxes on those with the least while letting the wealthy get off scot-free? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government pledged that the CRA would administer measures for persons with disabilities in a fair, transparent, and accessible way. EOS BOS Last week, I was proud to announce that the disability advisory committee, which our colleagues opposite disbanded in 2006 when they were in government, was being reinstated. EOS BOS By reinstating the committee, the agency will benefit from its advice about enhancing the quality and accessibility of the services it provides to persons with disabilities and their families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, so that is the consolation the government says to people with diabetes, that they lost their $1,500 tax credit but that is okay because the government has given them a committee instead. EOS BOS That minister's office said the CRA had not changed its decision-making process with regard to the disability tax credit eligibility criteria. EOS BOS Now we have an internal memo that was sent from senior officials in her department to 51 other officials that says that people with diabetes are now excluded. EOS BOS Why did the minister mislead the House in that matter? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all Canadians must receive the tax credits to which they are entitled. EOS BOS I am pleased to say that there was a 20% increase in the number of approvals of this credit between 2014 and 2016. EOS BOS We put in place measures to make these credits more accessible, and they are working. EOS BOS We reduced the length of the application form and we are allowing specialized nurse practitioners to fill out the forms. EOS BOS We will continue to work with the most vulnerable Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, she told the House, “ EOS BOS There have also not been any changes to the way the law is interpreted. EOS BOS ” She also said, “ EOS BOS The rules are the same and apply just as they always have. EOS BOS ” We now know, through an internal document released by ATIP today, that an internal CRA memo, sent to dozens of officials, urged those officials to reject all diabetics for the tax credit, except in exceptional circumstances EOS BOS .
              Why did the minister mislead the House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is implementing important measures to help the most vulnerable Canadians. EOS BOS In 2015-16, our government invested more than $41 million in diabetes research. EOS BOS In budget 2017, we are investing $5 billion in mental health supports for about 500,000 young people. EOS BOS No changes have been made to the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit, and we are continuing our efforts on behalf of the most vulnerable Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in this memo that went to 51 different officials in her department, the top decision-makers indicated that except for rare circumstances, diabetics were to be rejected every time. EOS BOS The minister denied the existence of any change in the practice or the policy. EOS BOS We now know that was not true. EOS BOS She stated in the House falsehoods, and her department has raised taxes on the most vulnerable people in the country. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all Canadians must receive the tax credits to which they are entitled. EOS BOS No changes have been made to the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit. EOS BOS I am pleased to say that the number of approvals rose by 20% between 2014 and 2016. EOS BOS We have taken action and I will continue to work for the most vulnerable as I have done throughout my life. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives made cuts to funding and to the staff who maintain the graves of our Canadian heroes. EOS BOS They did this following an audit that pointed to the deplorable state of these graves. EOS BOS Today, we learned that half the money for research on veterans that the minister claimed was new funding comes from existing programs. EOS BOS We are talking about a very small amount. EOS BOS How many more reasons does the Prime Minister need to dismiss his incompetent minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have made significant investments in restoring Canadian war graves and sending hundreds of Canadian veterans back to visit the battlefields of Europe. EOS BOS The opposition has voted against these initiatives, and I can cite time after time when it let us down. EOS BOS It let veterans down, and it let our deceased soldiers down. EOS BOS Our Second World War veterans who returned to Italy last week noted how beautifully maintained our Canadian grave sites are, and we are in fact proud of the work that we are doing at home and abroad. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they are not proud of this minister, that is for sure. EOS BOS Major Mark Campbell, a veteran with 33 years of service, was badly wounded in Afghanistan by an IED while rescuing a fellow soldier. EOS BOS Now he is fighting the Conservatives for a pension. EOS BOS The government has stated in court that providing this pension would violate fundamental principles of democracy. EOS BOS Could the minister please tell the House which democratic principles would be violated by providing this brave veteran and double amputee with his pension? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are profoundly proud of and honoured by the service that veterans have rendered to this country in the interests of freedom, democracy, and human rights. EOS BOS However, in this particular case, the government does not comment on matters before the court, except to say that this matter deals with something that all parties agreed to under the previous government. EOS BOS It was the Liberal government that initiated much of what is in debate today. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives claim all sorts of new funding for veterans, but it is a sham. EOS BOS Today, we learned that half of the so-called new programs the minister speaks of already exist, and experts say that it is a very meagre amount of money. EOS BOS Conservatives claim in the House that they honour the sacred obligation, but that is a sham too, because in court they are still fighting Canadian veterans represented by the Equitas Society, claiming that no such obligation exists. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives realize that “lest we forget” means both commemorating the dead and taking care of our living veterans, like Mark Campbell? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his passion on this issue, but as I indicated earlier, this matter is now before the courts. EOS BOS Out of respect for due process, I think that all of us should let the courts do their work EOS BOS .I am at a loss for words to explain how it is that the Liberals would vote against earnings loss and supplementary retirement benefits, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Korea transition services, disability awards and allowances, disability and death benefits, and I could go on. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, veterans no longer trust this minister who has repeatedly tried to mislead them. EOS BOS A responsible minister would dispense with the underhanded legal tactics, reopen the regional offices and rehire the staff in charge of helping veterans. EOS BOS He would invest in mental health without delay and he would apply the recommendations of the parliamentary committee. EOS BOS Since the minister is doing absolutely nothing to help veterans, when will the Conservatives do something and dismiss this irresponsible minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to report that, consistently, since we have been in power in government, through the leadership of our Prime Minister, veterans have been a primary issue for us. EOS BOS Time and again, we have put forward initiatives and support systems dealing with veterans and their families. EOS BOS However, the party opposite continues to vote against them. EOS BOS The hypocrisy is more than anybody can bear. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister tried to have us believe that the staffing cuts would have absolutely no impact on veterans, saying that it was just administrative staff that was cut. EOS BOS That is not true. EOS BOS The Auditor General's report clearly shows that the wait times have direct consequences on the health and quality of life of our veterans. EOS BOS Cutting one in four jobs and closing nine regional offices clearly has an impact on the quality of services. EOS BOS Parliament put $1 billion aside for this purpose. EOS BOS Why was that money not spent? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in our continued effort to improve veterans benefits and programs, I recommended that the Auditor General should review our mental health program. EOS BOS I fully accept his recommendations and no doubt, am grateful for them. EOS BOS The Auditor General found that Veterans Affairs spends half a billion dollars each year on mental health strategy and also on valuable mental health supports. EOS BOS While we have already taken action to improve the service delivery, we will in fact continue to follow the Auditor General's recommendation, which, by the way, also stroked some very positive things in his report. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are failing veterans right across the board. EOS BOS They stand in the House and dismiss the crisis that they created when they gutted departments and fired the staff who helped veterans access the services they so desperately need. EOS BOS Nine regional offices are now closed and one in four employees has been fired. EOS BOS The Prime Minister  has the audacity to call people helping injured soldiers in those regional offices “backroom bureaucrats”. EOS BOS Instead of making excuses for that failed minister, will the Prime Minister finally just show him the door? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all I can say is that on this side of the House, we have consistently been improving the quality of life support systems and assistance to veterans and their families. EOS BOS It is very difficult for me to understand, though, how the New Democrats would vote against disability and death compensation, how they would vote against the veterans ombudsman, how they would vote against the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, how they would vote against earnings loss and supplementary benefits and, also, how they would vote against children of deceased veterans education assistance. EOS BOS I do not get it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, too little too late. EOS BOS The Conservatives pedal their weak and petty excuses in this place, but the truth is they are going to court to fight disabled veterans injured in Afghanistan. EOS BOS While lying in a hospital bed, Major Mark Campbell, who lost both his legs above the knee in a Taliban ambush, found out that the government had stripped him of his military pension. EOS BOS He is one of seven veterans who has gone to court to gain access to compensation that was promised. EOS BOS Why is the government going to court to break those promises and the hearts of our veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to get through to people who are not listening. EOS BOS My response— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Veterans Affairs still has the floor. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS minister of Veterans Affairs. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my concern, and it should be the concern of the NDP, is that in our country we have great respect for due process. EOS BOS In that regard, this matter is before the courts. EOS BOS It is really shameful that people would drag a sidebar issue into a due diligence court process that we should, in our country, respect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism does not intervene by tomorrow, two young homosexual men, David Perez and Pablo Gonzalez, will be deported to Mexico. EOS BOS The two fear for their safety if they return to Mexico, but the Canada Border Services Agency has refused to delay their removal pending an appeal on humanitarian grounds. EOS BOS Will the minister intervene and stop this forced removal until the appeal is heard? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have a very fair asylum system, but it is a legal system, not a political system. EOS BOS It is up to the courts, to the quasi-judicial bodies such as the Immigration and Refugee Board, and to the Federal Court, to decide whether or not people are refugees who need Canada's protection. EOS BOS It is totally inappropriate for members of Parliament or even ministers to reverse the legal decisions of our just legal system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that when they return to Mexico, these two men and their family members will again be subjected to threats, violence and persecution. EOS BOS Before coming to Canada, they were attacked many times by the authorities that should have been protecting them. EOS BOS Mr. Perez and Mr. Gonzalez have legitimate reasons to fear for their lives if they leave Canada. EOS BOS What steps is this government taking to ensure that violence against these men and other members of Mexico's homosexual community is taken seriously? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this Parliament created the Immigration and Refugee Board to examine asylum claims on the basis of evidence and the criteria permitted by our laws. EOS BOS It is up to the board to decide if a person is being persecuted or if the personal safety of that person is threatened. EOS BOS It is up to the Federal Court to review those decisions. EOS BOS There is even a pre-removal risk assessment. EOS BOS If the appeal is denied, another appeal to the Federal Court is possible. EOS BOS That means that we have a fair and just system for all asylum seekers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, everyone agrees that it is scandalous that $50 million was taken from the border infrastructure fund to fund projects in the riding of the minister hosting the G8 summit. EOS BOS The fact that this same minister is now in charge of the Treasury Board is also scandalous and source of worry for the country's taxpayers. EOS BOS Even more disconcerting is that the minister does not even try to explain his actions. EOS BOS Can someone at least try to justify these poor choices and finally give us some real answers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, 32 public infrastructure projects were supported. EOS BOS Each of the 32 projects was completed on time. EOS BOS Each of the 32 projects was fully accounted for and every single dollar was spent on public infrastructure. EOS BOS I do notice that it is not only the President of the Treasury Board who is speaking glowingly about all these public infrastructure projects, I have a news release from a former Liberal MP, Anthony Rota, saying he is expressing his pleasure with the minister's announcement that the government has approved a funding request for the Jack Garland Airport. EOS BOS How was that funded? EOS BOS Out of the G8 legacy fund. EOS BOS Even the Liberals are supporting these great public infrastructure projects. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the minister was taking advantage of the money in the border infrastructure fund, the Canada Border Services Agency had to close three posts and reduce hours in order to save money. EOS BOS Can the President of the Treasury Board—yes, the President of the Treasury Board—tell the Canadians who will be affected by these cuts and who will have to wait in line at customs this summer how the investments in his riding, 300 kilometres from the border, will help reduce congestion? EOS BOS How will that shorten line-ups at the border? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the government did is use the authority of an existing program to fast-track these public infrastructure projects at the height of the global economic downturn. EOS BOS These investments were all part of Canada's economic action plan, a plan that has helped to create 560,000 net new jobs. EOS BOS The member opposite may not be aware, but because of that economic action plan Canada is leading the advanced economies, and because of that economic action plan this Minister of Finance was named the best minister of finance in the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board seems incapable of standing in this House and explaining his $50 million pork spree in Muskoka. EOS BOS It is so bad that he has friend, the foreign affairs minister claiming that the Muskoka gravy train was developed by public servants. EOS BOS It is simply not true. EOS BOS The Auditor General's report is clear, and I will quote: Senior officials said “their input had not been sought”.This deal was cooked up by the member from Muskoka. EOS BOS Public servants were deliberately frozen out. EOS BOS When will the minister take responsibility for his abuse of public trust? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, just because the member opposite says something does not mean it is true. EOS BOS Here is what we did. EOS BOS We supported investments to help Canada host the G8 with infrastructure, resurfacing the runway of an airport, resurfacing a provincial highway, and building the G8 centre which is now a community centre. EOS BOS Each of those projects was approved by the minister of infrastructure of the day. EOS BOS Each of those projects came in fully on budget. EOS BOS For each of those projects, there is a full contribution agreement that was negotiated with the municipality. EOS BOS These are all good projects. EOS BOS The Auditor General gave some advice on better transparency and better clarity and we fully accepted that counsel. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are a number of disturbing elements to this scandal. EOS BOS First, of course, is the minister's flagrant abuse of the public trust. EOS BOS Second, now that he has been caught, is the way he hides behind the foreign affairs minister. EOS BOS Given the sheer scale of this dubious spending and the fact that he is in Treasury Board, how can we trust this minister? EOS BOS It is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. EOS BOS Where is the accountability? EOS BOS Where is the transparency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would say to the member for Timmins—James Bay that we should give him a pass on the civility for that question, because it was quite funny. EOS BOS Here is the reality. EOS BOS We supported 32 public infrastructure projects. EOS BOS Each of them had a negotiated contribution agreement with the local municipality. EOS BOS The Auditor General has come forward and given us counsel and advice on what we might do better on the intake process for public infrastructure projects and on reporting to Parliament where there could be greater clarity and greater transparency. EOS BOS We thank the Auditor General for her work and fully accept her recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am listening but I am not hearing accountability. EOS BOS I am hearing bafflegab. EOS BOS Since the member from Muskoka cannot stand up and defend his actions, I will turn to his friend and I will ask him why he allowed the minister to cook up this deal to bypass all the checks and balances? Why did he allow $50 million in border infrastructure to be divvied up by the three amigos, the mayor, the minister and the hotel manager?Since the member from Muskoka will not apologize to this House, will his friend take responsibility and apologize to the Canadian people for his partner's misuse of public funds? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as to the three individuals the member mentioned, none of these three individuals approved a single project. EOS BOS All of the projects were approved by the minister of infrastructure, by me. EOS BOS All 32 projects are public infrastructure projects, things like paving provincial highways, constructing a new runway and a community centre. EOS BOS We used the existing authorities under the border infrastructure fund. EOS BOS The Auditor General has made advice and counsel that we could be more open and more transparent in terms of Parliament. EOS BOS We fully accept the Auditor General's advice and thank her for her good work. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the employees at the marine communications and traffic services centre know their jobs and the government should listen to them. EOS BOS However, our regional minister recently insulted them as he rubbed cake in their faces and then ran out the back door. EOS BOS The Coast Guard continues to be gutted. EOS BOS First it was about closing the marine sub-centre. EOS BOS Now we find out that the government has given the order to cut key positions in marine communications and traffic services. EOS BOS The employees have confirmed these cuts and are very concerned that they will drastically affect their ability to keep mariners safe. EOS BOS Let us be clear: these employees listen for the mayday calls. EOS BOS Why would the government compromise this important service? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, as usual the member opposite is entirely wrong. EOS BOS The efficiencies being gained at the sub-centre are strictly a working of the overtime situation, allowing better usage of overtime, with principles that have been used in both Victoria and Quebec for some 10 years now. EOS BOS We are simply nationalizing that as a policy to save money and still protect mariners. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a number of airlines have cancelled their contracts with the fuel supplier at the Montreal and Toronto airports. EOS BOS The dismantling of this consortium is putting 300 good jobs in jeopardy. EOS BOS The union representing those 300 workers has filed a complaint of unfair labour practices. EOS BOS The board needs time to come to a decision before the consortium is dismantled. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives facilitate an agreement between the parties in order to avoid a labour dispute? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member and EOS BOS will confer with the Minister of Labour on the matter with respect to airlines and regulation labour situations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us try again, because we have hundreds of jobs at risk here. EOS BOS Air Canada and other airlines have walked away from long-term contracts for aviation fuel services in Montreal and Toronto, resulting in the mass termination of more than 300 workers. EOS BOS The Canada Industrial Relations Board is now looking into multiple complaints of unfair labour practices. EOS BOS Again, will the Conservatives work with the companies and the workers to find a resolution, and will they halt the shutdown until the board has finished its investigation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I think the member knows, the Canada Industrial Relations Board is an independent body and will make its decision in due time. EOS BOS What we are doing at the labour program, though, with our mediators and facilitators, is continuing to work with both parties to make sure they come to a resolution of their issues. EOS BOS We know that, when parties work together, they come up with the best solutions for their workplaces, and we intend to help them get to a good solution. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in an email to the Conservatives about his plans to strip Muslim women of their right to wear the niqab at citizenship ceremonies, the immigration minister got the basic facts wrong. EOS BOS In a cynical political ploy, the government, he said, will appeal a court decision “allowing people to wear the hijab while taking the oath”. EOS BOS Surely the minister, of all people, ought to know the difference between a niqab and a hijab. EOS BOS As the Conservatives seek to restrict the rights of Muslim women, can they not at least pay them the courtesy of getting the facts right? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member may not have had the honour of living in a majority Muslim country where the hijab has been used to cover the face of women just as the niqab has been used and just as the burka has been used under the terrible influence of the Taliban in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. EOS BOS Those practices have no place in our citizenship ceremonies, where we insist on confirming the identity and confirming the commitment of new citizens to our laws, to our sovereign, to our values, and to our traditions.

BOS Mr. Speaker, seasonal industries contribute $78 billion to our economy, yet the government treats seasonal workers as second class citizens. EOS BOS The minister has now eliminated five weeks of EI payments to those workers. EOS BOS This change will affect tens of thousands of Canadians, reducing many to poverty; yet not a minute of study, no economic analysis, no consultation and no discussion at committee. EOS BOS Why is the government stealing five weeks of income from seasonal workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as usual, the hon. EOS BOS member has his facts all wrong. EOS BOS This temporary additional five weeks was a pilot program. EOS BOS It was brought in in the past. EOS BOS It was reintroduced and extended during the worst of the recession in 2008. EOS BOS It was extended again in 2010 because we recognized it would take people longer than usual to find work. EOS BOS Fortunately, we have seen a major resurgence in job creation in the country. EOS BOS Over 820,000 new jobs have been created. EOS BOS This program has come to its natural end. EOS BOS That was foretold two years ago because, frankly, we are creating jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on electoral reform the Liberals keep claiming that they are listening to Canadians but three-quarters of Canadians want a referendum on any changes to their system of democracy. EOS BOS It seems that Canadians have already spoken. EOS BOS Will the Liberals drop the lip service and listen to Canadians and hold a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have spoken. EOS BOS Over 60% spoke, voting for parties that said we need to modernize our electoral system. EOS BOS Canadians stood up in the last election and said they needed a system that would better reflect their will, that would better enfranchise their vote, and that would give them a better voice in our democratic process. EOS BOS We are committed to exactly that EOS BOS . 
               I would encourage the member opposite to work with us in this process. EOS BOS Let us improve our democracy. EOS BOS Let us get it done. EOS
BOS No, Mr. Speaker, Canadians have spoken. EOS BOS Seventy-five per cent of them want a referendum. EOS BOS The Minister of Democratic Institutions claims that a referendum is not the best way to consult Canadians but at the same time the minister is speaking out of the other side of her mouth by saying that she is listening to all Canadians. EOS BOS How better to know that one has the broad-based support of all Canadians than with a referendum? EOS BOS Will the Liberals stop pulling the wool over Canadians' eyes and hold a referendum, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, public consultation comes in many forms. EOS BOS The ability to engage Canadians happens in many different ways. EOS BOS We are absolutely committed to making sure that all Canadians' voices are heard in this process. EOS BOS What we want to do right now, and I would encourage the member to join us in the process, is to have a discussion on exactly how we are going to do it. EOS BOS Right now, I do not even know what the member would want a question on. EOS BOS It is important to posit ideas, to have a debate and a discussion about how we can improve our system and once we get to that point let us look at the next steps. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the parliamentary secretary that his government was elected by 39% of voters, not 60% as he has been saying. EOS BOS For the past few weeks, the Minister of Democratic Institutions has repeatedly stated that the referendum option is not on the table. EOS BOS This despite the fact that 73% of Canadians are in favour of a referendum. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Democratic Institutions and her government finally listen to Canadians and hold a referendum on the electoral system; #referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were not the only party to campaign on the idea of changing our electoral system, on modernizing our electoral and democratic institutions. EOS BOS The NDP did. EOS BOS The Green Party did. EOS BOS There were many different parties that posited this idea and in cumulative total that reaches more than 60%. EOS BOS The bigger point here is that there is a historic opportunity to improve the way Canadians interact with their democracy, to empower them and give them a chance to have a stronger voice in this process EOS BOS . I would encourage the member to work with us in that process, to begin that process of debate and ideas. EOS BOS Let us start it right now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister made it abundantly clear that the 2015 election would be the last to employ the first-past-the-post system and that the status quo is not an option. EOS BOS However, during the Liberal convention this weekend, the Minister of Democratic Institutions indicated that the government would not proceed with changes without the support of the people. EOS BOS Will the minister commit to holding a referendum on a subject as important as the electoral system to find out whether there is public support? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, from the onset we have been committed to engaging Canadians to ensure that any proposal we bring forward has broad support from the Canadian public. EOS BOS Let us remember the objective we are trying to achieve here. EOS BOS The objective we are trying to achieve is to enfranchise voters, to give them more power, more say, a better spot at the table in our Canadian democratic system. EOS BOS I would offer to members opposite who clearly are engaged in this issue, who clearly want to have a discussion about it, let us talk, let us have an opportunity to look at what the options are to improve our system and get to work on it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, maybe the parliamentary secretary could sort out some of the confusion left by his minister this weekend when she contradicted herself by saying on the one hand, “ EOS BOS I haven't been persuaded that referendum alone is the best tool that we can use in the 21st century”, but on the other hand she said, “And we will not proceed with any changes [to how Canadians vote] without the broad buy-in of the people of this country”. EOS BOS How do we get a broad buy-in if we do not actually consult broadly? EOS BOS How do we do this without having a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, to get broad buy-in we have to do what frankly has not occurred in the past, which is to reach out to Canadians in ridings across the country, to have real and genuine conversations around how to improve our democratic institutions, to take this historic opportunity to move our democracy to a new place where we empower voters to have a stronger say in our system. EOS BOS In order to do that we have to talk about options and dialogue and something other than the status quo. EOS BOS That is what I have not heard from members opposite. EOS BOS I have not heard them positing ideas on how we can improve our system. EOS BOS I would like them to please start participating in this debate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at some point the Liberals are actually going to have to come forward with some new proposal instead of suggesting everyone else should do it. EOS BOS When they do that we want to have a referendum. EOS BOS It is not just we who want a referendum, 73% of Canadians want a referendum. EOS BOS Sooner or later, there will be a proposal from the Liberals saying, “ EOS BOS Here is the new electoral system we suggest”. EOS BOS When that happens, will there be a referendum, as 73% of Canadians want, or will they deny Canadians their democratic say? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I realize this may not be something the member has seen a lot of, and we need to see a lot more of, which is the ideas brought forward by government are informed by not only broad-based consultations with the public but also all parties in the House. EOS BOS It is certainly our desire in this process to have each of the parties participating and helping form the modernization of our electoral system. EOS BOS To get to the point where we have something to talk about we need them to engage in that dialogue, bring forward their ideas, and move away from just hanging on to the status quo. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government wants to change the electoral system, but it does not really know how to change it, so it is making things up as it goes along. EOS BOS Nobody knows how long this will take. EOS BOS All we know is that the key players are a bunch of confused Liberals. EOS BOS The minister says she does not want to change anything unless she has broad public buy-in. EOS BOS She obviously has no idea where she wants to go with this. EOS BOS It is hard to have faith in the process when the Liberals have been dragging their feet for seven months and have stacked their committee with Liberals. EOS BOS Will the government fix things by changing the committee membership so that no political party has a majority? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is true that we do not know where this process is going to conclude. EOS BOS The party opposite may already have an idea of where it is going to go, but we want to actually engage in a meaningful dialogue that finds middle ground and the best solution. EOS BOS I imagine that solution should and must evolve as the dialogue and input from Canadians take place. EOS BOS If we simply step forward and say that this is the system we want, here it is, and we put it to a vote, frankly, that is how things were done, but that is not how things should be done. We need to work in an inclusive manner and work together to find the best system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if that were the case we would have to ask why Liberals stacked Liberal members on the committee picking the new voting system. EOS BOS Details matter, and Liberals have proposed a system in which Liberals could unilaterally change our voting system. EOS BOS On the weekend, the minister said she is looking forward to, and I quote “broad support”. EOS BOS Two-thirds of the House were elected on a promise of electoral reform. EOS BOS Some have accused the minister of damaging the credibility of the process with her platitudes and vague answers to straightforward questions. EOS BOS Therefore, we implore the Liberals to answer this one simple question. EOS BOS Are the Liberals actually willing to go it alone and unilaterally change our voting system, or will they require the support of at least one recognized party in the House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have had many occasions to talk and work with the member opposite. I know that he is very earnest in his desire to improve our electoral system. I know that he has many ideas he wants to bring forward to the process EOS BOS . EOS BOS Let me tell him that in this process certainly each and every one of us is going to be given the opportunity to vote on that system. EOS BOS Each and every one of us is going to be given an opportunity to give input to it. EOS BOS Each and every one of us has a responsibility to engage our constituents and Canadians, on a pan-Canadian basis, to make sure their voices are heard. EOS BOS I look forward to working with him on it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year, Canada was shocked to learn of the case of Shaima Jastaina, a Saudi citizen who was arrested for the simple act of driving a car. EOS BOS Saudi Arabia remains the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive, a routine act for most women in any democracy. EOS BOS Today we have been informed that the 10 lashes sentence received by Ms. Jastaina has been dropped. EOS BOS Would the parliamentary secretary please update this House on Canada's reaction to these latest developments? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are extremely pleased by reports that Shaima Jastaina's sentence has been dropped. EOS BOS From the outset, Canada has fully supported the cause of Saudi women. EOS BOS In fact, during his trip to Saudi Arabia in March of this year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs raised this important issue with the Saudi foreign minister and the president of the Human Rights Commission. EOS BOS We continue to call on Saudi authorities to review their position on the driving ban and implement the necessary reforms to ensure equality among all their citizens. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of the Environment seemed keen for us to know that she comes from the community of Gjoa Haven, but according to NASA and National Geographic, if polar ice melts continue as predicted, her community and vast stretches of the Arctic Ocean will be under water. EOS BOS Since she seems to be indifferent to the fate of the rest of us, has she at least convened a community meeting in her own community to discuss adaptation and mitigation measures before this dramatic rise in sea level? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is taking a leadership role in international climate change efforts. EOS BOS We have been clear that any international agreements must be fair and effective. EOS BOS That includes all commitments by all major emitters. EOS BOS Meanwhile, we have taken real actions domestically, and we are seeing progress. EOS BOS Thanks to our actions, carbon emissions will go down by close to 130 megatonnes from what they would have been under the Liberals, and we have done that without introducing a carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada welcomes those who work hard and play by the rules. EOS BOS However, this does not include those who seek to take advantage of our generosity. EOS BOS Human smuggling is dangerous and preys upon the most vulnerable groups so terrorist organizations such as the Tamil Tigers can make a profit. EOS BOS Recently, the Prime Minister made an important announcement to protect our country, our communities and our citizens from human smuggling. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please update the House on these important safety measures? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am happy to inform the member that our government has provided significant support to Thailand to help combat the scourge of human smuggling. EOS BOS Through the anti-crime capacity building program, we will help Thailand to stop being used as a conduit for human smuggling by criminals and terrorists. EOS BOS This builds upon the important measures in the protecting Canada's immigration system act. EOS BOS Our message is clear to criminals and terrorists considering human smuggling operations: do not do it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the main obstacle for peace and stability in Syria remains the Assad regime and its backers who persist in killing Syrian civilians. EOS BOS Canada's position has not changed. EOS BOS Assad must go. EOS BOS The aspirations of the Syrian people to live in peace must be met. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Public Safety please give the House an update on the actions the Government of Canada is taking to ensure that no one removed from Canada faces an undue risk of death or torture at the hands of the Assad regime? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, due to the conditions in Syria at the hands of the dictatorial regime, the Canada Border Services Agency placed an administrative deferral of removal on Syria on March 15. EOS BOS That means we will not be removing anyone to Syria unless the individual is a danger to Canadian society. EOS BOS Canadians can rest assured that our government will continue to enforce the law and ensure that our streets and communities are safe from foreign criminals and terrorists, even those from Syria. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for a number of years, the current government has promised the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador parity with the rest of Atlantic Canada when it comes to the food fishery. EOS BOS Still, we have one set of rules for the Maritimes and a different set of rules for Newfoundland and Labrador. EOS BOS The minister promised to look at all of the options last July, but still there has been no change. EOS BOS When will the government stop treating the residents of my riding and my province like second-class citizens and extend them the same rights to catch fish for food as fishers in her own province? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we certainly understand how important the food fishery is to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. EOS BOS That is why we are looking into the matter to see if there is any way we can extend the food fishery so that people will be able to go and get their food for the winter. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the House is currently debating government legislation that would increase the mandate of Canada's spy agency, giving CSIS broader powers of surveillance over Canadians. EOS BOS However, the Security Intelligence Review Committee, suffering from two vacancies and without a full-time chair, is already falling behind in its investigations of complaints against the agency. EOS BOS Even former chair Chuck Strahl stated that it might be necessary to review the role of SIRC, its resources, or both. EOS BOS Does the government not believe that national security should be properly balanced with effective oversight and respect for the privacy of law-abiding Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the role of the Security Intelligence Review Committee is to report to Parliament and confirm that this agency is fulfilling its mandate in accordance with the law. EOS BOS That is precisely the purpose of Bill C-44, which we are currently debating and which will clarify the powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in order to make judges' work easier and also to facilitate the work of the review committee, which does an excellent job. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government continues to allow the rail industry to regulate itself. EOS BOS How can we trust this government when the Transportation Safety Board believes that it has proven incapable of monitoring the industry?Recently, we learned that 254 accidents were not reported, and all the minister is doing is saying that she is not happy. EOS BOS Will the minister finally increase the number of inspectors and impose heavy fines on the offending companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, indeed, we have already increased the number of inspectors in this country. EOS BOS We put $100 million into this file. EOS BOS More importantly, we continue to work on the rail safety measures because we want to ensure that we have a transportation system that works. EOS BOS The unfortunate incident in Lac-Mégantic was due to the fact that somebody did not follow the rules. EOS BOS We have rules in place for a reason. EOS BOS They are being prosecuted under the fullest extent of the law, and that is the appropriate way to deal with it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is how it is. The minister continues to make promises, but nothing concrete has been done since the Lac-Mégantic disaster that would instill confidence in Canadians. EOS BOS Hundreds of accidents are not being reported and safety plans are not carefully followed. EOS BOS Despite all this, the minister refuses to take action. EOS BOS Why does the minister not immediately start imposing heavy fines on the offending companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have issued numerous emergency directives. EOS BOS We have also included ministerial orders to ensure that we have the safest system that we can in Canada. EOS BOS We have also invested in rail safety, increasing the budgets for rail safety year after year to ensure that they have the resources they need at Transport Canada to do the work that we expect them to do, and they will continue to do that work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is missing the point and failing to address the heart of the matter. EOS BOS In 2009 there was one inspector for every 14 tank cars of oil. EOS BOS Only five years later, there is one inspector for every 4,000. EOS BOS The situation, we know, is getting increasingly dangerous. EOS BOS Here we have the minister standing in front of Canadians today, telling them she plans to audit the problem away. EOS BOS Can the minister see why Canadians will not rest easy with that response? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality in this country is that there are 46,000 kilometres of track. EOS BOS Over 20 years ago it was recognized that in order to properly deal with the risks and inspections, we would create something called the safety management system. EOS BOS It is world renowned. EOS BOS It is state of the art. EOS BOS That is what we utilize here in Canada. EOS BOS The Transportation Safety Board has clearly said that it is the way to go. EOS BOS That is what countries do around the world when they are dealing effectively both with inspections and with audit of safety culture in railways. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, another primary responsibility of any government is to ensure that the food Canadians put on their tables is safe. EOS BOS The Conservatives have failed in that as well. EOS BOS They were responsible for the largest meat recall in Canadian history. EOS BOS According to the Auditor General, the government failed to properly protect and inform the public. EOS BOS What is the Prime Minister going to do to address the government's systemic failure to keep Canadians' food supply safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that just does not accurately represent what the Auditor General found overall. EOS BOS In fact, the Consumers' Association of Canada stated, “ EOS BOS The Government's enhanced recall warnings will provide consumers with better information regarding steps they should take during food recalls”. EOS BOS It has been noted we brought in tougher penalties, enhanced controls on E. coli, new meat labelling requirements, and more than 750 new inspectors, and, by the way, as we have done those things and made those investments, the NDP has voted against them every step of the way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they cut $26 million from food inspection. EOS BOS That is their real record. EOS BOS One of the problems the Auditor General points to is that every time he prepares a report, the government claims it will accept his recommendations, but then turns around and ignores them. EOS BOS When it comes to protecting the public, whether we are talking about rail safety or food safety, will the government finally listen and take action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government always acts on the recommendations of any auditor general. EOS BOS That is why our government has invested more in the food safety system. EOS BOS Our government will continue to make the necessary investments to ensure that our system remains a world-class system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's strong support for the arts is very important to my constituents and all Canadians. EOS BOS What steps is the government putting in place in order to provide Canada's cultural innovators with opportunities to work and collaborate with one another in order to further their art and create economic opportunities together? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for Toronto— EOS BOS Danforth for her continued advocacy and support on behalf of the arts in her riding and around the country. EOS BOS Our government is committed to the arts. EOS BOS We are committed to supporting creative labs and to bringing artisan creators together to work and grow. EOS BOS That is why we have invested $5.25 million in the Artscape Daniels Launchpad to give creators and entrepreneurs access to spaces, tools, and technology, plus the skills and opportunities needed to innovate and thrive in today's creative economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we keep getting told in this chamber that nothing has changed, and people are still eligible for their disability tax credit. EOS BOS However, we receive calls every day at our constituency offices about new rules that are rendering people living with type 1 diabetes, autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and developmental disorders ineligible for the disability tax credit, despite having receiving it for years. EOS BOS Families are desperate for help. EOS BOS When will the government stop making excuses and fix this problem? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no changes have been made to the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit or the tax credit for people with diabetes. EOS BOS For 10 years, the previous Conservative government made cuts to scientific research. EOS BOS Last year, our government invested $41 million in research into diabetes and $5 billion into mental health services for more than 500,000 young Canadians under 25. EOS BOS We are making this credit more accessible. EOS BOS We have simplified the forms and are allowing specialized nurse practitioners to fill out the forms if the applicants do not have a doctor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, getting through to a real person at the CRA is notoriously difficult, unless of course someone is a personal friend and fundraiser for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS In that case, he just picks up the phone for them. EOS BOS The Auditor General reports that 64% of calls were blocked, given the busy signal, or told to call back and disconnected. EOS BOS The government is raising taxes on diabetics, small businesses, and middle-class families, and it will not even pick up the phone to answer questions. EOS BOS Why does the government only answer questions for wealthy Liberal insiders and hang up on everyone else? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have an action plan for improving the quality of services the agency provides to Canadians. EOS BOS We have no lessons to learn from the Conservatives, who chose to make cuts to the call centres year after year. EOS BOS While the number of calls were increasing, they reduced the number of agents at the centres, the opening hours, and the standards of service. EOS BOS Instead of making cuts, we have chosen to make investments. EOS BOS We will continue to take tangible measures to provide Canadians with the best service. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance is unfairly adding to Canadian entrepreneurs' tax burden. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance is telling our disappointed entrepreneurs to call him, but the Auditor General indicated that more than 29 million Canadian entrepreneurs did not have their calls returned. EOS BOS That represents almost half of the people who called the minister. EOS BOS I want to ask the Minister of Finance a simple question: when will he pick up the phone and answer the calls of concerned entrepreneurs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will repeat that I agree with all of the Auditor General's recommendations. EOS BOS The former Conservative government decided to cut services, cut staff, and to cut the evaluation of the quality of services. EOS BOS That happened under former national revenue minister, Ms. Findlay. EOS BOS Instead of making cuts, we have chosen to reinvest $50 million over the next four years. EOS BOS We are taking real action to ensure that Canadians have the services they are entitled to expect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in indicating on Friday that the government was doing a complete reversal of its previous position at the Ashley Smith inquest, the government did not tell us what exactly has changed in the government's position. EOS BOS There have now been a number of reports from the correctional investigator, indicating that the Ashley Smith death was not alone, was not a singular act, and in fact there are dozens of people who have died while in custody and who have committed suicide. EOS BOS I would like to ask the government: EOS BOS Can it please explain to the House what exactly has changed over the last few days that has caused the government to change its position at the coroner's inquest? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this tragedy continues to show that individuals with mental health issues do not belong in prison but in professional facilities. EOS BOS At the same time, our government continues to take concrete steps on the issue of mental health in prison. EOS BOS We have taken action to improve access to mental health treatment and training of staff. EOS BOS Some of the behaviour by the correctional service seen in these videos is absolutely unacceptable, and that is why the government has directed the Correctional Service of Canada to fully co-operate on this issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has had access to the videos in question for five years. EOS BOS The government has been well aware of the situation for five years. EOS BOS It was only on Friday that the Conservatives admitted that the videos contained something unacceptable, despite the fact that they have been aware of the problem since they came to power and certainly since the death of Ms. Smith. EOS BOS What really changed? EOS BOS The government is guilty of a certain amount of hypocrisy. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is clear to anyone viewing these videos that the behaviour by some officials at the Correctional Service of Canada is absolutely unacceptable. EOS BOS That is why the government has directed the Correctional Service of Canada to be fully supportive of this investigation. EOS
BOS Let us be clear, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS There is not a correctional minister or a senior official at the Correctional Service of Canada who has not had access to those videos. EOS BOS It was entirely possible for them to view those videos for five years. EOS BOS In fact, they must have seen the videos, because for such a long time they told the inquest and everybody that the videos could not be shown because they were so serious. EOS BOS Now Canadians have seen them and now we understand what the problem is. EOS BOS I would like to ask the government, how can it justify this level of inaction over five years in which the correctional investigator has said that the situation is unacceptable? EOS </s> BOS This is a tragedy, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS It shows that more could be done on mental health. EOS BOS That is why since 2006, we have ensured that there is faster mental health screening, that there has been extended mental and psychological counselling. EOS BOS We have ensured that no prison cells contain harmful objects, and we have had improved staff training. EOS BOS Obviously we are all deeply troubled by what these videos have shown, and that is why the government has directed the Correctional Service of Canada to fully co-operate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today, after consulting with workers across the country, I am tabling a private member's bill to protect the pensions of workers. EOS BOS Currently Canada's bankruptcy laws do not protect workers' pensions and benefits. EOS BOS The Prime Minister knows this, which is why he promised workers in my hometown that he would improve retirement security for Canadians. EOS BOS However, he has so far refused to fix the rules that let companies shortchange workers' pension plans. EOS BOS Workers fulfill their obligations, and companies and the Liberal government must do the same. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister keep his promise and work with me to protect our pensioners, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government supports secure pensions. EOS BOS More importantly, we understand workers and their families and the dedication and commitment they make to various companies. EOS BOS It is important that we work with them. EOS BOS With respect to the CCAA process, that process is designed to help companies in financial distress, so that they can restructure their affairs in order to come out of that restructuring process to help, preserve, and create thousands of jobs. EOS BOS With respect to Sears, the current issue at hand, we are working with Sears Canada employees across the country, and Service Canada, in order to provide assistance and support to the workers and their families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as RCMP contract talks resume this week, Conservatives continue to bring more threats than ideas to the negotiating table. EOS BOS The province and municipalities have said they are ready to negotiate in good faith in order to keep B.C. families safe. EOS BOS They are asking the government to be serious and constructive. EOS BOS When will the minister stop using the public safety of British Columbians as a bargaining chip? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the solicitor general of British Columbia forwarded some of her concerns that she indicated that she would provide to me in September. EOS BOS I understand officials are sitting down and working together with British Columbia officials. EOS BOS I understand, at the same time, that some of the municipalities that are looking at moving from municipal police forces to the RCMP would like this settled. I would urge the British Columbia government to look at the proposals that we have on the table. EOS BOS We will look at what it presented and come to a fair conclusion. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with weeks left it shows how out of touch Conservatives are with reality. EOS BOS Conservatives are asking British Columbians to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to the federal government for rejecting its unfair HST and now Conservatives are threatening to pull the police off our streets. EOS BOS The province and municipalities are ready and willing to talk, so when will the government stop playing games with our public safety and start listening to British Columbians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member did not hear the answer. EOS BOS Officials are sitting down to look over the proposals that the solicitor general from British Columbia finally forwarded to the federal officials. EOS BOS I thank her for sending those proposals to us. EOS BOS I would urge the officials to work out the bugs that remain in this contract and get to ensuring that we have an appropriate RCMP contract in place. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is constantly bragging about its law and order agenda, but it is threatening to pull the RCMP off British Columbia streets if it does not agree to a new labour contract by the end of November. EOS BOS Fortunately, negotiations will resume this week. EOS BOS British Columbia families are wondering whether the Conservatives will start working in their best interests and in the interests of their safety, or if the Conservatives will continue to threaten to pull police officers off the streets. EOS BOS British Columbia is prepared to negotiate in good faith. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives prepared to do the same? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I provided the answer and I do not know if the individual heard me EOS BOS . I would like to quote the Canadian Police Association, which members opposite should take to heart. EOS BOS It said:We're quite satisfied with the efforts this government has made to work on behalf of front-line police officers, specifically with respect to the comprehensive justice legislation that has been a priority since the last election. EOS BOS We would ask the NDP members to get off of their high horse and actually do things that make a difference to front line police officers and the citizens they serve. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the economy of smaller towns and regions is also suffering under the Conservatives. EOS BOS Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation was replaced by ACOA. EOS BOS However, whatever it is called, the bottom line is clear—the Conservatives have failed to deliver the help that this region needs to build its economy. EOS BOS ECBC was shut down in the omnibus budget bill last year, but according to the mayor of Port Hawkesbury, “ACOA has failed us miserably...”. EOS BOS Why has the minister not been talking to the mayors about the problems with ACOA? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the hon. member travel to Cape Breton and get around a little more, because our government is committed to supporting economic development in Cape Breton and throughout Atlantic Canada. EOS BOS In fact, just in the last year alone we have provided $2.2 million toward the implementation of the Richmond County tourism strategy, $1 million to assist with the operation of the Celtic Colours International Festival, $1.3 million for the expansion of the Sydney boardwalk, $200,000 for the Inverness County Trails Federation in an effort to make the Inverness portion of the Trans-Canada trail, and $105,000 to support Synergy Louisbourg. EOS BOS I could go on and on, if the member has a supplemental question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's promised Arctic naval base at Nanisivik has been downgraded to a fuel cache and an unheated shed. EOS BOS In 2006, the Prime Minister promised to build a deepwater port at Iqaluit that could be used by the military. EOS BOS This would be vital infrastructure that could help the people of the Arctic reduce their costs and build a prosperous territory. EOS BOS Instead of photo ops and empty rhetoric, the government should have focused on getting the job done for northerners. EOS BOS When is the government going to realize that the best way to protect the Arctic is by helping the people who call it home? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's north is central to our government's vision for Canada and the future. EOS BOS We continue to develop the Nanisivik station to serve as a docking and refuelling station for the Royal Canadian Navy and other government vessels operating in the north. EOS BOS Through our northern strategy, our government continues to increase Canada's presence and sovereignty in the Arctic. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while this Prime Minister is being paid to dig us deeper into debt and to go sunbathing with his family on the taxpayers’ dime, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is out in the cold launching the celebrations for the 150th anniversary of Confederation. EOS BOS Like the Prime Minister, she is favouring her Liberal cronies. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister, who has once again increased the tax burden of Canadians, justify spending $127,000 on a vacation paid for by taxpayers, who will be paying back his deficit for decades to come? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the vision we have put in place for the Canada 150 celebrations. EOS BOS Four themes will be celebrated throughout the year: young people, the environment, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, and diversity and inclusiveness. EOS BOS We will make sure that in funding the celebrations and various projects across the country, there will be an equitable regional distribution. EOS BOS Of course, I hope all Canadians across the country and of all political stripes will join in the celebrations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has lost touch with average Canadians. EOS BOS I can imagine it is easy to miss the challenges that everyday Canadians are facing when he is busy jet-setting to billionaire island, but $127,000. EOS BOS Even the most out-of-touch Hollywood celebrity would blush at this type of spending, and 17 hundred bucks to feed a family of five on a three hour flight. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister think taxpayers should be on the hook for this type of extravagance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians elected our government on a plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class. EOS BOS We are delivering on that commitment. EOS BOS Over the last seven months, almost 250,000 jobs were created, the majority of which were full-time jobs. EOS BOS This is the most job growth we have seen in over a decade. EOS BOS This is evidence that our plan is working. EOS BOS Yesterday, we continued to build off those investments, good work we are doing for Canadians. EOS BOS One of the first things we did after taking office was to ask the Clerk of the Privy Council Office to develop guidelines surrounding the reimbursement of travel by sitting prime ministers, their families, and guests. EOS BOS Prior to our government taking office, no such policy existed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is the first time the PCO has needed private island guidelines. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has increased taxes on Canadians who use Uber or public transit to get to work, because the Prime Minister has made it very clear he needs the extra cash to pay for his caviar and champagne when he travels to private islands. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is so out of touch that he is raising taxes on struggling Canadians to fund his lavish lifestyle, and Canadians are getting fed up. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister actually stand and answer questions of behalf of struggling Canadians or will he just sit there with a smug look on his face, while he daydreams about his next vacation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government and Prime Minister held unprecedented levels of public consultation so we could actually respond to the very real challenges they face. EOS BOS It was this government that lowered taxes on middle-class Canadians by increasing taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Canadians. EOS BOS It was this government that introduced the Canada child benefit to give more money to families with children who needed it the most so they could actually do what they needed to do for their families. EOS BOS What was consistent throughout it all? EOS BOS The Conservatives voted against it every time. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, hazardous material is transported daily by rail throughout my riding. EOS BOS By not ensuring the highest safety standards for rail, Conservatives have left communities to fend for themselves. EOS BOS In Toronto, community members have formed a safe rail communities group. EOS BOS They are calling for greater transparency in rail safety decisions. EOS BOS Why has the minister dropped the ball on this file and left it up to Canadians to do her job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is utter nonsense. EOS BOS This government has taken significant actions with respect to improving rail safety, many of those measures, by the way, opposed by New Democrats opposite. EOS BOS We have worked with our partners, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, with the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs, and with a number of stakeholders to improve information sharing with municipalities, for example. EOS BOS We are taking action, not rhetoric, unlike the opposition. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, I remind the House that it was not military and RCMP veterans and their families who put the country into deficit. EOS BOS Yet the government plans to cut 1,800 jobs from the Department of Veterans Affairs, thus cutting actual services for our brave heroes in this country. EOS BOS So will the government put a prophylactic barrier around the Treasury Board to stop doing to DVA what it is about to do to our pensioners and our seniors in this country? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, our government has been very clear: under no circumstances are we making cuts to veterans. EOS BOS We are maintaining all benefits to veterans. EOS BOS We will ensure that veterans receive services when they need them, and we are going to look for ways to improve delivery of services to our veterans by cutting red tape. EOS BOS We recognize the great work done by our officials at Veterans Affairs and we know that Charlottetown is a key component of their work. EOS BOS It is expected that many of the changes the member is noting will be achieved mostly as a result of employees retiring over the next five years. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Conservatives plan to cut 500 jobs at Veterans Affairs, and with the transfer of Ste. EOS BOS Anne's Hospital to the Government of Quebec, 1,800 jobs will be lost. EOS BOS Great Britain and the United States have chosen not to reduce their deficits on the backs of their heroes, but that is what this government is planning on doing. EOS BOS Veterans are not the ones who have been mismanaging the budget for the past six years. EOS BOS This government is going to cut 40% of the staff at this department and it is promising to improve services for veterans. EOS BOS That is totally illogical. EOS BOS Can someone explain to me how this is going to work? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, our government will ensure that the veterans at Ste. EOS BOS Anne's Hospital continue to receive priority access to exceptional care and services. EOS BOS Under no circumstances whatsoever will our veterans' services be compromised. EOS BOS We will also protect the interests of the employees at Ste. EOS BOS Anne's Hospital, who have devoted their lives to providing exceptional care to our veterans. EOS BOS The transfer of Ste. EOS BOS Anne's Hospital aims to maintain their employment. EOS BOS Unlike the NDP, Conservatives believe Quebec can run a hospital. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, hundreds of Aveos workers are on Parliament Hill today, and they want the government to listen to what they have to say. EOS BOS They want Air Canada to keeps its aircraft maintenance operations in Montreal, as stipulated in the Air Canada Public Participation Act. EOS BOS This government, which makes a great show of championing law and order, is collaborating with this delinquent company and breaking its own law. EOS BOS By order in council, the Minister of Finance is responsible for enforcing the legislation. EOS BOS Will the minister stop hiding, start doing his job and compel Air Canada to obey the law? EOS BOS Will he stop being complicit in this financial sham? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I was saying earlier, we know that these job losses are devastating for the regions involved. EOS BOS The Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities will be calling witnesses and asking questions EOS BOS .  We have to keep in mind that we are talking about two private companies. EOS BOS We are not considering any plan to bail out Aveos and Air Canada. EOS BOS In the past few years, our government has invested $666 million in the aerospace industry in the Montreal region. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, people in my riding of Kitchener South—Hespeler in the Waterloo region are proud of our government's commitment to grow the economy, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class. EOS BOS They know that the smart investments our government is making will help more Canadians find and keep good, well-paying jobs. EOS BOS Can the minister update this House on what our government is doing to grow the economy and ensure every Canadian has a fair shot at success? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the investments we are making in child care, skilled trades, training, and infrastructure will put more Canadians on the path to success. EOS BOS Since our government first took office, the Canadian economy has created over half a million jobs. EOS BOS We have seen 11 consecutive months of job growth, the best in a decade. EOS BOS As Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter noted, September and October marked the highest two-month period of job growth on record. EOS BOS We ran on a plan to make smart investments to grow our economy and strengthen our middle class, and that plan is working. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, USW Local 1005 president Gary Howe said, “ EOS BOS Our members and our community don't trust U.S. Steel or this government to do what's best for workers and pensioners”, and it is easy to see why. EOS BOS Workers, Stelco retirees, and the City of Hamilton are in court yet again to force the Conservatives to reveal the contents of the secret deal they made with U.S. Steel. EOS BOS We all know that the Conservatives failed to stand up for the workers of Hamilton, but why are they still refusing to give them the details so that they can at least stand up for themselves? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is against the law for the Government of Canada to release this information without the consent of the company. EOS BOS It is up to the company to make this information public. EOS BOS Our government is the only government in Canadian history to take a company to court in order to ensure that it meets its Investment Canada commitments. EOS BOS A recent report by the Chamber of Commerce said that 13,000 new jobs will be created in Hamilton, driven primarily by the manufacturing sector, thanks to the great work of this Canadian government and this finance minister on the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when I go to visit my friends, I have never left with an invoice. EOS BOS However, that seems to be exactly what happened when the Prime Minister left billionaire island, but instead of paying the bill himself, he stuck it to the taxpayer. EOS BOS In what world does the Prime Minister live when he believes that it is acceptable to use taxpayers' money to repay hospitality expenses charged to him by his billionaire friends? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have answered in this House many times before, irrespective of where the Prime Minister travels, whether it is personal or business travel, he is given the necessary resources, just as has been the case for all previous prime ministers. EOS BOS This is the case. EOS BOS This is what it has been, and that is exactly what the answer is. EOS BOS I look forward to working with the member on doing the important work that Canadians elected us to do. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, after dragging his feet for over 18 months, the minister is finally going to announce a water management strategy for the oil sands. EOS BOS Canadians have a very hard time trusting the Conservatives when it comes to this file. EOS BOS We know that water contamination has been a problem for years now, but no measures have been taken so far. EOS BOS Can the government tell us if the water monitoring system will be completely independent and transparent? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, as my colleague opposite continues to lobby against 500,000 jobs in Canada's energy sector, we are taking real action to protect the sustainable development of Canada's natural resources. EOS BOS I would like to remind my colleague opposite of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development's testimony on this very subject in committee. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS What I would say is there is now an ambitious plan, a significantly important plan for the federal government to put in place a monitoring system”.Instead of her empty rhetoric and talking points, the member should get on board. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, my hon. EOS BOS colleague has not done her homework. EOS BOS Pollution from the oil sands is expected to triple by 2035. EOS BOS Instead of a voluntary approach that favours friends of the government, lobbyists and large corporations, we should be imposing strict limits on the pollution caused by the oil sands in order to protect the environment and the health of Canadians. EOS BOS Will the government protect the communities of millions of Canadians, or is it too busy chasing “foreign radicals”? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, when we talk about homework my colleague opposite should stop lobbying against the Canadian energy sector. EOS BOS What we are about to announce today, and I do not want to steal the minister's thunder, is a credible monitoring system where we will be working in lockstep with the provinces and with industry to come up with a world-class monitoring system. EOS BOS The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development said this “holds the promise of establishing a credible, robust and publicly accessible monitoring system for measuring environmental conditions and changes in environmental quality levels, as well as determining the source of changes”.We have a real plan with a real focus. EOS BOS The member should get on board. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the worst recession in a generation, eligibility for EI has hit a 10-year low, and for those who do qualify, service is falling. EOS BOS Two-thirds of EI calls and 50% of CPP calls are not being answered on time. EOS BOS Last week, the minister said that if there were a need, she would bring on more staff, but in reality she is getting rid of staff. EOS BOS Why will she not keep her promise, fix her department and give people the help they need? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the report continues to show that 8 out of 10 individuals in Canada qualify for employment insurance. EOS BOS Let us be very clear: This government is focused on making sure that those who are unemployed have an opportunity to have a job. EOS BOS We have created 820,000 net new jobs since the downturn of the recession. EOS BOS We have a number of items that we put forward, whether they be the targeted initiative for older workers or apprenticeship grants, or an opportunity for individuals to support the hiring credit for small businesses. EOS BOS These are all things that the opposition members vote against time and again. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' changes are not working. EOS BOS There are not enough staff to answer people's questions at peak periods. EOS BOS That is the problem. EOS BOS It is a perfect example of the Conservatives' mismanagement. EOS BOS The vast majority of calls about employment insurance and old age security are not being answered within the prescribed time limit. EOS BOS When will the minister stop cutting services to the public and start providing the necessary resources to get the job done? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Service Canada continues to improve and update its operations to ensure that Canadians receive service effectively, efficiently and, in the best case scenario, in a way that uses taxpayers' dollars effectively. EOS BOS Unlike the NDP, which wants to put in place a $21 billion carbon tax, increase taxes and therefore not provide opportunities for Canadians, we are focused on what Canadians need: efficient and effective service. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with one in five jobs in Canada dependent on exports, our government understands the importance of opening new markets. EOS BOS While the NDP and Liberals want to raise taxes and hurt jobs, we have launched the most ambitious pro-export plan in Canadian history. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade please advise the House as to what is next in Canada's pursuit of trade? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me first start by thanking the hard-working member for Chatham-Kent—Essex. EOS BOS Today the Minister of International Trade announced that he will lead a multi-sector trade mission to Israel, focused on supporting small and medium-sized businesses. EOS BOS Canada deeply values its close ties with Israel. EOS BOS As the Prime Minister highlighted during his state visit in 2014, Israel is an example to the world, a nation whose response to suffering has been to build an extraordinary society, a vibrant democracy, and an innovative, world-leading start-up nation. EOS BOS Our government is ambitious about what our countries can achieve together. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, in spite of the risks, the government blindly backs the northern gateway. EOS BOS It dismisses Canadians who raise real concerns about the effect on our fisheries, on our first nations and on our way of life. EOS BOS Yesterday, we learned that the pipeline would also raise oil prices for Canadians, hurting the bottom line of families and businesses throughout the economy. EOS BOS Why is the minister putting oil companies ahead of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, if members had been at committee yesterday they would have heard great testimony about the strength of the Canadian energy industry and the great future that we have ahead of us. EOS BOS The Minister of the Environment has referred the northern gateway pipeline to a joint review panel. EOS BOS That panel will hear everyone who has an interest in speaking to it. EOS BOS It will make a decision in the end. EOS BOS We are going to protect the environment and develop the energy industry across this country. EOS BOS We then expect to export our products around the world. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the government's only energy strategy is to boost the profits of oil companies at the expense of the rest of us. EOS BOS The government has sold out Canadian jobs and our environment to back the Enbridge northern gateway pipeline. EOS BOS The government is so cozy with big oil that it would not surprise me if it were to take it along to China. EOS BOS When the Prime Minister flies to China, is he bringing Canadians' interests or the CEO of Enbridge? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, we need to diversify our markets to move forward in Canada's economic future. EOS BOS Why can the NDP members not realize that?Mark Carney agrees. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS The Chinese market is a tremendous opportunity for Canada”. EOS BOS Why can the NDP members not realize that? EOS BOS Jack Mintz said that getting our oil to market would result in $131 billion for the Canadian economy. EOS BOS Why can the NDP members not stand behind that? EOS BOS Why will they not stand with us to protect Canadian jobs, protect the environment, protect the economy and let us move ahead? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first I would like to extend my thoughts and prayers to the people of Bay de Verde in light of yesterday's fire at the Quinlan Brothers fish processing facility. EOS BOS Our hearts are with the workers and the community today. EOS BOS The Newfoundland and Labrador throne speech confirmed what many in our home province have been worried about. EOS BOS The recent downturn in oil prices has decreased revenue at a time when unemployment is on the rise. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance provide an update to the House about what our government is doing to help the people of Newfoundland and Labrador during these difficult times? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Avalon, his caucus colleagues from Newfoundland and Labrador and the Minister of Public Services and Procurement for their tireless work on behalf of Newfoundland and Labrador. EOS BOS When that province came to us with a fiscal stabilization request, I directed the Department of Finance officials to move forward expeditiously on this request. EOS BOS I am pleased to say that we have moved forward with an advance payment of $32 million of fiscal stabilization for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in these difficult times. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Alberta is facing record high unemployment rates and families are struggling to get by. EOS BOS Yesterday, Statistics Canada released new EI numbers, and Alberta saw an astonishing increase in EI claims of 87% since July last year. EOS BOS I know the Liberals profess to make decisions based on facts, so I ask this. EOS BOS How much more proof do they need before they admit their disastrous policies are failing Albertans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of a government that is both sensitive and sensible. EOS BOS We are sensitive to the economic situation across Canada, in particular where a number of Canadians are feeling left out of the labour market. EOS BOS We are sensible because we are investing very strongly in our economy to build now and for the future of our nation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not know if he listened to my question because that obviously was not an answer. EOS BOS Families are losing their homes, companies are taking their businesses elsewhere, and skilled workers are being forced to line up at the EI counter. Rehearsed talking points are not the answer. EOS BOS The situation in Alberta is unique and we do not need more job-killing Liberal policies. EOS BOS When are the Liberals going to stop destroying the Alberta economy and allow Albertans to get back to work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to be part of a government that is investing both in the quality and the quantity of services delivered to unemployed Canadians across Canada. We have done that very significantly in the budget last year. EOS BOS We are very pleased that we are offering better services and better benefits targeted to both in terms of responding to the needs and to the expectations of Canadians, and with rebuilding our economy based on strong fiscal policy and very good infrastructure programs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to the Federal Court, three years ago someone used a Conservative database to tell voters their polling stations had moved to fictitious locations, but only one charge has been laid as a result. EOS BOS Elections Canada has not been able to compel witness testimony. EOS BOS Elections Canada says that the investigation has been hampered because the Conservatives will not give it the tools it needs to get witness co-operation. EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives not want to know who used their own database to commit electoral fraud? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the question was about the powers of the existing election commissioner. EOS BOS Let us clarify. EOS BOS First of all, he can compel testimony before the courts after charges are laid through something called a subpoena. EOS BOS He can compel documents by seeking a warrant from a judge, and all of his powers of investigation are the same as those of police officers investigating the most heinous of crimes. EOS BOS Furthermore, under the fair elections act he would have sharper teeth, a longer reach, and a freer hand, including total independence so that he can make his own decisions about investigations and staffing, and he will not be able to be fired without cause. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, aboriginal communities are among the most vulnerable in Canada when it comes to dealing with emergency situations like the one in Attawapiskat. EOS BOS However, the minister continues to turn a deaf ear. EOS BOS The budget is inadequate, there is no long-term vision and there is no prevention. EOS BOS In short, his management seems to be disastrous, at best. EOS BOS Will the minister do more than say he accepts the Auditor General's recommendations and finally take meaningful action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in addition to accepting the recommendations, I would remind the hon. EOS BOS member that last week I met with my colleagues from all the provinces and territories in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. EOS BOS I told them that we would be taking a new approach to ensure that first nations would be protected in emergency situations. EOS BOS I invite the member to read the press release for more information. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the Conservative government has failed first nations, this time on emergency preparedness. EOS BOS The Auditor General found that the department is stuck in a cycle of reacting to disasters and not doing enough to prevent and mitigate emergencies. EOS BOS Year after year, money set aside to respond to fires, floods and the lack of safe housing is not adequate. EOS BOS When is the minister going to end this cycle of waiting for disasters to happen, and act to fix the problems that cause these emergencies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in all fairness to the Auditor General, the hon. EOS BOS member will acknowledge, recognize and admit that the Auditor General acknowledges our commitment to improve emergency management to support first nations. EOS BOS As I just said en français, last week I announced that the government is implementing a new comprehensive approach to emergency management on reserve that will ensure better coordination with the provinces and more accountability for taxpayers, which I know they do not care much about. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week the Minister of Veterans Affairs tabled a response to a unanimous committee report on a review of the veterans charter. EOS BOS The minister's response is extremely disappointing. EOS BOS His answers were vague. EOS BOS There is no new money and the government says it needs more time to study the problem. EOS BOS The committee heard heartbreaking testimony about the challenges veterans and their families face. EOS BOS Why is the minister dragging his heels instead of urgently addressing the needs of Canadian veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is taking action. EOS BOS First and foremost, I would like to thank that member and all opposition members for working in a very non-partisan way to come up with a unanimous report. EOS BOS Let us not forget all sides agree that the new veterans charter is a great foundation upon which Canadian veterans can be supported, while the benefits and investments for veterans are being increased by more than $4.7 billion since 2006. EOS BOS Our government agrees with the vast majority of the recommendations, both in spirit and intent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have seen study after study identifying ways to improve the veterans charter, from the parliamentary committee, from the Veterans Ombudsman and from many veterans organizations. EOS BOS The studies are done. EOS BOS Now is the time for action to assist veterans and their families who need help. EOS BOS Our veterans should not have to fight to receive benefits. EOS BOS How much longer will Canadian veterans and their families have to wait for the current government to take real action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would encourage that member to get his facts in order. EOS BOS Let me just read a quote from Tim Laidler, who is an Afghanistan war veteran and executive director of the Veterans Transition Network. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS It is a step in the right direction.... EOS BOS Veterans...need the changes [the minister] is bringing in”. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's response to the unanimous report of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs is disappointing to say the least. EOS BOS The minister has postponed the implementation of major recommendations to help veterans. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Veterans Ombudsman said that he, too, was very concerned about the timeline for implementing the recommendations. EOS BOS Will the minister quickly find the money to address the plight of veterans or would he rather save a few dollars at veterans' expense? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is taking action. EOS BOS It has a strong record when it comes to providing benefits and services for Canada's veterans. EOS BOS Let me read another quote from Tom Eagles, dominion president of the Royal Canadian Legion. EOS BOS He said, “we appreciate that these issues are complex and require considerable time, effort and financial resources to implement”.I would encourage the member opposite to stop playing political games when it comes to Canada's veterans, get on board with the government and support us if he really cares about them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Friday, Finance Canada confirmed what we always said would happen, that the government took a Conservative surplus and turned it into a Liberal deficit. EOS BOS We know how this works. EOS BOS They had the best March madness ever. EOS BOS It was fantastic. EOS BOS Therefore, what we want to know is whether cabinet ministers were actually urged to splurge in order to make sure that the finance minister got the deficit he predicted. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have been saying in the House for many months, the government before us left us with a deficit. EOS BOS The “ EOS BOS Fiscal Monitor” EOS BOS , this past Friday, told us in black and white what is absolutely the case. EOS BOS Due to the economic realities left by the measures from the previous government we have a deficit, a deficit from the previous government. EOS BOS Now the question is, what are we going to do moving forward? We are going to invest to make the future rosier than the past for Canadians by focusing on growth. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the “ EOS BOS Fiscal Monitor” EOS BOS confirms the fact that the Liberals inherited a surplus from the Conservative government. EOS BOS It also confirms, though sadly, that just one short month, at the very end of the year, they were able to turn that surplus into a deficit. EOS BOS While they preach the gospel of deficit spending, they stand alone because their G7 partners are still stuck on this whole balanced budget thing. EOS BOS Did the minister engineer this deficit? EOS BOS Is he just proving to Canadians that he can spend it as quickly as we left it for him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, facts matter. EOS BOS The facts are that the “Fiscal Monitor” shows us—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. I am sure the minister appreciates the applause deeply. EOS BOS However, let us wait until he finishes his answer, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Finance. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, facts matter. EOS BOS I would urge the members on the others side to actually read the “ EOS BOS Fiscal Monitor”. EOS BOS What they will find is that the government before us left us with a deficit. EOS BOS What they will find is that, as in previous years, revenues go down and expenses go up at the end of the year. EOS BOS This year revenues went down precipitously because of the measures of the previous government. EOS BOS That is the situation we face now. EOS BOS We are focused on how we are going to deal with what was left to us by the previous government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the evidence continues to pile up that the finance minister has a serious problem when it comes to transparency. EOS BOS Page 7 of his own February economic update details how his Liberal spending spree was already well under way last year. EOS BOS Again in March he burned through billions in one month and has driven us into a deficit. EOS BOS Why does the finance minister refuse to take responsibility for his own deficits? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would urge the member to actually go through the “ EOS BOS Fiscal Monitor” EOS BOS line by line to find out the facts. EOS BOS When we take out the measures that we have put in, what we find is that the previous government left us with a deficit. EOS BOS It is absolutely clear, and it is something that they are going to need to look at and realize. EOS BOS We are going to do what Canadians asked us to do, which is to deal with what was left to us by the previous government. EOS BOS We are going to invest to make a real difference for Canadians in the future. EOS BOS We are improving our country through improved growth. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the issue here is transparency. EOS BOS The finance minister is cooking the books to suit his reckless political spending and agenda. EOS BOS He was left with a Conservative surplus. EOS BOS He did turn that into a Liberal deficit. EOS BOS The finance minister needs to come clean and show some transparency. EOS BOS Will he tell Canadians exactly how he spent $10 billion on the reckless Liberal schemes in March? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would invite the member opposite to take a look at what has happened over the last number of years in March with the previous government. EOS BOS What happens is in March revenues go down. EOS BOS This year what happened was what has happened in previous years, only worse. EOS BOS The measures put in place by the previous government led revenues to go down at the end of the year, leaving us with a deficit. EOS BOS We are starting with a deficit left by the previous government and now we are making efforts to really improve our situation going forward.
              Canadians expect growth for this generation and the next generation, and we are going to deliver it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first the government made the unilateral decision to allow supertankers to go through Montreal and Quebec City. EOS BOS Now the federalist parties have agreed to run the oil pipeline through Quebec, whether Quebec likes it or not. EOS BOS It is rather ironic that Quebec has to fight to have a say on what happens on its territory. EOS BOS Will the Minister of the Environment live up to her title and finally stop imposing all these economic, social, and environmental risks on Quebeckers, just to fatten up western oil companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are embarking upon Canada's most ambitious trade agenda, and in doing so we want to ensure that we are able to get our goods to market and are able to receive goods from other markets as well. EOS BOS That is the importance of the St. Lawrence River to us. EOS BOS It is to make sure that we can flow goods as far into the continent as possible. EOS BOS I am very proud of all the federal ports along the river, from Sept-Îles all the way to the Port of Montreal. EOS BOS They do great service for Canadians and are an important part of our chain. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to supporting science and funding partnerships that lead to discoveries and the products of tomorrow. EOS BOS Today I was at my alma mater, the University of Ottawa, looking at research that, once achieved, will change the lives of Canadians by allowing everyday objects to become smart. EOS BOS [Translation] EOS BOS Can the Minister of Science inform the House of the strategic investments made by our government to ensure that we support scientists and encourage innovation and a strong middle class? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to supporting scientific research, both basic and applied. EOS BOS [English]
              Today I announced over $50 million for projects in NSERC's strategic partnerships, which cross-connect companies with scientists who are advancing research in areas where Canada is a world leader. EOS BOS From the water we drink, to the air we breathe, to new technologies, support for science will help build a better future for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, law enforcement agencies in Canada work hard to fight organized crime, but police officers have to deal with budget and legal constraints. EOS BOS In addition, aboriginal women are overrepresented when it comes to violence and tragic disappearances. EOS BOS Here too, the police would like to have new legislative tools from the government. EOS BOS With Bill C-51, the government is overlooking key safety issues and sidestepping other serious problems. EOS BOS Does the government think it makes sense to combat terrorism when so many other situations also require expanded legal powers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a government's primary role is to protect its citizens. EOS BOS Women in particular are often targeted by terrorists, which is why we need to do everything in our power to protect them as much as men. EOS BOS That is why I invite my colleague to support Bill C-51. EOS BOS If she has any questions on that, I would be glad to answer them. EOS BOS I was happy to appear before the committee for two hours. EOS BOS This is an important bill that promotes the rights and freedoms of Canadians, while also protecting them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, children and their families who have been impacted for years by the no-fly list are on Parliament Hill today demanding an end to this human rights violation. EOS BOS There are children as young as six being denied from boarding flights. EOS BOS Canadians want to see a properly funded redress system in the 2018 federal budget, and they want an end to the hundreds, if not thousands, of false positives that have occurred to date. EOS BOS When will the government finally heed these calls and end this injustice for families once and for all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we fully appreciate the frustration of law-abiding travellers who can be stigmatized and delayed as a result of false positives on the no-fly list. EOS BOS However, to be clear, there are no children on the no-fly list, but there is confusion among similar names. EOS BOS That takes new legislation to fix that problem, new regulations, and a new computer system. EOS BOS The first of those steps is being taken in Bill C-59. EOS BOS I urge the NDP to vote for it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Bill C-59, as those parents said today at their press conference, does nothing to fix the problem that they face every single time they try to travel. EOS BOS I would ask the minister if he wants to go in front of those families to tell them, “ EOS BOS Do not worry, your child is not on the list. EOS BOS ” These are the false positives that are being lived by thousands of Canadians. EOS BOS [Translation]
               Children, business people, and even veterans are finding travelling difficult. EOS BOS They are being humiliated, profiled, and are living in fear of ending up on the no-fly list. EOS BOS Again I ask the minister: will she fully fund an actual redress system, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the no-fly list that was designed 10 years ago contains an inherent design flaw that needs to be fixed. EOS BOS To fix it takes legislation and regulation and a new computer system built from the bottom up. EOS BOS The first step is to pass Bill C-59 to give us the legal authority to do these things. EOS BOS I urge the NDP to support Bill C-59. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since taking office, the Prime Minister has repeatedly contradicted his minister's hints that a referendum might be okay. EOS BOS Yesterday his objection was, “ EOS BOS This process is more complex than the “yes or no” of a referendum. EOS BOS ” I promised myself that I would not raise quantum computing or one-armed planks in question period, but facts are facts, and in this universe the decision whether or not to endorse a new voting system that his government will propose really is a binary decision, yes or no. EOS BOS Based on this new information, will the Prime Minister now agree to hold a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today is a great day. EOS BOS I am looking forward to the vote following question period where we all put our confidence in a parliamentary committee made up of all parties whose responsibility it is to reach out to all our constituents and bring their voices and their values into the conversation about electoral reform. EOS BOS I look forward to this co-operative and collaborative style of governance for many years to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's latest excuse to deny Canadians the final say in a new voting system from just earlier in this question period is, “we need open consultations, not a closed question”. EOS BOS This, of course, completely contradicts the minister who yesterday said that consultations were only step one of a three-stage process. EOS BOS Therefore, at some point, when stages one and two are done, a closed question will be appropriate, something like this, “ EOS BOS Should election 2019 take place under the voting system proposed by the government, yes or no? EOS BOS ” Is that not a reasonable question? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as always, we remain open and receptive to respectful and reasonable arguments. EOS BOS Today, we take step one of a long journey for which we are all responsible to ensure that as we move forward toward modernizing our electoral system and our democratic institutions, the voices of our constituents are included in our decision-making process. EOS BOS Let us focus on step one, one step at a time. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2012, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and father of the clarity bill felt that it would be necessary to hold a referendum before any changes could be made to the voting system. EOS BOS He said, “Precedent makes holding a referendum necessary in Canada: changing the voting system would require popular support.”Three-quarters of the population share that opinion. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Democratic Institutions tell us what she told the minister behind closed doors to make him go back on his own words? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the process of electoral reform requires the attention and the care of all members of the House. EOS BOS Today we will be voting on establishing an all-party committee whose responsibility it will be to reach out to our constituents, particularly those who have not been included in this conversation in the past, to ensure that the process and the outcome make sense for all of us. EOS BOS Let us focus on the work of the committee. EOS BOS There is a lot riding on this. EOS BOS We are all counting on it to do this work. EOS BOS I am looking forward to the vote today. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it seems like the Minister of Democratic Institutions cannot even keep her talking points straight for a single answer. EOS BOS She has told the House that she wants to hear from Canadians, while in the same answer has stated that politicians should make the decision. EOS BOS Which is it? EOS BOS Politicians making the decision, or will the minister actually drop the talking points and leave this decision directly in the hands of Canadians through a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have no notes at my disposal. EOS BOS Let us review what we are here to do. EOS BOS Canadians have elected us to come to this place and to represent them with dignity and with full co-operation. EOS BOS That is what we are doing today. EOS BOS A committee will come together, made up of all parliamentarians, to reach out to Canadians and to hear from them first on what values and what aspirations they have for their electoral system. EOS BOS Let us recognize our responsibility to do this work right. EOS BOS Once again, I am really looking forward to the vote. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government recently announced the oceans protection plan. EOS BOS The House should know that investing in marine safety not only benefits coastal communities but watershed communities, like my riding of Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge. EOS BOS Could the minister tell the House about the measures the OPP takes with regard to improving marine safety? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the $1.5 billion oceans protection plan will indeed seriously improve marine safety. EOS BOS It will make us more quickly aware of any marine incidents. EOS BOS It will help us respond more effectively and more rapidly. EOS BOS It will involve our coastal first nations, who will be trained and equipped and given the authority to respond to local marine incidents. EOS BOS It will improve our hydrographic services for better navigation. EOS BOS It will ensure that certain critical fish habitats are protected, as well as marine species. EOS BOS We want to make sure that our coasts are safe, clean, and healthy for generations to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as part of the European Union free trade negotiations, talks have been under way since 2009 to get Canada to agree to extend patent protection for prescription drugs by at least three years, which would increase their price by close to $3 billion. EOS BOS An independent report published this summer and commissioned by the European Commission indicates that this agreement could have a negative impact on consumers of pharmaceutical products in Canada. EOS BOS In light of this report, will the government finally protect the interests of Canadians and our health care system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would remind the member that this government always protects and advances Canada's interests during international negotiations. EOS BOS We will only enter into an agreement that is in the best interests of Canada. EOS BOS We continue to consult closely with Canadians, stakeholders, and provincial and territorial governments. EOS BOS The member opposite should not prejudge the outcome of these negotiations. EOS BOS She should know that this government will always stand up for the interests of Canadians. EOS BOS We will only sign an agreement that represents those interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the finance minister defends tax havens by insisting that they do not actually need to be fixed, that there is no problem. EOS BOS Now, we thought the finance minister was just protecting his own interests within his family company, but it turns out that there is actually a whole crew of Liberals who are colluding together in order to keep these tax loopholes open. EOS BOS My question is very simple, and that is: When did the Prime Minister become aware that the Liberal Party's head of revenue, Stephen Bronfman, was sheltering money in offshore accounts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. EOS BOS In the last two budgets, we invested nearly $1 billion, and our plan is working. EOS BOS There have been 627 cases transferred to criminal investigations, 268 search warrants, and 78 convictions. EOS BOS The Canada Revenue Agency is reviewing links to Canadian entities and will take appropriate action with respect to the paradise papers. EOS BOS We are working to make the tax system fair for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they say their plan is working, but it is the media that is working. EOS BOS That is how we know about the paradise papers. EOS BOS The finance minister has defended offshore tax havens in places like Barbados by saying he does not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. EOS BOS It seems that the babies the minister was referring to are a bunch of the Prime Minister's friends and Liberal Party donors. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister quit attacking farmers and small business owners and start investigating Liberal Party donors who are using offshore tax havens? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. EOS BOS I am proud of the leadership role Canada has taken on the international stage. EOS BOS Tax evasion is a global problem that requires collaboration with all of our international partners. EOS BOS The nearly $1 billion we have invested is yielding results. EOS BOS We are on track to recoup close to $25 billion. EOS BOS Criminal charges are being laid, and search warrants are being executed. EOS BOS We made a promise to Canadians, and we are doing what we promised. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, middle-class Canadians continue to hear the Prime Minister demand tax fairness from them, but when it comes to Liberal Party donors and wealthy insiders, the Prime Minister practises instead tax forgiveness. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister end his two-tier taxation policy and start making Liberal insiders and donors pay their fair share of Liberal spending, rather than going after hard-working Canadian small business owners and farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as Minister of National Revenue, I can say that there will be no double standard. EOS BOS Everyone must obey the law. EOS BOS That is one of the conditions of a fair tax system. EOS BOS We made a promise during the election campaign, and we have taken concrete steps to fulfill that promise. EOS BOS We have invested nearly $1 billion, and our investment is bearing fruit. EOS BOS We are going to keep working for Canadians, as they asked us to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week our government introduced the historic marketing freedom for grain farmers act in the House. EOS BOS Unfortunately, this past week has shown a desperate opposition willing to pull any underhanded trick in the book to try to undo last night's vote on the bill. EOS BOS Yesterday the member for Winnipeg Centre said, “ EOS BOS There are ways to reverse a vote”.Can the Minister of Agriculture please explain why our government will not be bullied by the NDP on this very important legislation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member for Palliser is absolutely right. EOS BOS The opposition will stop at nothing to try to intimidate farmers, whether they are sitting in the House or out in western Canada, not to move ahead with marketing freedom, but of course they do not represent them. EOS BOS Having said that, the member for Winnipeg Centre also went out afterward and recanted,  saying his actions are purely political and not grounded in reality. EOS BOS What he did then was actually say about the Conservative MPs, who he is trying to sideline, “ EOS BOS They wouldn't be in a conflict of interest”, so I am not sure whether he is on or he is off, but we do know that he is wrong. EOS BOS We agree that farmers will never be intimidated by those kinds of ridiculous tactics. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I too have an excellent question. EOS BOS The National Optics Institute, a global leader located in Quebec City, has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs to prosper. EOS BOS This institute has a plan to expand into Ontario and Alberta to create jobs. EOS BOS The chairman of the board called for assistance this morning and got radio silence. EOS BOS The government is not responding to this Canadian gem. EOS BOS The Prime Minister instructed the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development not to address issues from the Quebec City area. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister allow the minister to help out the National Optics Institute, which is in his own riding? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite knows, we are very much engaged with the institute. EOS BOS We have heard their funding request. EOS BOS As we do with all requests, we base it on merit. EOS BOS We look at the best possible outcomes to commercialize these ideas, to help make sure we help small businesses and grow the economy. EOS BOS This is a great initiative and we look forward to supporting it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians want to know that they are safe within their communities. EOS BOS They want to know that their loved ones are protected. EOS BOS The people of my community want to be able to enjoy life without fear of gang-related violence in their neighbourhoods, and they know that only our Conservative government can deliver on a solid, tough on crime agenda. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness update the House on the situation on the ground in Surrey? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from South Surrey—White Rock— EOS BOS Cloverdale for his efforts, and I can assure him that our government's priority is to make our communities safer. EOS BOS (1450)[English]I am pleased to confirm that the deployment of the first 20 members committed to Surrey is under way and that boots are already on the ground. EOS BOS What is clear also is that, while our Conservative government has passed more than 30 new measures to crack down on crime, including new prison sentences for drive-by shooting, investing millions in crime prevention, the Liberals and the NDP oppose those measures every step of the way while we Conservatives are delivering. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the sixth meeting of the Somalia High Level Partnership Forum was recently held in Istanbul, Turkey. EOS BOS The meeting was attended by 46 countries, including Canada. EOS BOS With the end of the terms of the federal government and parliament in Somalia, 2016 is a decisive year for Somalia. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Foreign Affairs update the House on this important meeting and Canada's contribution to the international community's effort to support a more democratic, secure, and prosperous future for the people of Somalia? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to answer the first question ever asked in the House on Somalia by a member of Parliament of Somalian origin. EOS BOS This year will be crucial for Somalia. EOS BOS It will have a constitutional review, the implementation of a federal structure, and national elections. EOS BOS This would be a challenging agenda for any country, including Canada. EOS BOS Canada will be there with Somalia this year and for the long term. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is traditional in Canada to make sacrifices in order to ensure prosperity for future generations, but this Prime Minister is doing the opposite. EOS BOS He is asking the next generation to make sacrifices to pay for his out-of-control spending. EOS BOS He once again confirmed this week that he has abandoned his promise of a return to a balanced budget in 2019. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister understand that Canadians do not want to leave an astronomical Liberal debt for our children and grandchildren? EOS </s> BOS Quite the contrary, Mr. Speaker, Canadians made a very clear choice in the last election. EOS BOS They could vote for a party that was going to balance the budget at any cost with cuts, or vote for a party that would govern by investing in our future, giving more money to the middle class, raising the taxes on the wealthiest 1% and investing in our communities, in public transit, in social housing and in building a better future for our citizens. EOS BOS That is exactly what we committed to doing and that is exactly what we are delivering to Canadians and future generations. EOS
BOS Well, Mr. Speaker, Canadians were given a choice, and one of the choices was a modest and temporary deficit. EOS BOS He has broken both of those promises. EOS BOS This means billions more taxpayer dollars spent on paying interest payments to banks and bondholders instead of investing in services, like health care, education, or new tax cuts. EOS BOS Now we know the Prime Minister is not even going to try to balance the budget, but could he at least try to try, since now we know budgets just do not balance themselves? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is humorous to hear the members opposite talk about investing in health, in education, in infrastructure, when for 10 years they did not do enough of that. EOS BOS We got elected on a commitment to invest in—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I am having trouble hearing the Prime Minister. EOS BOS I want to hear all members when it is their turn to speak and preferably not when it is not their turn to speak. EOS BOS The right hon. Prime Minister. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we got elected on a commitment to invest in Canadians, to invest in their future, to lower taxes on the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%, to deliver a Canada child benefit that gives more money to nine out of 10 Canadian families, by stopping to send Conservative cheques to millionaires. EOS BOS That is what we promised. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Transportation Safety Board is reporting more accidents, runaway trains, and other serious, preventable accidents, yet Transport Canada is delaying tougher measures that could stop not only disasters like Lac-Mégantic but 500 runaway trains over the past two decades. EOS BOS Transport inspectors and rail workers have called for strengthened controls and stepped-up inspection and enforcement. EOS BOS So far there has been nothing. EOS BOS When will the minister stop talking and start taking action to make our rail system safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, we have been taking action. EOS BOS I have been very clear since the beginning that rail safety is my top priority. EOS BOS In fact, I am very glad that in this last budget $143 million was put aside over three years for rail safety. EOS BOS Yes, we have taken measures. EOS BOS In fact, the member's party was present when we announced some of these measures. EOS BOS Therefore, we are taking rail safety very seriously. EOS BOS I have said it many times. EOS BOS The measures put in place since Lac-Mégantic are a beginning but they are not sufficient and we will be doing more for rail safety. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a priority. EOS BOS I went to Lac-Mégantic with my colleague from Sherbrooke last week, and I can say to the minister that the residents are not impressed with how this government is dragging its feet.
              The Lac-Mégantic tragedy was three years ago, and EOS BOS yet we still have a long way to go to ensure a safe rail system. EOS BOS The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is telling us that there have been more and more problems with runaway trains and that Transport Canada is not doing enough to improve safety procedures. EOS BOS Will the minister stop with the rhetoric and finally do something to guarantee a safe rail system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I just said. EOS BOS I have the utmost respect for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. EOS BOS We listen every time it makes any recommendations. EOS BOS As I have clearly stated, rail safety is my top priority. EOS BOS If my colleague would take a little time to look at the measures we have taken, he would see that we have already taken action. EOS BOS Is it enough? EOS BOS No. EOS BOS As we have said very clearly, additional measures are needed, and there is money in the budget for that purpose. EOS BOS We will address rail safety, because it is my top priority. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Conservatives are way behind in spending for peace building and democracy projects. EOS BOS Last year the Minister of Foreign Affairs approved 85 projects. EOS BOS This year the minister has approved only 23 projects and the rest are sitting on his or the Prime Minister's desk. EOS BOS When the Conservatives use their partisan and ideological tactics it puts the NGOs and their staff in jeopardy. EOS BOS Most of all, it fails Canada's commitment to help the poor and devastated regions of the world. EOS BOS The minister should stop playing with people's lives and approve these projects. EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I would like to tell my hon. colleague that the core principle of this government is promotion of human rights and democracy, and one of them is building peacekeeping. EOS BOS In whatever we do this government will stand behind promotion of democracy, ensuring peace around the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals promised that cozying up to Iran would get results, even though the Iranian regime boasts about funding terrorist proxies, has a rogue ballistic missile system, and makes proclamations aimed at the destruction of Israel. EOS BOS That is even while Canadian resident Saeed Malekpour languishes in an Iranian prison. EOS BOS Now we learn the Liberals have sent diplomats to Iran perhaps to fulfill another misguided campaign promise to open an embassy our Conservative government closed because of the security risks to diplomats. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the best way to advance human rights and consular issues in Iran is by talking directly with the regime. EOS BOS By raising these issues directly, we are holding Iran to account. EOS BOS That is what I did yesterday in my conversation with the foreign minister and what our officials will do this week. EOS BOS Let me be clear. EOS BOS We oppose Iran's support for terrorist organizations, its threats toward Israel, its ballistic missile program, and its support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is not a fisheries group in Canada that supports the elimination of the owner-operator fleet separation policy. EOS BOS I introduced a motion to have the fisheries committee hear from the people who would suffer the most when these policies are removed. EOS BOS Did the government vote this motion down because the inshore fishers have something that the corporate sector wants? EOS BOS Why is the government going to sacrifice communities in Quebec and Atlantic Canada just to satisfy corporate greed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member obviously has a crystal ball, but I do not. EOS BOS The member opposite has been in the House for some 25 years and knows full well that committees answer to the House and that a committee's business is the committee's business. EOS BOS As for the government's interest in the matter, as I said before, we are looking for input from fishermen to listen to their ideas about the future of the fishery. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Let us get back to the mammoth budget bill. EOS BOS Today, the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy released a scathing report on the Conservatives' failure to take action on climate change. EOS BOS The report is clear: Canada will not meet its greenhouse gas reductions target and, by not taking action now, the Conservatives will force future generations to pay a high price. EOS BOS Is the real reason why the Prime Minister is dismantling the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy that it is doing its job well and condemning the Conservative government's failures in environmental policy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I note that the report indicates that the government made considerable progress last year with respect to its targets. EOS BOS There are obviously other actions to be considered. EOS BOS However, the reality is that emissions in Canada were increasing rapidly when this government came to power. EOS BOS Today, however, our greenhouse gas emissions are declining. EOS BOS We intend to continue down this path. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has already admitted that his Trojan Horse budget will be used to slash funding for any group that has the gall to disagree with Conservative policy. EOS BOS That apparently includes the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy because it gives him facts that contradict the decisions he has already made. EOS BOS Last year, the Supreme Court had to order the Prime Minister to practise fact-based decision making, not decision-based fact making. EOS BOS Why does he keep getting it wrong? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the report notes, the Government of Canada has made increased progress toward its commitments to the actions it has undertaken over the past year. EOS BOS The government will look at additional actions. EOS BOS The reality, as I said before, is that when this government came to office, the emissions of greenhouse gases were increasing rapidly. EOS BOS Under this government, emissions of greenhouse gases have actually begun to decline and this government has done that while our economy continues to grow. EOS BOS We have every intention of continuing down this path. EOS
BOS I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the Ladies Gallery of the participants of the 13th Canadian Parliamentary Seminar, organized by the Canadian Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS I have another recognition. EOS BOS Almost 150 years ago, journalists took their seats for the first time in the reporters’ gallery of the original Centre Block, and the Parliamentary Press Gallery was born. EOS BOS Today, press gallery members continue to have a place set aside in this chamber, and they perform an important democratic function. EOS BOS [Translation]
              I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of two former hon. EOS BOS members of the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery:
              [English]
              Helen Brimmell, nee Bannerman, was the third woman in history to become an official member of the gallery, in 1946. EOS BOS She was one of only two women reporting on the Hill at the time. EOS BOS She worked for The Canadian Press, The Royal Gazette in Bermuda, the Oshawa Times-Gazette, and the Guelph Mercury. EOS BOS Helen retired in 1990. EOS BOS [Translation]
              Bernard Dufresne joined the Parliamentary Press Gallery in 1954 as a young Canadian Press journalist. EOS BOS He worked here until 1960 and then returned from 1963 to 1965 as a correspondent for The Globe and Mail. EOS BOS He then became a minister's assistant in the government of the day before joining the public service until he retired in 1989. EOS BOS Some hon members: Hear, hear! EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. EOS BOS I apologize for my outburst during question period. EOS BOS However, as the father of an intellectually disabled adult son, I find it reprehensible that the Minister of Democratic Institutions would use the disabled, insinuating— EOS </s> BOS The member is engaging in debate, as he knows. EOS BOS I appreciate the apology. EOS BOS The member cannot engage in debate as a point of order. EOS BOS This is debate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, an Environment Canada study has found that contaminants are accumulating in the snow near oil sands operations. EOS BOS These results confirm those of previous research that the Conservatives prefer to ignore. EOS BOS Science should be based on facts, even if it goes against their ideology. EOS BOS Why are Environment Canada's scientists not allowed to talk about this study? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it was precisely the advice of the scientific community that led us to set up, design and have a monitoring plan for the lower Athabasca River in the area of the oil sands that is peer reviewed by the scientific community. EOS BOS It is being implemented jointly by the Government of Canada, Environment Canada and the Government of Alberta. EOS BOS I can assure my colleague that this world-class plan will result in an improved understanding of the cumulative effects of the long-term environmental side effects of oil sands development. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister's answer but we have actual facts here. The study was kept secret and the scientists who did the research were muzzled. EOS BOS Instead of providing information about water contamination to the public, Conservatives concocted spin and downplayed the findings they found inconvenient. EOS BOS Spin will not protect our waterways nor will it protect the Canadians who drink from them. EOS BOS How can the minister look at this study and still agree to further weaken environmental protection in the budget bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if I can correct my colleague, the incident mentioned was in fact reported in 2011 by the scientists who conducted the study at an international conference in Boston. EOS BOS The results of follow-up monitoring have confirmed that water in the Athabasca River absolutely shows lower levels of contaminants than those that pose a concern for aquatic life. EOS BOS This government can balance environmental stewardship and our recovering economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance has answered only one question on the budget, and he barely answered that. I wonder if he would not mind standing in his place and explaining to the House what his position is on income splitting. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. EOS BOS member for Markham—Unionville that I am standing in my place. EOS BOS The budget is not balanced yet, as he may have noted yesterday. EOS BOS We hope and we expect that it will be balanced next year. EOS BOS We remain committed to tax relief for Canadian families. EOS
BOS Let us start with facts, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS The fact is that the middle class grew by 30% over the last 10 years. EOS BOS Here is an interesting fact. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's Office has already spent more on polling than the previous Conservative government spent in eight years. EOS BOS Millions of tax dollars are being spent to track Canadians' views for the political benefit of the Prime Minister. EOS BOS I have a really simple question for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Has the Prime Minister polled Canadians on whether or not he should keep his promise to balance the budget in 2019? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite wants to talk about facts. EOS BOS The fact is, the very first thing we did in government was lower taxes on the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the fact also is that that party voted against raising taxes on the wealthiest and lowering them on the middle class. EOS BOS That, unfortunately, demonstrates that they still do not understand that Canadians need investments in the middle class and support for the middle class, not for the wealthiest, like they did for 10 years. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime. EOS BOS That is why they gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. EOS BOS One of the most disturbing trends is the recent surge in child pornography. EOS BOS Yesterday the Ontario Provincial Police announced the arrest of over 60 individuals on various child pornography charges. EOS BOS Disturbingly, the police also identified over 9,000 Internet protocol addresses that were involved in the downloading and distribution of child pornography. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please comment on this situation? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Ontario Provincial Police for taking these dangerous individuals off our streets. EOS BOS Sexually exploiting our children is absolutely despicable. EOS BOS As technology evolves, many criminal activities, such as the distribution of child pornography, become much easier. EOS BOS That is why our government will be reintroducing lawful access legislation. EOS BOS Rather than making things easier for child pornographers, I call on the NDP to listen to the police, listen to the provinces, and support these balanced measures that protect law-abiding Canadians and their children. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government promised gender parity for its senior appointments, and that means fifty-fifty. EOS BOS However, only a quarter of federal crown corporation and agency directors are women. EOS BOS One in four is not gender parity. EOS BOS It is not even close. EOS BOS According to the Canadian Board Diversity Council, the government's approach is insufficient, and “ EOS BOS quotas may be necessary to bring about the desired change”.Will the government support my bill to ensure equal representation? EOS BOS It is a simple question, yes or no. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that when women are involved in every aspect of our democratic society, Canada does better as a whole. EOS BOS That is why we are so focused on ensuring that women have the same opportunities for economic success, for leadership, and to contribute to our country. EOS BOS I look forward to continuing this work with all members of the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for years New Democrats and many others have been calling for a comprehensive strategy and action to improve mental health services for Canadians. EOS BOS Canada's mental health system is poorly coordinated and underfunded. EOS BOS The Mental Health Commission today called for a long-overdue overhaul of this broken system. EOS BOS The federal government must stop neglecting mental health care and take leadership to ensure that Canadians receive the care they deserve. EOS BOS What actions will the government take to implement the recommendations of this report, and when will we see these long-overdue changes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we welcome the release of the mental health strategy this morning from the Mental Health Commission of Canada. EOS BOS As the opposition member knows, this important commission was created under our government. EOS BOS We are proud of the work that it has done so far. EOS BOS Our government will continue to work with the provinces and the territories in their efforts. EOS BOS We have committed to a long-term stable funding arrangement that will see health transfers reach record-high levels by the end of the decade. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question was, what action will the federal government take on the recommendations that came out today? EOS BOS The report outlines the need for collaboration and coordination among all levels of government. EOS BOS Canadians need to see a significant federal investment in mental health. EOS BOS Enough of the self-congratulations. EOS BOS Will the government implement these recommendations, or is it really just washing its hands and leaving it to the strained provincial budgets to pick up the slack? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once elected, our government took quick action. EOS BOS In fact, we formed the Mental Health Commission during the first year of our mandate. EOS BOS The Liberal record is deplorable. EOS BOS All the Liberals did was to cut transfers to the jurisdictions. EOS BOS As for the NDP members, it is a bit rich that they ask such a question, as they voted against the establishment of the Mental Health Commission EOS BOS .We will continue to work with the provinces and territories in the rollout of these recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that cuts to the public service could prevent qualified young workers from getting good quality jobs. EOS BOS Furthermore, the government's newly lowered growth projections do not predict anything good for our young workers. EOS BOS We have an unacceptable unemployment rate of over 14%. EOS BOS What is the minister doing to stop wasting the talent of our young people? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, both the IMF and the OECD anticipate that Canada will have the strongest economic growth in the G7. EOS BOS We have the best job creation record in the G7, 650,000 jobs since the end of the recession in July 2009. EOS BOS We have the strongest banking system in the world, the strongest fiscal system in the world, and the best net debt to GDP ratio in the G7. EOS BOS As I said, we are on track for modest growth this year and next. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives love to present misleading job creation numbers. EOS BOS The truth is that we have lost 220,000 jobs for young people since the recession began. EOS BOS Unemployment is up, economic indicators are down and, according to the Bank of Canada, our economy is slowing to a crawl. EOS BOS Conservatives want Canadians to believe that corporate tax giveaways to profitable companies are the answer. EOS BOS They are  not. EOS BOS When will the minister have something more than empty talking points to offer jobless Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I invite the member opposite to tell the 650,000 Canadians who are working now as result of the economic action plan that their jobs do not matter to them and that the government's policy has not mattered to them. EOS BOS This is the policy that the NDP voted against. EOS BOS This is the job creation policy that NDP members talk about, but every time we bring a measure to the House, they vote against the measure, depriving Canadians of jobs. EOS BOS Now they have the nerve to suggest job creation programs. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, this week Canadians learned on a website that Russia has now banned our seal products. EOS BOS This new embargo, in addition to that of the European Union, is a threat to the sealing industry. EOS BOS However, instead of negotiating an agreement for our fishers, the Conservatives are playing political games. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stop playing games and open a dialogue in which stakeholders in the Canadian fishery can participate? EOS BOS Will he finally help them to address the major challenges they face? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the hon. member should be paying attention to what the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of International Trade have been doing. EOS BOS We have been working on behalf of Canadian sealers since we formed government and we will continue to do exactly that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Bill C-377, introduced by a Conservative backbencher, is that party's latest assault on Canada's workers. EOS BOS It creates a bureaucratic monster and red tape that will cost millions of dollars to manage and administer, all under the pretext of transparency. EOS BOS Let us talk about transparency. EOS BOS We are told that this bill is a personal initiative. EOS BOS Really? EOS BOS Well-funded anti-union groups have held dozens of meetings behind closed doors with high-ranking Conservatives. EOS BOS Can someone tell me what the Prime Minister's chief of staff or the Minister of Finance's policy director have to do with this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we believe that workers should have the right to know how their mandatory union dues are spent. EOS BOS That said, we are meeting with groups on both sides of this debate, unlike the NDP, which by contrast has held 75 meetings combined, with the Canadian Labour Congress, CUPE and PSAC, three unions that together gave the NDP $61,000 in illegal union money. EOS BOS Speaking of PSAC, it represents federal public servants whose jobs rely on a united Canada, but it endorsed the separatists in the last provincial election. EOS BOS What does the member think about that? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that notorious union buster Terrance Oakey is once again darkening the towels of the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS After successfully killing off the fair wages act, his next target is Bill C-377, the Conservatives' latest assault on labour. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives letting the special interests of one well-connected Conservative lobbyist upset the labour peace in this country? EOS BOS If they do want to declare war on labour, why do they not do it through the front door instead of skulking around with a private member's bill like a bunch of cowards? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I always have to congratulate that member for the creative imagery that he brings to the House. EOS BOS Now that he is talking about groups that are skulking around the Hill, meeting and trying to lobby the interests of the government and Parliament, maybe he can tell us a little more about what happened at those 75 closed door meetings that his party held with the Canadian Labour Congress, with CUPE, with PSAC, all groups that gave a combined $61,000 in illegal union money? EOS BOS What happened at those meetings? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister really likes slogans and sound bites, such as the one about 2015 being the last election under the current system. EOS BOS I see this is still a sore point for the Prime Minister, but what happened to his promise to cut small business taxes? EOS BOS Well, in committee, his minister responsible for small business said that this promise was, and I quote, a sound bite to get elected. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister turning his back on his promise and at the same time going ahead with a privatization bank that he never mentioned during the campaign? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know what our small businesses need: economic growth. EOS BOS Following 10 years of a government that failed in this area, we are working to put more money in the pockets of the middle class and create opportunities for our small businesses. EOS BOS By connecting our small businesses to global markets, especially through the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which the previous government was unable to conclude but we managed to do so, we know that we are creating opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses every day. EOS BOS That is our government’s focus. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there have been discussions between the parties and I believe that if you seek it you would find unanimous consent for the following motion. EOS BOS I move:Motion
							That, at the conclusion of today's debate on the Opposition motion in the name of the Member from London--Fanshawe, all questions necessary to dispose of this motion be deemed put and a recorded division deemed requested and deferred until Monday, February 13th, 2012 at the end of Government Orders. EOS </s> BOS Does the opposition whip have the unanimous consent of the House to propose this motion?Some hon. members: Agreed. EOS BOS The Speaker: EOS BOS The House has heard the terms of the motion. EOS BOS Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed.(Motion agreed to) EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as opposition continued to build on the Conservatives' planned cuts to the cadet glider program, a gag order was sent ordering cadet corps members not to share opinions or facts on the glider program. EOS BOS We are not talking national security here. EOS BOS It is a budget cut to a program for kids. EOS BOS A clear decision to end CF delivery of the air cadet glider program was communicated to the cadet organization. EOS BOS Now, in light of the minister's statement issued today, will he confirm that the Conservatives have reversed the proposed cuts and that the air cadet glider program will continue? EOS BOS Will they confirm that they have reversed the proposed cuts— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for St. John's East. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, will he confirm that they have reversed the proposed cuts and that the air cadet glider program will continue to be delivered by the Canadian Forces as before? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think I addressed this fabrication two days ago. EOS BOS Since coming to office, our government has made increases to the cadet program each and every year. EOS BOS As I said yesterday, the cadet program is one of the finest that we have for young Canadians. EOS BOS It is a program which many Canadians, in fact some members of this House, have benefited from. EOS BOS It is a terrific program that we continue to support and will continue to invest in. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are waiting for accountability and clear answers, but I think it is too much to hope from the Liberals. EOS BOS Let us instead look at a document that does not spin as freely as the Prime Minister can. EOS BOS The Liberals' election platform states, “We will ensure that Access to Information applies to the Prime Minister's and Ministers' Offices”. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister explain which part of his own promise he failed to understand? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are improving government openness and transparency by making the most significant changes to the Access to Information Act since 1983. EOS BOS We are giving the Information Commissioner the power to order the disclosure of government information, and we are extending the scope of the act by including a legislated, proactive disclosure system for ministers' offices, the Prime Minister's Office, and the institutions that offer administrative and other support to Parliament. EOS BOS We have committed to making the government more open, more accessible and more transparent, which is exactly what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think it is entirely possible that the Prime Minister does not understand some of the things he says, but is he actually telling us today that he did not understand his own electoral platform? EOS BOS Here is the wording of the promise again, “We will ensure that Access to Information applies to the Prime Minister’s and Ministers’ Offices...”, #RealChange. EOS BOS When the Prime Minister broke his promise on changing the voting system, he blamed the opposition. EOS BOS What is his excuse this time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike what the member opposite said, we are expanding the act to include a system of legislative proactive disclosure for ministers' offices, the Prime Minister's Office, administrative institutions that support Parliament, and others. EOS BOS We are, as we always have been, raising the bar on transparency and openness with the first and significant changes to the Access to Information Act, the largest changes made since 1983. EOS BOS We continue to demonstrate to Canadians our commitment to openness and transparency, and we will keep delivering on that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the devastating effects that autism spectrum disorder has on far too many Canadians. EOS BOS Tragically, all children who have this disorder will experience social difficulties and mental health problems at some point in their lives. EOS BOS Fortunately, there is cutting-edge research going on here in Canada that will hopefully provide new and effective treatments. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our government is supporting this important research? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to supporting research that will help Canadians with autism and their families. EOS BOS That is why today we announced funding for a new chair for autism research, Dr. Jonathan Weiss from York University. EOS BOS This will not only improve our understanding of autism by looking for new approaches to treatment, it will also support the next generation of Canadian researchers. We will continue to make strategic investments in health care. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has taken any opportunity he can to criticize Europe for its inaction on the economy. EOS BOS The truth is, Europe is acting. EOS BOS However, despite the fact that the Governor of the Bank of Canada says our economy “is slowing to a crawl”, this out-of-touch Conservative government refuses to act now and create jobs in Canada. EOS BOS Canadians are tired of the government's continued inaction. EOS BOS We believe in action on this side of the House. EOS BOS We put forward a plan. EOS BOS When will the government finally implement our plan to create jobs and kickstart the Canadian economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is quite an action plan, standing and voting against anything that the government puts forward that actually will help create jobs. EOS BOS Canadians should be very fearful if that is the action plan from the NDP. EOS BOS We have continued with a plan, a jobs and growth plan from the government. EOS BOS It is working. EOS BOS In fact, so are nearly 650,000 more Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague said that everything is going well, but the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, who has a bit more credibility, said this week that the Canadian economy was weakening considerably. EOS BOS The government is not taking action to stimulate job creation. EOS BOS In the meantime, other countries are taking action. EOS BOS It takes hard work. EOS BOS Canadian families have seen enough inaction from this government. EOS BOS It is as simple as that. EOS BOS When will the government get to work to ensure that people have jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I forgot the other component of the NDP plan, and that is to tax Canadians by another $10 billion. EOS BOS We do not think that is a good plan. EOS BOS It was in the NDP platform that it campaigned on. EOS BOS I think that is why we have a majority Conservative government: because Canadians expect a plan that will help Canadians get back to work, that will help balance the deficit, and that will help all Canadians. EOS BOS That is what we are going to do. EOS BOS We hope that the NDP might see the error of its ways and actually support us on that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change has now admitted that in order to meet Paris targets, Canadian taxpayers will have to pay billions of dollars to countries like China. EOS BOS Canadians deserve to know why they will be taxed to death so their hard-earned money will be sent to major emitters, like China. EOS BOS When will the Liberal government unmuzzle the economists and come clean with Canadians about the hidden costs of this Liberal scheme? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government knows that growing our economy and protecting our environment go together. EOS BOS December is actually a good time of year to review all the progress we have made. EOS BOS In one short year, Canada played a leading role in international negotiations that led to the Paris agreement. EOS BOS We held three first ministers meetings, in contrast to the previous government, on climate change, concluding with an historic pan-Canadian framework on climate change and clean growth, which we achieved on Friday. EOS BOS We have moved forward with a number of key environmental initiatives relating to methane, coal, hydrofluorocarbons, and the pricing of carbon pollution. EOS BOS That is real change. EOS BOS That is what we promised in the last election, and we have delivered. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are no ifs, ands, or buts as to who is in charge of this slow-motion train wreck. EOS BOS The reality is that Australia has abandoned its carbon tax. EOS BOS France is not putting a price on carbon. EOS BOS Saskatchewan and Manitoba have some serious concerns about this pan-Canadian effort. EOS BOS The U.S. is our biggest ally, and it is not doing it either. EOS BOS There will be no carbon price down there. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals so keen on putting Canadian businesses at a competitive disadvantage when our economy is already struggling after a year of mismanagement under these guys? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the historic climate plan we achieved on Friday is very much focused on driving growth and driving clean jobs, middle-class jobs. EOS BOS Canadians agree. EOS BOS Let me quote from a statement put out today by 27 chief executive officers across Canada:
              
                
                  We congratulate the Prime Minister and Premiers on achieving a national plan to drive clean growth and make real progress on climate change. EOS BOS This plan includes the key elements needed to do so, including a rising price on carbon.... EOS BOS The shift to a high performance, low carbon economy is underway across Canada and around the world, and it offers tremendous opportunity for all parts of the economy. EOS BOS This kind of coordinated government leadership is critical to accelerate our progress and help us keep pace with global leaders, by catalyzing private initiative and innovation across the country. EOS BOS The government is showing tremendous leadership. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the government on driving jobs into the ground. EOS BOS Australia implemented a carbon tax, but it was forced to reverse this attack on hard-working families, as it made life unaffordable for citizens and small business. EOS BOS The United States has been clear that it is not going forward with a carbon tax. EOS BOS Canadian families are already struggling, and the Liberals are making a bad situation worse. EOS BOS When will the Liberals reverse this attack on hard-working families and quit forcing Canadian jobs to move south of the border? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that my hon. EOS BOS colleague actually consult leading and thoughtful Conservatives across Canada. EOS BOS The Manitoba government has committed to putting a price on carbon. EOS BOS Ontario Conservative leader Patrick Brown has committed to putting a price on carbon. EOS BOS Preston Manning has talked extensively about the need to put a price on carbon. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister failed to reach consensus on his climate change plan, and for good reason. EOS BOS It will hurt our economy, it will cost Canadians billions of dollars in new taxes, and it is unfair. EOS BOS The rest of the country will pay disproportionately for this new climate change plan while, in Ontario, its largest carbon emitters have received exemptions. EOS BOS Will the Liberals admit that this climate change plan and carbon tax is an absolute sham? EOS BOS It is going to cost hard-working Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars in new unnecessary taxes and will achieve absolutely nothing. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to creating a cleaner, more innovative economy that reduces emissions and protects our environment while creating well-paying jobs for the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS BOS We and the provinces are establishing a benchmark price on carbon that will help us meet our greenhouse targets while providing certainty and predictability to businesses. EOS BOS After a decade of complete inaction from the other side of the House, we are actually taking measures to improve our economy and to protect the future of our children and our grandchildren. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, first it was about inexperienced campaign workers, workers meeting the bus. EOS BOS Then the excuse was, “ EOS BOS Sorry, I'm a rookie at this kind of stuff, I don't know the rules”. EOS BOS Then out of nowhere last week the minister knew the rules. EOS BOS It was not about inexperienced campaign workers. EOS BOS He told them, “ EOS BOS Don't accept corporate donations. EOS BOS Don't be tricked, don't be fooled”. EOS BOS Then, in the same breath, he forgot to tell them that there was a spending limit. EOS BOS Is there anything else he would like to add while he is digging this hole? EOS </s> BOS I have something I would like to add, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS That member across speaks for a party that in the last month has been caught making illegal robocalls, and that has almost half a million dollars in illegal loans that have now become donations over the limit, for which it has no explanation whatsoever. EOS BOS Of course, this builds on the grand legacy the Liberals left after 13 years in office of that $40 million. EOS BOS I ask him, where is the $40 million? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage considers newspapers to be obsolete. EOS BOS If she cannot read it on a tablet, then it has outlived its usefulness. EOS BOS At a time when sources of information are multiplying, the minister is taking some away. EOS BOS Quality information is essential to a healthy democracy. EOS BOS We have a duty to support it. EOS BOS Will the minister listen to the journalistic community and institute a program or funding to support national and regional print newspapers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to send my colleague the speech that I gave at the end of September in either print or digital format. EOS BOS In that speech, I clearly stated that we are going to continue to support our local media and help them through this difficult transition so that we can retain our journalists and maintain jobs in this field across the country. EOS BOS We know that journalism lies at the heart of our democracy. EOS BOS As a government, we believe in the importance of print media, whether it is in paper or digital format. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, by introducing a Trojan Horse budget packed with amendments that have nothing to do with the budget, the Conservatives have shown their true colours. EOS BOS This budget cuts more jobs than it creates. EOS BOS It reduces seniors' benefits, provincial health funding, and food inspection. EOS BOS Why is this government so determined to pass a bill that will weaken our economy and endanger Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the context of the budget is an effort to continue the economic recovery, jobs and growth and prosperity in Canada. EOS BOS As the member opposite knows, Canada has done relatively well. EOS BOS Coming out of the great recession, we have about 700,000 net new jobs in Canada, the best job growth in any industrialized country in the G7. EOS BOS We have done rather well, but we need the long-term plan to get back to balanced budgets and have sustainable programs in the long term so Canada can maintain its record of jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians deserve better than the irresponsible changes the government is trying to quietly sneak through in this bill. EOS BOS From cuts that will affect Canada's poorest seniors the most to wide-ranging cuts that will harm Canada's multi-billion dollar arts industry to foreign aid cuts that will stop all aid to four of the world's poorest countries, this Trojan Horse budget will in fact kill more jobs than it creates. EOS BOS When will the government stop listening just to oil lobbyists and start listening to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sure the member opposite has read what the economists in Canada and elsewhere have said about the budget and how economic action plan 2012 continues Canada in the right direction toward jobs, growth and prosperity. EOS BOS Yes, there are modest spending reductions over the course of three years built into the budget. EOS BOS If hon. EOS BOS members want to see drama, they should go to the United Kingdom, or watch what the United States will be obliged to do when it tries to get its house in order. EOS BOS We never want Canada to be in that place. EOS BOS That is why we have moderate spending reductions, returning to balanced budgets in the medium term. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's north is a fundamental part of our heritage, our future, and our identity as a country. EOS BOS Our government is taking action to ensure that the north realizes its full potential, and there has been significant progress made. EOS BOS The Yukon Territory has had the capability of managing its land and resources for over 11 years now, and just this spring the Northwest Territories realized its devolution agreement by the signing of that with the Government of Canada. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development please update the House on the progress we are making to make sure the north realizes its full potential by administering its own fate and its own future? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to providing the people of Nunavut with more control over their economic and political future, including negotiating the transfer of land and resource management responsibilities. EOS BOS That is why today our government was pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Brian Dominique as the chief federal negotiator, to begin working on a devolution agreement in principle. EOS BOS This clearly demonstrates our commitment to Canada's north. EOS BOS With devolution comes the power for the people of Nunavut to make their own decisions in the area of resource management, to reach out and take control of their own destiny, and to build a strong and prosperous territory for future generations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for over three weeks now, we have been trying to get answers from the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs about his exceeding the election spending limits. EOS BOS But the minister continues to think that the law does not apply to him. EOS BOS He is content to look the other way, even though his campaign manager was rewarded with a job for circumventing the system. EOS BOS What happened to ministerial accountability? EOS BOS The minister is refusing to answer, but he must answer. EOS BOS If he is not able to supervise his own election campaign and his own employees, how can we believe for a single second that he is able to manage his own department? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has already indicated that the official agent would proactively respond to all questions, in co-operation with Elections Canada. EOS BOS [English]The New Democratic Party officials have likewise been very busy. EOS BOS On Saturday they met in Quebec to discuss whether or not they should have a provincial party, but according to a Global News story, the party president, Rebecca Blaikie, said that the decision was complicated by the fact that some Quebec New Democrats are supporters of left-wing sovereigntist parties at the provincial level. EOS BOS Could the member clear up all the complications? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is nobody in Quebec with the New Democrats who supports illegal activities, unlike those on that side. EOS BOS Now we have the member for Labrador who has been caught again. EOS BOS This time he cashed a cheque from Pennecon and then tried to cover his tracks by coming up with after-the-fact personal receipts. EOS BOS That is wrong. EOS BOS He financed his campaign with zero interest loans from his in-laws. EOS BOS That is wrong. EOS BOS He blew past the spending limit. EOS BOS That is wrong. EOS BOS He hid $18,000 in flights. EOS BOS That is wrong. EOS BOS He has been hiding out from accountability besides, which is totally wrong. EOS BOS I would like to ask the member, will he stop acting like a turtle, act like a minister of the Crown and stand up and take accountability? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, at no time did I suggest that the supporters of the NDP were breaking the law when they contributed to the separatist cause in Quebec. EOS BOS That is not a criminal offence; it is a political position. EOS BOS All I ask is for the hon. EOS BOS member who has contributed to that position on 29 occasions to rise in this House and say whether or not he is a federalist. EOS BOS What is against the law is the $340,000 of illegal union money that the member has been defending ever since his party accepted it. EOS BOS Shame on him. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday I attended the Military Police Complaints Commission hearings and met Sheila Fynes, the mother of a deceased soldier. EOS BOS I saw first-hand the impact his suicide is having on her. EOS BOS Compounding this enormous sadness was a 14-month delay in releasing the suicide note, leaving the family to wonder and to question the reasons for his death. EOS BOS The note included his hope to have a small, private funeral, a wish that went unfulfilled because the government did not release the note. EOS BOS At what point in 2008 was the minister first made aware of the suicide note? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, to say the least, the loss of Corporal Langridge to suicide a very tragic case. EOS BOS I have met personally with Ms. Sheila Fynes. EOS BOS All of this very unsettling and sad saga is playing out before a Military Police Complaints Commission, which is looking into the details of this matter. EOS BOS This matter is now before an arm's-length tribunal. EOS BOS I find it unfortunate that the member opposite has tried to politicize this before the House of Commons while the matter is yet to be determined by an arm's-length body, the Military Police Complaints Commission. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what is unfortunate is that the minister decided to attack instead of explain. EOS BOS (1440)[Translation]Corporal Steve Stoesz has defied orders and is courageously speaking out about the terrible state of mental health care services in the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS He said:
							[English]“The country I fought for now has broken me.”
							[Translation]Meanwhile EOS BOS , the minister is cutting funding to programs to prevent suicide and to help soldiers overcome depression. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact we continue to increase our mental health services across the country. EOS BOS Let me quote Colonel Jean-Robert Bernier, who spoke last week. EOS BOS He said that since 2006, the military health budget has grown by more than $100 million, and $38.6 million is spent annually just to provide mental health care and preventative programs to the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS Is there more we can do? EOS BOS Absolutely. EOS BOS Are we continuing to make those investments to support our men and women who are suffering from post-traumatic stress? EOS BOS Indeed we are. EOS BOS We are working every day to ensure that those services are available. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the government about the business for this week and next week. EOS BOS However, you may recall that before we rose for the Christmas break, I asked the government if it would consider a take-note debate regarding the job situation in Canada and, specifically, the job losses in the energy sector. EOS BOS Again, I ask the House leader if she would please let us know the business for this week and next week, and when we will be able to have that important take-note debate. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, we will continue the debate that we began this morning on the Conservative Party's motion. EOS BOS Tomorrow, we will begin the report stage debate of Bill C-30 on the Canada-European Union comprehensive economic and trade agreement. EOS BOS Monday, we will resume debate of that bill. 
							[English]Next week, we will also continue the second reading debate of Bill C-36, an act to amend the Statistics Act, and Bill C-31, an act to implement the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Ukraine. EOS BOS Next Thursday, February 9, shall be an allotted day. EOS BOS Last, there have been consultations among the parties and I believe you would find agreement for the following motion. EOS BOS I move:MotionThat a take-note debate on the subject of job losses in the energy sector take place, pursuant to Standing Order 53.1, on Wednesday, February 8, 2017, and that, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice of the House, (a) any member rising to speak during the debate my indicate to the Chair that he or she will dividing his or her time with another member; and (b) no quorum calls, dilatory motions, or requests for unanimous consent shall be received by the Chair. EOS
BOS Does the hon. EOS BOS government House leader have the unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion?Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS BOS The Deputy Speaker: EOS BOS The House has the terms of the motion. EOS BOS Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed.(Motion agreed to) EOS </s> BOS The Chair has received notice of a question of privilege from the hon. EOS BOS member for Red Deer— EOS BOS Lacombe, and we'll go to that now. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Red Deer— EOS BOS Lacombe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General found that the Conservatives are failing to ensure that $2.9 billion of Canada's development assistance is meeting the criteria under the Official Development Assistance Accountability Act. EOS BOS The accountability act is the law; it is not an option. EOS BOS This is part of a continuing pattern of mismanagement under the minister. EOS BOS Does he agree with the Auditor General's findings, and will he commit to complying with the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are complying with the law and we are doing it in a very responsible way. EOS BOS However, we do accept the recommendations of the Auditor General in his report, and our government will continue to demonstrate how Canadian taxpayer investments are achieving tangible results for those most in need. EOS BOS We are competent, capable and are doing exactly what we are supposed to do to ensure that Canadian taxpayers are equally served to those in greater need, for which the money is dedicated. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is unable to abide by the law when it comes to handing out international aid. EOS BOS What is worse, according to the Auditor General, CIDA's reports are not transparent and the annual development report is not specific enough. EOS BOS The auditor confirmed what we have been saying all along: the minister is not running his department properly. EOS BOS What concrete action will the minister take to abide by the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, that is a figment of the hon. member's imagination. EOS BOS I do not think I need any lessons from that member about upholding the law, which we are in fact doing in each and every circumstance. EOS BOS Our efforts on the international level of assistance and development are certainly well entrenched. EOS BOS We are receiving appreciation from countries and others who are receiving our aid. EOS BOS Obviously there are some issues that we need to deal with, and we will, but to say we are not observing the law or acting otherwise is irresponsible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last October the government supported a Liberal motion to implement a national suicide prevention strategy. EOS BOS Eight months later, it has done nothing except cut suicide prevention programs for Inuit and aboriginal youth and the armed forces. EOS BOS Today the Mental Health Commission of Canada recommended prevention of mental illness as one of six core strategic directions. EOS BOS Does the Minister of Health comprehend that suicide prevention literally saves lives? EOS BOS Will she proceed urgently to develop a national suicide prevention strategy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, we welcomed the release of the Mental Health Commission's strategy this morning. EOS BOS As the opposition member knows, this is important work of the commission, and we continue to work with the provinces and territories in the rollout. EOS BOS That is why we have committed to long-term stable funding to the provinces and territories. EOS BOS The funding arrangements will see that health transfers reach a record high of $40 billion, and provinces and territories will be able to adjust it to priorities in their areas. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, in a recent National Post article, B.C. journalist Terry Glavin raised concerns about the extent of Chinese ownership in the oil sands. EOS BOS He pointed out that Sinopec, which is owned by the Communist Party of China and is the seventh largest corporation in the world, plus PetroChina and a number of others now have a $20 billion stake in direct ownership of the oil sands. EOS BOS He raised this question: “Just how Sinopec became co-author of” the Prime Minister's “new foreign policy and energy strategy isn't a question any of us are supposed to be asking”. EOS BOS Well, I am asking. EOS BOS How did this happen without public debate? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the premise of the member's question is just rubbish. EOS BOS Our government is concentrating on what is important to Canadians, which is the environment and economic growth. EOS BOS The fact is the oil sands are responsible for over 100,000 direct jobs across Canada. EOS BOS That number will grow to 700,000 jobs. EOS BOS That is how many jobs the opposition, the NDP member opposite and the Liberals say no to every time they oppose the development of the Canadian economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Ontario Power Generation just released another report to try to justify its dangerous plan to bury and abandon nuclear waste next to the Great Lakes. EOS BOS These lakes are already under threat and attack by President Trump. EOS BOS They are a fragile ecosystem. EOS BOS The government has a duty to protect them. EOS BOS They are our freshwater source and home to a trillion-dollar industry. EOS BOS The U.S. Congress and U.S. Senate oppose this plan. EOS BOS Over 200 municipalities oppose this plan. EOS BOS Environmentalists, hunters, and anglers all advise to reject this plan. EOS BOS Who is the Liberals' adviser on this, Homer J. Simpson? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to ensuring environmental risks linked to development are addressed before projects proceed. EOS BOS After considering the joint review panel's report, on February 18, 2016, I requested that OPG, the proponent of the deep geological repository project, provide additional information about possible alternative sites before making an environmental assessment decision. EOS BOS A final decision will be made based on science, evidence, and public input. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I face the difficult task of addressing something rather unpleasant. EOS BOS In recent years, I had the honour of occupying a role that allowed me to effectively represent Quebec and its regions. EOS BOS I had the honour of being the longest serving minister of Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. EOS BOS I also had the honour of being the political lieutenant for Quebec for former prime minister Stephen Harper. EOS BOS Both of those roles have been eliminated. EOS BOS Now the Liberals like to claim that their 40 members from that province are standing up for Quebec's regions, but what I am hearing is that we did more with five members than they are doing with 40. EOS BOS Why did the Liberals take away the Quebec regions' right to be heard through those positions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the member for his service to his community, to the House, and to all Canadians for many years. EOS BOS We certainly do not see eye to eye on many issues, but one thing we do agree on is that we must be there at all times to defend our values and our communities. EOS BOS I do so proudly as a Quebecker, just as he has. EOS BOS Everyone in the House will miss him when he goes, because he has made us work harder and more fervently to defend our communities and our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this infamous $90,000 cheque issued by the Prime Minister's former chief of staff is at the heart of Mike Duffy's trial for fraud and corruption, which gets under way tomorrow. EOS BOS The question on everyone's mind is quite simple. EOS BOS How is it that the guy who received the cheque gets charged, but the one who signed it gets away with it? EOS BOS That makes no sense. EOS BOS Where there is corruption, there has to be a corrupter. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister think that the Director of Public Prosecutions should launch an investigation to determine whether charges should also be laid against Nigel Wright? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I just want to congratulate the RCMP for the very thorough work that they did. As you know, Mr. Speaker, this case is before the courts right now, and we will let the courts make their decision. EOS BOS At the same time, we know that the NDP is facing a similar investigation, with over $1.5 million of potentially illegal funds that it used from taxpayers to support offices in provinces where it has no members of Parliament. I hope that the NDP will do the right thing and repay taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that I have never given a cheque to a senator. EOS BOS The Conservatives say that they are tough on crime, but not when their friends are involved. EOS BOS I should point out that they just let Mike Tyson into the country, even though he is a convicted rapist. EOS BOS But I digress. EOS BOS Former Conservative Senator Mike Duffy is now before the courts, but the Conservative staff who were up to their necks in this scandal are doing extraordinarily well. EOS BOS Corruption is like doing the tango—it takes two. EOS BOS When are the Conservatives going to clean house? EOS BOS When are they going to stop protecting their friends? EOS BOS When are they going to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to launch an investigation into Nigel Wright? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, he and a number of the members of his caucus cut cheques to support illegal offices in provinces where they actually have no members of Parliament, but again, we cannot forget that this is the exact same member who cut 29 separate cheques to a party that wants to break up Canada. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we will continue to defend Canada. EOS BOS We will continue to do the things that have led Canada to be one of the most prosperous nations in the world. EOS BOS We will continue to cut taxes. EOS BOS We will continue to do what is right for families, because that is what Canadians' priorities are. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Director of Public Prosecutions was created in the wake of the Liberal sponsorship scandal to ensure independent justice when the Prime Minister's own office is involved. EOS BOS Now tomorrow, Mike Duffy is going up on 30 charges, including receiving a bribe, a bribe that involved the Prime Minister's staff, yet the Director of Public Prosecutions was not consulted. EOS BOS The DPP's mandate says intervening and advising law enforcement agencies on matters relating to prosecutions and advising the RCMP. EOS BOS Does the minister agree that the Nigel Wright case would be within the mandate of the Director of Public Prosecutions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as members know, this government does not direct the Director of Public Prosecutions. EOS BOS It is an independent office, and it governs itself on its own. EOS BOS Again, we are very confident. EOS BOS The RCMP did a great job of this, and I want to commend them for the work they did. EOS BOS It is in front of the courts, and we will allow that decision to be made by the courts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week Hurricane Sandy tore through the U.S. causing enormous suffering and $20 billion in damages. EOS BOS I then received the government's two-sentence answer to my order paper question regarding disaster risk reduction and preparedness in Canada. EOS BOS Apparently my answer requires “extensive manual research and analysis”.Why has the research not been done? EOS BOS Why did the Minister of Public Safety not deign to answer any of my questions, which are fundamental to the health and safety of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us just put that into context. EOS BOS The question that was posed by the member cost taxpayers in excess of $1,300, just to examine whether an answer was possible. EOS BOS In order to— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Public Safety has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the question cost taxpayers in excess of $1,300 just to examine whether an answer was possible. EOS BOS In order to answer the 55 subquestions, it would cost untold tens of thousands of dollars. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday in committee the former chief electoral officer, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, said that vouching is fundamental to our democracy and our electoral system. EOS BOS Can the Minister of State for Democratic Reform tell us whether he agrees with the expert who oversaw our electoral system for 17 years? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we simply believe that people should bring with them a piece of identification that shows who they are and where they live to prove that they are eligible to vote. EOS BOS That is normal and I believe that Canadians think it is reasonable. EOS BOS There are 39 approved means of identification. EOS BOS That gives Canadians a great deal of choice. EOS BOS We are going to require that Elections Canada inform Canadians of the approved pieces of identification they can use. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one of the things that the government's Bill C-23 will do is increase the annual political contribution limit by 25%, bringing it to $1,500 per person. EOS BOS The other major impact of Bill C-23 will be to exempt from campaign expenses the amounts spent to solicit donations from people who have made contributions in the past. EOS BOS Can the minister explain where he got those ideas? EOS BOS Can he quote even one independent expert who believes that these measures will strengthen our democracy and reduce the influence of money in politics? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the expert who has already shown that fundraising expenses should be excluded from campaign expenses is the same expert who wrote the NDP policy. EOS BOS According to the NDP's own rules, all expenses related to fundraising are excluded from the campaign expenses. EOS BOS The principle is that fundraising is not a means of campaigning. EOS BOS The NDP and the Liberals make that distinction in their rules. EOS BOS We are doing so in law. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, some time ago, the Chief Electoral Officer formed an advisory board of notable Canadians like Michael Wilson, Preston Manning, and Sheila Fraser. EOS BOS Given the government's attacks on the CEO, will the Minister of State for Democratic Reform assure Canadians that the Treasury Board would never deny requests under Bill C-23's proposed subsection 20(1) to cover costs associated with engaging these advisors on a temporary basis?Will the government agree to amend this deeply flawed bill to make that change? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, not only does the government support the Advisory Committee of Political Parties that currently exists, but we are in fact also going to make it a statutory body so that the CEO of Elections Canada can consult with all political parties, not just those recognized in the House of Commons, before he issues new interpretations. EOS BOS This will allow for interpretations of law and advanced rulings to be consistent so that all parties play by the same rules. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservative management of international affairs is getting more embarrassing by the day. EOS BOS Canada has been disengaging more and more since its disgraceful failure to obtain a seat on the UN Security Council, and major world powers have been handling global peace and security in the meantime. EOS BOS Recognizing that the Conservatives' bad policies are hurting our chances, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday that Canada would not make another attempt to get a seat. EOS BOS Why is he ducking his international responsibilities? EOS BOS When will things change? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's principled foreign policy is not for sale for a Security Council seat. EOS BOS We are aggressively working on humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable, including Syria. EOS BOS We are taking real leadership when it comes to standing up against the evil that is Iran. EOS BOS No one is standing up more strongly against the regime in Colombo, Sri Lanka, than this Prime Minister and this government. EOS BOS Canadians can finally be proud of their government on foreign policy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he is fine to go along and get along with the dictators in Bahrain, but he will not fight for a seat on the Security Council. EOS BOS Every priority of Canada's foreign policy, from a nuclear Iran to chemical weapons in Syria, is handled at the Security Council. EOS BOS This minister is admitting that he will not even try to win back our seat at the most powerful decision-making body in the world. EOS BOS Does he want to be known as the minister who just gave up on Canada's most important tool to influence global affairs? EOS BOS Is that what he is saying: give up, quit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will say what I am going to give up; I am going to give up on this critic. EOS BOS This government took the principled stand to close our embassy, and break off relations with Iran and to declare it a terrorist state. EOS BOS This member came out against them, only to be undermined and counteracted by his own leader. EOS BOS His own leader supported this government, and he did not. EOS BOS This government is always prepared to stand up to do what is right, to speak up on behalf of Canadian values, to speak up on behalf of Canadian interests. EOS BOS That is something that the New Democrats will never understand. EOS BOS They are with the go along to get along crowd. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian businesses pay $5 billion a year just to process credit card payments. EOS BOS These costs are then passed on to consumers. EOS BOS Now, credit card companies have announced that fees are set to increase again, this time by 33%. EOS BOS This will have a major impact on small businesses in Canada, and it underscores how the government's toothless voluntary code of conduct has failed to reign in credit card fees. EOS BOS Why do Conservatives refuse to regulate this industry, and protect consumers and small businesses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, imagine what a $21 billion carbon tax would add to the cost of businesses. EOS BOS This is certainly something that has concerned businesses and it has concerned our government. EOS BOS That is why we put in place a code of conduct that, if I recall, the NDP did not even support. EOS BOS We need to make sure that businesses know exactly what they are signing on to when they sign agreements with the credit card companies, as do consumers. EOS BOS We would appreciate a little support in the House in protecting businesses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, small and medium-sized businesses are not protected by the code. EOS BOS The Conservatives’ voluntary code of conduct does not work. EOS BOS In addition to a 33% increase in processing fees, the cost of foreign-card transactions would double in 2013. EOS BOS Moreover, Visa will be issuing ultra-premium cards for frequent users, which will cost merchants even more in fees. EOS BOS There is no end to it. EOS BOS The Conservatives must take action, at last, to protect small business and stop hiding behind their so-called code of conduct. EOS BOS When will there be regulations to protect the profit margins of Canada’s small and medium-sized businesses from abuse by the credit card companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, we do have a code of conduct that was put in place, with no help from anyone on the other side of the House, that actually does put in a lot of protections for businesses. EOS BOS The debit and credit card protectors must be upfront about fees. EOS BOS The businesses now know that, whereas they did not before. EOS BOS They also have to know upfront what the rates are. EOS BOS Small businesses can actually cancel contracts without penalty if those fees change. EOS BOS Those are common sense changes in the code of conduct, not common sense enough for dippers, I guess. EOS
BOS Talking about getting the house in order, Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives should start with the environment. EOS BOS There are 22,000 contaminated sites in Canada posing risks to human health, from abandoned mines to leaky fuel tanks. EOS BOS Canadians expect the government to take action on these sites. EOS BOS The environment commissioner has identified a half billion dollar funding shortfall. EOS BOS That is less than half of the cost of the meeting in Muskoka. EOS BOS Why have the Conservatives failed to make the cleanup of thousands of contaminated sites a priority? EOS BOS Why have they failed Canadian families yet again? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think it is wonderful the NDP has finally discovered the challenge this country faces with regard to contaminated sites. EOS BOS The commissioner's report also notes that 42% of the inventory of contaminated sites have been cleaned, remediated by February this year. EOS BOS The 15-year federal contaminated sites program is only at its midway point. EOS BOS We will continue to work to address the situation on all of the major contaminated sites in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what a crock. EOS BOS According to the commissioner, those sites are the legacy of poor planning, inadequate environmental assessment and weak environmental regulations. EOS BOS The Conservatives are using their budget bill to force Canadians to accept changes that scuttle environmental protection for Canadian families. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop their constant attacks on environmental regulation? EOS BOS When will they start protecting the health of Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think that our colleague needs some help reading the report. EOS BOS [English]The report indicates that the commissioner says the Government of Canada is making good progress in addressing contaminated sites across the country. EOS BOS Through the federal contaminated sites action plan, the Government of Canada is addressing harmful effects of past practices and protecting Canadians and our environment for future generations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative vendetta against environmental groups is becoming clearer. EOS BOS Tides Canada is fighting to protect the environment, yet it is being attacked and its activities are being scrutinized by Revenue Canada. EOS BOS Rather than cleaning house at Revenue Canada, which is mired in allegations of corruption and is producing questionable videos, the Conservatives are intent on finding fault with environmental groups. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government does understand that registered charities are an important part of our Canadian society, and we do encourage Canadians to donate generously. EOS BOS CRA does enforce the Income Tax Act free of political direction, specific files or interference, and we expect CRA to undertake compliance and enforcement activities, as appropriate, to enforce Canadian laws. EOS BOS We are taking action so that Canadians can be sure that charities are using their resources appropriately. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Tides Canada is a respected organization that does tremendous work in environmental causes and social— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for Brossard— EOS BOS La Prairie has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Tides Canada is a respected organization that does tremendous work in environmental and social causes, but the Conservatives are targeting Tides Canada and treating people who disagree with their reckless environmental policies like criminals. EOS BOS The government is using the Canada Revenue Agency to attack charities that disagree with the Conservative Party line. EOS BOS When are the Conservatives are going to stop this outrageous war on Canada's environmental groups? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all organizations are subject to Canadian law. EOS BOS We expect that those organizations will be in compliance with Canadian law. EOS BOS Canadians want to ensure that when they donate to charities, those charitable resources will be used for the purpose they were intended. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, now is the time to tackle environmental challenges, not attack environmental groups. EOS BOS The figures speak for themselves: in February, six years after the Conservatives were first elected, only two regulations had been put in place to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation industry and no regulations had been put in place for the oil and gas industry. EOS BOS What a coincidence. EOS BOS And yet the Conservatives committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 17% by 2020. EOS BOS Given their irresponsible choices, they will not even be able to meet their own extremely low targets. EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives not have a credible, costed plan to protect the environment and the health of future generations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said any number of times in the House, we do have a plan, and that plan is working sector by sector. EOS BOS We began with the transportation sector, which accounts for 24% of our annual greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS We are about to bring down final regulations for the coal-fired electricity sector. EOS BOS We are in consultations now with the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS We will continue and we will hit those 2020 targets. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, both Conservative and Liberal governments have downloaded responsibility for Saskatchewan's environmentally critical grasslands without any concern for their future. EOS BOS These grasslands are unique ecological heritage sites. EOS BOS They act as important carbon sinks and are home to rare and threatened species. EOS BOS Now the government is considering giving away the last of these grasslands in southwestern Saskatchewan and ending the environmental protection they receive. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Environment and Climate Change commit today to create a new national wildlife area to preserve these ecosystems for future generations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I take very seriously the obligation to protect our natural environment. EOS BOS I am committed to working with the member on this issue to find a resolution. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has proven that he is good at misdirection, rhetoric and personal insults. EOS BOS What he is not so good at is giving straight answers. EOS BOS The minister hurls accusations of fearmongering, but the biggest source of fearmongering is the minister's refusal to clear the air on base closures. EOS BOS The minister is the only who can put military families and their communities at ease. EOS BOS Will he please stand in his place and assure military base communities that they have nothing to fear? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, methinks he doth protest too much. EOS BOS When it comes to fearmongering, he is referring to a report that was late. EOS BOS The October 2011 departmental directive, which he is referring to, does not speak of base closures. EOS BOS What it does reference in an accompanying news article is a Liberal senator musing about base closures. EOS BOS The only person who is causing alarm in the military community, their families and the country, and misleading Canadians about base closures, is the member opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of the directive to which the minister refers. EOS BOS It says:We will also reduce portfolio size, footprint and associated overhead costs by consolidating Defence operations and programs to fewer operational sites. EOS BOS Again, does this mean base closures, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is sound and fury signifying nothing. EOS BOS Let me be clear about what the NDP members are up to, and we have seen this before. EOS BOS It is an old opposition tactic: create a crisis, panic people, put fearmongering out there among military families, and then, when it does not happen, claim credit. EOS BOS That is what they are up to. EOS BOS The member opposite is simply trying to create a crisis that does not exist. EOS BOS The NDP does not support the military, it does not support the investments and that is unfortunate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is close to passing Canada's all-time per capita spending record, but unlike his predecessors, his out-of-control spending is without a global recession or a large-scale military conflict. EOS BOS The Liberals spend and spend, while nickel-and-diming everyday Canadians and forcing tax hikes on the most vulnerable. EOS BOS The deficit is already three times what the Liberals promised, and they have no plan to get it under control. EOS BOS Can the minister tell Canadians when the budget will be balanced? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear with this House: we have a plan, and that plan is working. EOS BOS What we have seen over the course of the last year and a half is that our economy is doing significantly better. EOS BOS Over the last three quarters, as an example, we have 3.5% real growth. EOS BOS More than a quarter of a million full-time jobs have been created over the last year. EOS BOS What we are seeing is a real improvement in our economy, which is helping families across this country. EOS BOS That is exactly what we have set out to do: make a real difference for Canadians, today and tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not an answer. EOS BOS Former parliamentary budget watchdog Kevin Page said the Liberal spending patterns are like his weekend golf swing: loose and all over the place. EOS BOS Worse, Page said Canada's fiscal analysis is among the weakest in the G7. EOS BOS The Liberals' only plan is to slap even more taxes on Canadians who already cannot afford it. EOS BOS The Liberals spend billions of dollars overseas, hundreds of thousands of dollars on big, self-centred perks and cardboard cut-outs. EOS BOS Their priorities are out of whack. EOS BOS It is ridiculous. EOS BOS When will the Liberals finally be responsible, keep their word, and stop risking the economic futures of young Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reason the IMF and the OECD look at Canada and say we are making a real difference is that they can see the impact we are actually having on young Canadians: creating jobs for people, more than 250,000 full-time jobs over the course of the last year and a half. EOS BOS That is the best record in many years. EOS BOS That is exactly what we set out to do. EOS BOS We are seeing better economic outcomes today. EOS BOS What that is going to prove is that we are showing real benefits for Canadians today and tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Service Canada Centre in Rimouski currently has a 25% vacancy rate. EOS BOS The Conservatives now want to move the employment insurance processing centre to the Minister of Industry's riding. EOS BOS With that move, the vacancy rate will increase to 75% and this government will waste $1.27 million until the lease expires in 2018.Given that there is a backlog of more than 80,000 employment insurance claims in Quebec, would it not be smarter to keep the office in Rimouski open to address the clear lack of resources? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times, we are in the process of modernizing and automating the employment insurance system to ensure that Canadians can receive their benefits as quickly as possible. EOS BOS Modernizing the system is going to take three years. EOS BOS We have a three-year plan to consolidate everything. EOS BOS It is part of our ongoing plan to improve services. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the F-35 report released yesterday by the Conservatives on the public accounts committee is a total whitewash. EOS BOS It does not reflect the evidence that was heard and ignores the problems identified by the Auditor General in his report. EOS BOS The Conservative report does not identify why these failures happened and it does not even place blame. EOS BOS So let us give them another chance. EOS BOS Will the government finally admit that the process for buying the F-35s was flawed and mismanaged from the time the government signed on in 2006 until today? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the report reflects the testimony that was heard in committee. EOS BOS That testimony was given in an open and public forum. EOS BOS We accept the Auditor General's recommendation. EOS BOS We have implemented a seven-point plan to deal with his recommendation. EOS BOS No replacement aircraft will be purchased until the work is done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor General have shown that, several weeks before the last election, the Conservative cabinet knew that its F-35 estimates were wrong. EOS BOS It concealed $10 billion in costs. EOS BOS However, at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the Conservatives tried to pretend that none of that was true. EOS BOS Instead of trying to rewrite the Auditor General's report, and history, why do the Conservatives not start by being transparent and honest about the F-35s? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the amount of oversight and due diligence that is being applied to this file is unprecedented. EOS BOS Since the Auditor General's report came out, this government has established a secretariat made up of senior members, including also independent members, one of whom is a very well respected former auditor general of Canada, Denis Desautels, to oversee this process. EOS BOS The funding has been frozen for the acquisition to replace the CF-18s, and we are looking at all options on the table at this point. EOS BOS We will not purchase any new aircraft until this due diligence is completed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the F-35 secretariat's seven-point plan is useless unless the air force's statement of operational requirements is not amended. EOS BOS The statement of requirements was written for Lockheed Martin, with its F-35, the only company that qualifies for the contract. EOS BOS Therefore, it is important to know if the Conservatives and the National Fighter Procurement Secretariat will be working with the same requirements. EOS BOS If that is the case, will these requirements be revised to allow for an objective assessment and the consideration of other aircraft? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, the level of oversight and transparency on this acquisition is unprecedented. EOS BOS We are not going to purchase any replacements for the CF-18 until all of this due diligence is completed. EOS BOS I have told the member previously of a full options analysis, which is a full evaluation of all choices, not simply a refresh. EOS BOS When it comes to the statement of requirements, the review of options will not be constrained by the previous statement of requirements. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the only thing less convincing than that worn-out response is the silence of the Minister of National Defence on this question. EOS BOS It is, after all, his department that is conducting this so-called options analysis. EOS BOS The minister will know that the Conservative whitewash of a report did not even deal with the Auditor General's finding that the statement of requirements had been wired to select the F-35. EOS BOS He will know, as we all do, that this options analysis cannot be real unless those requirements have been amended. EOS BOS Could the minister assure us that the requirements to replace the CF-18 have been changed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said previously, the options analysis is a full evaluation of choices, not simply a refresh of the work that was done before. EOS BOS That review of options will not be constrained by the previous statement of requirements. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are getting no real answers from the Minister of Public Works and have no taking of responsibility by the Minister of National Defence for the mess that he has caused with the F-35 fiasco. EOS BOS Meanwhile, reservists are being turned away from military clinics and still discriminated against in benefit entitlements for lost limbs four years after the ombudsman recommended changes. EOS BOS We have a failure to implement, or only partly implement, eight of twelve recommendations the minister said he agreed to four years ago. EOS BOS Will the minister take responsibility for that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member has finally read the report. I have had the report. EOS BOS What he would know is that, in fact, 10 of the 12 recommendations have been actioned. EOS BOS With respect to the remaining recommendations, there is certainly need for further action. EOS BOS It is unacceptable that there would be inequity with respect to ill and injured soldiers. EOS BOS We will be moving forward on these recommendations as soon as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 800,000 children are living in poverty on that record. EOS BOS When we say it is okay for children to live in poverty, we are putting them on the road to lifelong health problems. EOS BOS We are stifling the growth of our children and their ability to live healthy lives and reach their full potential. EOS BOS Today, as I said, 800,000 Canadian children live in poverty. EOS BOS This is a national shame. EOS BOS When will the government finally take action to help our children grow up into healthy adults? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, the child poverty rate in Canada is less than half what it was under the Liberal government. EOS BOS We are very proud of that. EOS BOS It is thanks to many of the things we have done. EOS BOS The economic action plan has resulted in over 820,000 net new jobs. EOS BOS That helps parents take care of families. EOS BOS The Canada child tax benefit and the universal child care benefit alone have helped 3.5 million families find their way out of poverty, not to mention the benefits of the working income tax benefit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, no economic plan can ever be successful when so many kids are left behind. EOS BOS According to Campaign 2000's latest report, one in seven children is living in poverty. EOS BOS This is completely unacceptable, and it is a preventable tragedy. EOS BOS We all know what needs to be done, but the Conservatives lack the will to even try. EOS BOS When will the government finally adopt a national strategy to reduce poverty and allow children and their families to live with dignity? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what our goal has been and continues to be. EOS BOS In fact, we have taken action toward it, not just talked about it. EOS BOS We have taken concrete action. EOS BOS We have introduced the universal child care benefit that helps a million and a half families. EOS BOS We introduced the child tax benefit, the child tax credit, the working income tax benefit. EOS BOS All of these have helped lift people out of poverty. EOS BOS There are 225,000 fewer children living in poverty in this country than in the last year under the Liberals, but sadly, all these things that have helped young people in Canada were voted against by the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the dictionary definition of consultation is “the act or instance of consulting, to seek information or advice from someone”. EOS BOS Sending a letter with the name of just one candidate is not consulting; it is imposing a choice. EOS BOS Giving the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics one hour with the candidate for the position of Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner does not show openness; it limits the discussion. EOS BOS If the Liberals really wanted to consult the opposition, why did they wait until the very last minute to do so? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, six months ago, early this summer, we consulted the opposition members. EOS BOS We asked them exactly what kind of concerns they had, whom we should talk to, and which communities should be involved in choosing who the next officers of Parliament should be. EOS BOS This was a commitment we made regarding a process we were developing specifically to ensure greater transparency and openness. EOS BOS We are proud to have done so much consultation with the opposition members, and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear here. EOS BOS It is not like the Liberals do not know what consultation with other parties looks like. EOS BOS They did consult the opposition before appointing the Supreme Court justice recently. EOS BOS However, they consistently fail to consult on appointments for officers of Parliament. EOS BOS These watchdogs do not work for Liberals; they work for all of Parliament, and we represent all Canadians. EOS BOS Therefore, when will the Prime Minister drop his tired talking points, keep the promise to be open and accountable, and commit right now to follow the right process, the legal process, for these appointments? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his comments and for contributing to the Supreme Court appointment process. EOS BOS As he mentioned, it is a very good one. EOS BOS However, I want to correct him in that we did, for example, on the Commissioner of Lobbying and the Commissioner of Official Languages, reach out to the opposition parties back in June to talk about the stakeholders they wanted, the communities they thought we would involve, how they felt the appointment process should go. EOS BOS We were happy to consult them then. EOS BOS We are happy to be open, transparent, and engaging throughout the process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, you may recall that last week I asked the government House leader if we would have an opportunity to have a supply day so that we could discuss some of the important issues that are affecting Canadians. EOS BOS We know what we are all hearing about, so this week we asked the government, because it had not given us any opposition days over the last two weeks, if we could possibly have a take-note debate. EOS BOS At this point in the last Parliament, we had already had nine take-note debates, whereas in our current Parliament we have had only two, so there was a reason to grant us the take-note debate. EOS BOS That was not allowed, so we have had no opportunity. EOS BOS Basically, members of Parliament have been completely shut out of the consultation process on these tax changes that are so fiercely impacting and concerning Canadians right across the country. EOS BOS I would ask the government House leader if she or her representative would be able to tell us what the upcoming business is and if we would be able to have a supply day so we we can discuss some of these important issues. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleague across the way will be happy with what we are about to say. 
              We will continue today with second reading of Bill C-47, the Arms Trade Treaty. EOS BOS When the debate is completed, we will then proceed with Bill C-55, the protection of Canada's marine and coastal areas. EOS BOS Tomorrow we will return to Bill C-55. EOS BOS The business for Monday and Wednesday next week will be Bill C-48, the oil tanker moratorium bill. EOS BOS Tuesday and Thursday shall be allotted days. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Finance met with his provincial counterparts. EOS BOS What did he talk about? EOS BOS Taxing marijuana. EOS BOS Wow. EOS BOS What a way to help society. EOS BOS That sort of thing is pretty low on Canadians' list of priorities. EOS BOS I will be a good team player and recognize that my friend, the Minister of Finance, has a particular expertise when it comes to taxes. EOS BOS He invented the Liberal carbon tax and he raised taxes on alcohol, the Friday and Saturday night tax. EOS BOS He has also done many other things, like doing away with certain tax credits. EOS BOS Is taxing marijuana really a good thing for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have very important goals when it comes to cannabis. EOS BOS We want to put criminals out of business and we want a system that protects children. EOS BOS Those are our two goals. EOS BOS What is more, it is very important to keep taxes very low. EOS BOS That way there will be fewer criminals in the system. EOS BOS That is very important. EOS BOS That is our plan, and the situation will be better in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there were four muggings of students for their phones, from one school, in my riding last week. EOS BOS Cellphone thefts have doubled in Toronto over the past three years, and this is a growing problem in high schools across the country. EOS BOS Carriers are trying to track and deactivate stolen cellphones, but they need help from Parliament. EOS BOS They want to make it illegal to tamper with serial numbers. EOS BOS My private member's Bill C-482 does exactly that. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives not serious about removing the incentive to steal cellphones in the first place? EOS BOS Why will they not support our smart-on-crime bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association recently announced that it would work with industry to eliminate this problem, and our government supports it. EOS BOS We hope the NDP will support our policies as well. EOS BOS As far as wireless services are concerned, we will have a fourth player across the country in order to offer affordable prices, better competition and better choices for consumers. EOS BOS Instead of talking out of both sides of their mouths, the NDP members are encouraged to support these measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives like to pull out all the stops when there is a photo op, but when the cameras disappear, they completely ignore our veterans. EOS BOS In fact, 70% of the families of veterans who apply to the government for help with funeral expenses are turned down. EOS BOS Those who receive government assistance are only given $3,600, even though funeral expenses are often more than double that amount. EOS BOS Why have the Conservatives abandoned these families in their hour of need? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has enormous respect for the men and women who risk their lives for our country. EOS BOS That is why, every day, members rise to support the measures we put in place for our veterans. EOS BOS I am obviously referring to Conservative members, because the NDP are all talk. EOS BOS The funeral and burial program is provided to veterans through the Last Post Fund. EOS BOS It is provided to all veterans in need who have been injured in the line of duty. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is patently false. EOS BOS The Last Post Fund does not supply the needs of all veterans. EOS BOS The fact is that we asked last week in the House of Commons when the government would ensure it for every single hero of our country who wore the uniform. EOS BOS When veterans pass on, it is the final chance that a grateful nation has to thank them and their families for their service. EOS BOS I would like to ask the minister again, does he believe that every veteran who serves this country deserves a proper and dignified burial service? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, for six years we have improved the quality of life and services provided to veterans. EOS BOS We have heard no on the other side. EOS BOS Opposition members sit on their hands when it comes time to do things for veterans. EOS BOS Regarding the funeral and burial program, this is an important program delivered by the Last Post Fund to all injured veterans in need. EOS BOS We will keep improving all the services we provide to veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' lack of respect for democracy has reached a new low.We were all concerned to see that a journalist from the Selkirk Record lost her job because a Conservative MP deviated from the Prime Minister's official talking points on Nexen. EOS BOS Freedom of the press is a fundamental pillar of a strong democracy. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives refusing to allow Canadians to speak freely about Nexen? EOS BOS Why push a scorched earth policy on those who want to search for the truth, an important tool in our society? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this proposed transaction will be scrutinized very closely. EOS BOS The views of a variety of stakeholders will be considered, including those submitted by Canadians. EOS BOS We welcome foreign investment that is in the best interests of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have received tens of thousands of emails and letters about Nexen, including from Conservatives, who agree with the NDP position on this and say that the Conservatives should be listening to the public. EOS BOS The Winzoski affair takes this to a whole new level. EOS BOS The member for Selkirk— EOS BOS Interlake said that he was “strongly opposed to this deal” but EOS BOS also that “there is little that can be done to stop it”.Why are Conservatives not allowing public consultation and are so afraid of dissenting voices, and why must a journalist lose her job because of the mess the Conservatives have created on Nexen? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, to be clear, the NDP is opposed to every initiative to increase trade. EOS BOS In fact the NDP trade critic says they are opposed because “unions do not want it”. EOS BOS On this side of the House we listen to Canadians and will act in the best interests of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we really did not need another example of the Minister of National Revenue's poor management of her departmental portfolio, but unfortunately, she has given us one anyway. EOS BOS The Conservative blunder with regard to the changes to the child tax benefit for single-parent families has hit families twice as hard as expected. EOS BOS The Conservatives have taken over $50 million away from families that really need it. EOS BOS How could such an error have occurred without anyone in the department noticing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we certainly do regret when these kinds of unfortunate errors occur and the impact they have on Canadian families. EOS BOS I have expressed my strong concern to the Commissioner of the CRA and I have asked the taxpayers' ombudsman to conduct an investigation into this issue to ensure things like this do not happen. EOS BOS I can announce, however, that cheques will begin to flow to identified families by November 20. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this evening, in honour of International Women's Day, the Prime Minister will be in Toronto attending a private dinner with members of the board of directors of BlackRock. EOS BOS BlackRock currently has $5 trillion in assets under management around the world and is interested in the Liberals' plan to privatize our public infrastructure. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister stand up and explain to us why, of all the possible activities on this International Women's Day, he chose to spend the evening with members of the board of directors of an investment fund? EOS BOS Can he tell us what is on the agenda for this meeting? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, our primary motivation is to give air passengers better choices. EOS BOS That is what motivates us most. EOS BOS We are working very hard to lower costs, give travellers more choices, and reduce the time it takes for them to go through security or customs. EOS BOS We want to acknowledge that passengers have rights. EOS BOS Improving passenger service is what motivates us when we talk about our airports and our airlines. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order relating to the apology offered by the member for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound for two references to Hitler. EOS BOS While the House heard an apology and, through you, Mr. Speaker, accepted it, the member has since said, “just in order to take the buzz off and what have you, I partially retracted the statement in the house”, adding, EOS BOS “what I said was the truth” and adding also “the similarities between the gun registry and what Adolph Hitler did to perpetrate his crimes are very clear and obvious”. EOS BOS I realize that points of order are not used for points of debate and, as such, I will confine myself to the merits of the matter in the parliamentary context. EOS BOS First, Mr. Speaker, I believe that you must find the language unparliamentary, to say the least, in several respects, something which has not yet happened but must be done, lest such references be seen as acceptable conduct in this place. EOS BOS Language is what we are all about and offensive language must be sanctioned. EOS BOS I draw the attention of all members to a ruling given on December 11, 1991, and found at pages at 6141 and 6142 of the Debates, wherein Mr. Speaker Fraser, as paraphrased by your predecessor. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker Milliken, reminded members that “offensive remark linger and have a suffocating effect on the fair exchange of ideas and points of view. EOS BOS Anything said in this place receives wide and instant dissemination and leaves a lasting impression. EOS BOS Offending words may be withdrawn, denied, explained away, or apologize for, but the impression created is not always as easily erased”. EOS BOS Indeed, Mr. Speaker, while the matter might have been seen as laid to rest, as you yourself put it, the member's subsequent retraction of his apology and, indeed, with even more odious language, reignites the issue and, I submit, warrants sanction. EOS BOS Indeed, as O'Brien and Bosc clearly note on page 619, the withdrawal of unparliamentary language must be done, and this is the key point, “unequivocally”. EOS BOS It has not only not been withdrawn unequivocally, it has been reaffirmed in all its incendiary language and comparisons. EOS BOS Indeed, the unparliamentary nature of the language is evident in several respects. EOS BOS First and foremost is the actual language used, in particular, the odious and obscene comparisons to Hitler, the paradigm of radical evil. EOS BOS I draw to your attention the extensive list in the sixth edition of Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms of the House of Commons of Canada  wherein terms such as “Nazi” were found to be unparliamentary in this place as early as 1962, and the comparisons here, Mr. Speaker, go beyond that. EOS BOS I believe all members of the House would be in agreement that references to other persons, such as the former minister of justice or the senator in the other place, as being Hitler, or acting as Hitler might have, or thinking as he might have, are as unacceptable as they are offensive. EOS BOS Indeed, in 2007, in a point of order regarding comments by the member for Winnipeg Centre comparing a minister to Mussolini, the then chief government whip even said, somewhat prophetically one might say:Let us just imagine if this is allowed to stand. EOS BOS What will be next? EOS BOS There will be people in this place compared to Adolf Hitler. EOS BOS That is where this is headed. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member knows that. EOS BOS That is from Hansard. EOS BOS In ruling on that incident, Mr. Speaker Milliken recalled for the House that, as per Marleau and Montpetit, one of the most basic principles of parliamentary procedures and proceedings in the House be conducted in terms of a free and civil discourse. EOS BOS It is clear that such references to Hitler thereby trivializing and demeaning the Holocaust and attributing or ascribing what has become a metaphor for radical evil to those who comment on or conduct matters that have no relation or comparison to Hitler's crimes of mass atrocity are as odious as they are ignorant and have no place in the House. EOS BOS On this point, let there be no mistake about it: Hitler did not take away guns from Jews, Mr. Speaker, Hitler murdered Jews, who had no guns. EOS BOS Any suggestion otherwise is odious and obscene. EOS BOS (1520)Beyond the Hitler references, the member referenced two individuals, the former minister of justice and a former member of the other place. EOS BOS I would note that O'Brien and Bosc clearly states, on page 617:Members have a responsibility to protect the innocent, not only from outright slander, but from any slur directly or indirectly implied, and that Members avoid as much as possible mentioning by name people from outside of the House who are unable to reply in their own defence. EOS BOS Clearly, the member's implied slur is beyond the pale and neither of the two individuals so maligned have the opportunity to rise in this place and defend themselves. EOS BOS Moreover, what the member said about the former member of the other place was unparliamentary as per O'Brien and Bosc, at page 615, “ EOS BOS it is out of order the question of Senator's integrity, honesty or character”. EOS BOS While that senator is no longer serving, the member for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound referenced actions of that senator while she served and thus I believe the protection hereto must be extended. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, you said, during discussion of this point when first raised that “it is the practice of the House that once a member withdraws a comment or apologizes it is left at that” EOS BOS . I believe the practice of the House is also that a member cannot say he or she apologizes in here and then retracts the apology or undermines it and indeed in fact repeats the odious reference outside this place. EOS BOS In essence, the member did just that by offering an apology that was insincere, by his own admission offered only “to take the buzz off” and, per his own clarification, is only a partial retraction. EOS BOS The House will recall again that should the Speaker find language to be unparliamentary, as per page 619 of O'Brien and Bosc, the member “will be requested to rise in his or her place and to withdraw the unparliamentary word or phrase unequivocally”. EOS BOS Thus, Mr. Speaker, while you cannot change the member's mind, you can ask that he withdraw the remarks, something which he did not do. EOS BOS Furthermore, with respect to the retraction of his apology, I believe stronger sanction is warranted and urge you, Mr. Speaker, to, in line with the precedence outlined in the sixth edition of Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms of the House of Commons of Canada, name the member or inform him that he will not be seen by the Chair until he appears at the bar of the House to apologize for these obscene and odious remarks and comparisons. EOS BOS Simply put, the member has not sincerely and completely apologized for his remarks. EOS BOS Indeed, he has even reaffirmed them in a more hateful form and they remain as he did not withdraw them. EOS BOS This cannot be an acceptable practice or precedent that we can allow to stand in the House. EOS BOS Redress and sanction are warranted. EOS BOS I implore you, Mr. Speaker, to exercise your necessary authority in this regard so that the integrity of the House and its members be protected so that those who are maligned outside the House would also be protected and, indeed, that the memory and meaning of the Holocaust be protected and preserved. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Mount Royal for his intervention. EOS BOS I would simply ask that should you determine that you wish to respond to the point of order, that you give the member for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound an opportunity to respond to this point of order that was made today. EOS BOS I anticipate that should the member wish to make certain responses, it will be done in the next few days. EOS
BOS Given the request to allow the member for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound time to at least speak to this issue, I would point the House to O'Brien and Bosc, at page 614, which states:The Speaker has no authority to rule on statements made outside the House by one Member against another. EOS BOS We know that outside the chamber, when a member or anyone may say something that would offend or call into question someone's character, there are remedies that are not available inside the chamber. EOS BOS That is usually why the authority of the Speaker does not extend outside the chamber for things that are said. EOS BOS Therefore, given the intervention by the parliamentary secretary, we will hear the member for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound. EOS BOS Does the member for Mount Royal have a follow-up statement he would like to make? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in respect to what you just said, the remarks made outside the House were in reference to and expanded upon the remarks that he made in the House and were in reference to the alleged apology which the hon. EOS BOS member retracted and, as I said, added to those hateful remarks. EOS BOS They are inextricably bound up, one with the other. EOS BOS One cannot abstractly separate what happened outside the House from that which occurred inside the House and which gave expression to that which occurred outside the House. EOS BOS They are both bound up together. EOS BOS They form one set of odious remarks. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not just unemployed young people who are being shut out by this Conservative government. EOS BOS All four Atlantic provinces have stood as one and said no to Conservative EI cuts. EOS BOS They have said no to forcing workers to take a 30% wage cut. EOS BOS They have said no to Conservative contempt for seasonal industries. EOS BOS They have said no to policies that treat unemployed workers like criminals. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives listen to the premiers and stop their attacks on Atlantic Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member is totally misrepresenting the changes that are there and that are designed to help connect Canadians with jobs. EOS BOS That is what it is all about. EOS BOS In fact, the cornerstone of our economic action plan 2013 is training and job creation, through measures like the Canada job grant that will connect unemployed Canadians with the training they need to fill the jobs employers are having a really tough time finding qualified Canadians to fill. EOS BOS We will help those Canadians get the skills they need for those jobs. EOS BOS The NDP should try doing that for a change too. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives needed only 160 words to justify a procurement process worth over $25 billion for the F-35s, which, I would again point out, are still in development and behind schedule and which come with no guarantee of any economic benefits. EOS BOS A former senior official responsible for the F-35s has said: “ EOS BOS The government insulted Canadians’ intelligence by using disinformation and repeatedly manipulating the facts to achieve its goals.”So who is responsible for this manipulation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing is a very comprehensive response to concerns raised by the Auditor General. EOS BOS We have now in place much more transparency, accountability, and reporting to Parliament and to the public. EOS BOS We also have independent oversight. EOS BOS Let me also add that there is a freeze on any spending until all seven steps are met. EOS BOS Most importantly, I remind the House and the member opposite that there has been no money spent on acquisition. EOS BOS There were no contracts signed, but we are moving forward with this important replacement of the CF-18. EOS BOS I would encourage the member opposite to support this important investment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about the seven-step plan, but we have a seven-word solution: just put this contract out to tender. EOS BOS A retired assistant deputy minister in charge of DND procurement disclosed a document confirming that the Minister of Public Works and Government Services would have signed off on the 160-word letter from DND. EOS BOS For now, rhetoric aside, simply yes or no: did the Minister of Public Works and Government Services sign off on the letter from DND? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, we have followed the advice and the recommendation of the Auditor General. EOS BOS We responded with a very comprehensive plan. EOS BOS In fact, we have gone beyond that recommendation to ensure greater transparency and accountability. EOS BOS All of the departments now are working in unison through the secretariat. EOS BOS We will move forward with this important procurement, unlike the members of the no-defence party. EOS BOS Those members have a thinly veiled agenda, which is not to support military procurement. EOS BOS We will move forward on this project. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Psychiatric Association president, Dr. Fiona McGregor, said that no officials in the Department of Defence have contacted the organization regarding mental health worker recruitment. EOS BOS Dr. McGregor said that recruiting by press conference is an ineffective way to encourage psychiatrists and psychologists to come to work for the military. EOS BOS She says that a more comprehensive approach to the problem is needed. EOS BOS Can the minister tell the House what his government is actually doing to recruit mental health workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, I can. EOS BOS I thank the member for that question, because we have actually undertaken, over the last number of years, a very extensive effort to recruit psychiatrists and mental health professionals, including the use of a contracting firm in which we advertised online. EOS BOS We went out to find trade journals that would reach those individuals. EOS BOS We have recruited at conferences; as well, we have gone to the annual Canadian Psychiatric Association conference and worked collaboratively with the Canadian Medical Association and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. EOS BOS Most importantly, we continue to bring these professionals into the fold in the Canadian Forces so that we can meet the challenges of mental health and bring these issues into the light. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, cuts to mental health services in the Canadian Forces are of grave concern to its members, to their families and to all Canadians. EOS BOS Dr. McGregor said the Canadian Psychiatric Association and its members are keen to collaborate. EOS BOS Canadian soldiers returning from Afghanistan deserve support. EOS BOS This will not happen if the Conservative government continues its plan to cut services. EOS BOS Military families are waiting for a commitment, Canadian health care professionals are waiting to collaborate and the Canadian public is ready for the government to treat our forces with the respect they deserve. EOS BOS Will the minister reverse his plan to cut these critical mental health services? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what I will do is continue to work with my department to increase these critical mental health services, which is exactly what we are doing. EOS BOS We are working toward doubling the number of professionals in our hire right now. EOS BOS We have continued to make those important investments, both in joint personal support units across the country, in programs and in working closely with Veterans Affairs. EOS BOS We will continue to make those investments because these individuals need the help and have asked for the help. EOS BOS I am pleased to hear the member opposite mention that the Canadian Psychiatric Association is prepared to work with the Department of National Defence. EOS BOS We embrace that offer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the coast of B.C. is home to four globally unique glass sponge reefs, the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound glass sponge reefs. EOS BOS Once thought to be extinct worldwide, these 9,000-year-old glass sponges offer a vital water filtration service and are home to many aquatic species. EOS BOS Could the parliamentary secretary tell the House what the government is doing to protect this unique ocean feature? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking the member and his constituents for their recent work on the Fisheries Act. EOS BOS A few weeks ago, in B.C., the minister announced the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte glass sponge reefs marine protected area. EOS BOS These reefs are important habitat for many aquatic species, and I thank the indigenous, conservation, and industry partners involved in making this designation possible. EOS BOS Our government is further committed to increasing the proportion of marine and coastal areas that are protected to 5% this year and 10% by 2020. EOS BOS This is good news for Canada, and this is great news for future generations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, investigators have confirmed that the same IP address used by Pierre Poutine to order electro-fraud was also used by party staff to connect directly with the Conservative war room. EOS BOS Investigators have also confirmed that key evidence from the Conservative database has gone missing. EOS BOS The Conservatives need to stop acting like Watergate burglars and come clean with Canadians. EOS BOS As first steps, would the parliamentary secretary at least admit that the IP address linked to voter fraud was linked to the Conservative Party? EOS BOS It is a simple question. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the simple answer is the member is absolutely incorrect in stating that any IP address, as indicated, is in any way located or connected to the Conservative Party of Canada. EOS BOS It is absolutely incorrect. EOS BOS I can state that emphatically. EOS BOS What I can also say is that the member continues to do what the Chief Electoral Officer has suggested that he should not do. EOS BOS The Chief Electoral Officer said he found making sweeping allegations of wrongdoing without facts to support them to be troubling. EOS BOS That is all this member does. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we will reiterate the facts. EOS BOS The computers linked to illegal acts in voter fraud are also linked to the Conservative Party. EOS BOS The database information came from the Conservatives' database over on Lancaster Road, and we now know that key data records have been deleted. EOS BOS Therefore, rather than subject Canadians to this endless fan dance of prevarication, would the member stand up and tell Canadians that he actually takes it seriously that electoral fraud happened under the Conservatives' watch? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not going to engage in a game of Clue with the member opposite, but perhaps he would like to get one. EOS BOS What I can say quite clearly--Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS parliamentary secretary has the floor. EOS </s> BOS What I can say quite clearly, Mr. Speaker, and the member knows this full well, is that there is no evidence. EOS BOS In fact, the evidence is clear. EOS BOS The Conservative Party of Canada had absolutely nothing to do with this. EOS BOS Any computer IP address that the member is referring to has nothing to do with the Conservative Party of Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that when it comes to elections, the Conservatives are not very clean. EOS BOS We are aware of new revelations about the crooks who hide in the Conservatives’ ranks. EOS BOS Their former candidate in Verchères— EOS BOS Les Patriotes was the notary for the West End Gang, a criminal organization in Montreal. EOS BOS The man who posed proudly on Conservative signs signed off on loans with a 60% interest rate. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives take on the usurers who are ripping off thousands of Canadians, instead of associating with these criminals? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, they just keep going into the mud pit. EOS BOS The allegations made by the member, first, have nothing to do with the operations of government, and second, have absolutely nothing to do with the Conservative Party of Canada. EOS BOS The individual that the member has referred to has absolutely no connection with the Conservative Party. EOS BOS He has not been a member for many years, and the member knows that full well. EOS BOS He should stop flinging mud. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what Canadians know is that the Conservatives got rid of him only because he accused the Prime Minister of abandoning Quebec, not because he was crooked. EOS BOS The Conservatives chose a criminal who specialized in money laundering to represent them. EOS BOS They decided that a man who was hand in glove with organized crime was the dream candidate to be the Conservative standard-bearer in peaceable Montérégie. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives going to admit their mistake and do something to take on their criminal pal who is stealing from people? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, those are outrageous statements that say a lot more about the member who made them than they say about anyone on this side of the House. EOS BOS What I can say very clearly is that I can stand behind the ethical standards of this party, the people on these benches and the people who work hard on behalf of Canadians. EOS BOS Those allegations have nothing to do with the Conservative Party,  and that person has not been a member of the party for many years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the hon. member for Parry Sound—Muskoka managed a $50 million slush fund from his constituency office. EOS BOS We know that despite the presence of a number of senior officials, no documents were handed over to the Auditor General, and, surprise, now we find out that he did not act alone. EOS BOS Other ministers joined the party when they were invited to submit infrastructure projects. EOS BOS Does the government continue to believe that no new facts have surfaced and that the ministers involved in the G8 scandal did nothing wrong? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the former infrastructure minister made these decisions. EOS BOS Each dollar has been accounted for. EOS BOS Not a penny is missing, as Mr. Wiersama, the former Auditor General, has said. EOS BOS He said that he knows what they got for that money. EOS BOS Thirty-two projects were funded and the government announced each one. EOS BOS They can be found on the department's website. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are among friends. We can tell it like it is. Wasting $50 million of taxpayers' money, using government coffers for personal political spending— EOS BOS it all smacks of a great political, financial and ethical scandal. EOS BOS The Conservatives are saying that they want to implement the Auditor General's recommendations. EOS BOS If one of these recommendations were to have Parliament get to the bottom of this, would the government agree to submit to a full royal commission on the G8 scandal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there already has been an inquiry into it. EOS BOS There has been an exhaustive review by the interim Auditor General. EOS BOS If I could quote a truly great Canadian, “the facts have not changed”. EOS BOS Everyone could take a moment now to recognize that truly great Canadian, the hon. EOS BOS member for Calgary East. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 139 days and the Muskoka member is still hiding behind the backbenchers and not explaining why he hid the paper trail in his office. EOS BOS The Auditor General said that he broke the rules and called on Parliament to investigate. EOS BOS That was before we learned about all the other cabinet ministers who were taking his lead and going to the pork buffet as well. EOS BOS How many other ministers circumvented the rules, took this man's lead and used the taxpayers' Treasury Board as their own personal cash machine? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I clearly could not say this with the same level of eloquence as my colleague for Calgary East, but I will try to explain it for the hon. EOS BOS member, who has heard this answer so many times before. EOS BOS The minister responsible for infrastructure made this decision, all 32 projects were public, every dollar was accounted for and the projects came in under budget. EOS BOS That is the reality. EOS BOS The reality also is that the member across the way has promised his constituents time and time again to support the elimination of the long gun registry. EOS BOS Will he honour his word, do the right thing and vote for our bill to do just that? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the big game hunter on the backbenches is going to take down this scandal, he is going to have to put a little more ammunition in his pop gun. EOS BOS The facts are that since the Muskoka minister has to hide behind members like him to answer, I will do him a favour and I will speak for the Muskoka minister. EOS BOS He said “ EOS BOS If set up a parallel process where the Auditor General did not know, I would be resigning right now and turning myself in to the local police”. EOS BOS The question for my good friends on the Conservative backbenches is this. EOS BOS Will someone volunteer, do the right thing, help this verbally challenged minister, put up a hand and call 1-800-Huntsville PD. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member continues to ask the same question, so he will continue to get the same answer. EOS BOS The reality is that the former minister of infrastructure made this decision. EOS BOS He has taken responsibility for it. EOS BOS The reason we know what these projects are is because they are all published on the Infrastructure Canada website. EOS BOS There are 32 of them. EOS BOS We know where the funds went. EOS BOS We know that it came in under budget. EOS BOS We know every dollar went toward building the projects that have been published. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the bank that was announced this morning is a windfall for the world of finance. EOS BOS Our infrastructure, roads, water, and waste water systems will be privatized and cost taxpayers more. EOS BOS Even worse, Toronto banks will pocket the profits. EOS BOS Some believed that the bank would be located in Montreal, but this is Bay Street's government. EOS BOS Why is the government so intent on having the infrastructure in Montreal, Quebec City, and our regions line the pockets of Toronto's bankers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, regardless of the location of the bank, every community has the potential to benefit from the Canada infrastructure bank. EOS BOS We have put forward a $180-billion infrastructure plan to support communities of all sizes from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS Less than 10% of that will be delivered to the infrastructure bank. EOS BOS The rest of the money will flow through provinces, territories, and municipalities through other agreements. EOS BOS We believe that infrastructure is a strong foundation for growing our economy and creating jobs for the middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal-created partisan appointments know no bounds. EOS BOS Dwight Duncan, former Liberal finance minister and Liberal appointment as chair of the Windsor–Detroit Bridge Authority, is using his position to take partisan swipes at leaders on both sides of the border. EOS BOS One wonders when he has time to oversee the construction of the Gordie Howe bridge. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's personal directive to public office holders is clear. EOS BOS They must refrain from expressing partisan views. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals not appoint someone who can stickhandle this project without annoying everyone on both sides of the border? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the chair of the WDBA was appointed a year ago through an open, transparent, and merit-based selection process, and he brings a considerable amount of experience to this important position as a result of his diverse career accomplishments both in the private sector and in the public sector. EOS BOS His in-depth knowledge about the Windsor–Detroit region and his lifelong residency in the region is an asset. EOS BOS He has apologized for his comments, and I accept his apology. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if Dwight Duncan is in an apologizing mood, maybe he could apologize for working with Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne, turning Ontario into a have-not province while he was finance minister. EOS BOS With construction of the $4.8 billion bridge set to start next summer, Duncan has been preoccupied on social media gushing over Liberals and attacking anyone who is not. EOS BOS He admitted his inappropriate and reckless tweets and comments were an obvious lack of judgment. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister show some good judgment for once and fire this partisan political hack? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Gordie Howe international bridge is a very critical trade corridor between Canada and the United States, and 30% of the surface trade between Canada and the U.S. goes through this corridor. EOS BOS We are focused on getting this crossing built, and that is exactly why we appointed Mr. Duncan to undertake the duties of the board and also make sure that we are on time and on budget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under the false pretenses of openness and transparency, the Liberal government is busy being Liberal. EOS BOS It is secretive and partisan. EOS BOS Madeleine Meilleur's anticipated resignation, even before it was confirmed, sparked off long debates and seriously undermined the credibility of all future holders of senior positions. EOS BOS It is ridiculous. Because of the Liberals, the public's understanding is that, in order to be appointed, you must have contributed to the coffers or be a member of the select club of Liberal cronies. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister commit today to removing the Liberal Party of Canada membership card from the selection criteria? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have implemented a new, open, transparent, and merit-based appointment process. EOS BOS Our aim is to identify highly qualified candidates who will help achieve gender parity and truly reflect Canada's diversity. EOS BOS All Canadians can continue to apply for positions, which are advertised online. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to appointments it is clear that, if people are not Liberal, they need not apply. EOS BOS Whether it is trying to reward a retired Ontario Liberal cabinet minister or any long-time Liberal donors, the present  Prime Minister has shown he has only one priority, which is to take care of his friends at the cost of the taxpayer. EOS BOS The appointments process is now so botched that the Liberals cannot even find impartial candidates to be the next ethics or lobbying commissioner. EOS BOS The  Prime Minister has lost all credibility on this file. EOS BOS When will he get serious and let people who know what they are doing fix his appointments mess? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times in this place, we have put in place a new process, an open, transparent, merit-based process, where Canadians can apply for available positions, which are all posted online. EOS BOS I encourage all members to look into their communities to encourage Canadians who are wanting to serve this country in many different capacities. EOS BOS We know the important work these positions do for our country. EOS BOS We are looking for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS We are looking at gender parity. EOS BOS We are looking at bilingualism. EOS BOS This is an amazing opportunity, and all members can be part of this to get Canadians to apply. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the World Trade Organization admitted the ban on seal products adopted in the European Union was a political decision that has no basis in evidence or science. EOS BOS The opposition and the radical global activists who support such a ban are disingenuous. EOS BOS They are against the humane, sustainable seal hunt but they probably eat other meats, such as fish and chicken, and wear leather. EOS BOS Will the Minister of the Environment comment on the WTO's decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said before, opposing the seal hunt has had a devastating impact on northerners and coastal communities. EOS BOS The seal harvest in Canada is humane, sustainable and a well-regulated activity that provides a crucial source of income and food for Canadian sealers. EOS BOS This ban, which is not based on facts or scientific evidence, undermines the Inuit way of life. EOS BOS Our government will continue to stand with northerners and Canadian coastal communities to defend their traditional way of life. EOS BOS This is why our government will be appealing the WTO decision. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the B.C. Coroners Service announced last week that the province's death toll from suspected overdose now stood at 1,013, more than the entire number recorded during 2016. EOS BOS We know this is an urgent public health crisis. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Health tell us what she is doing to address this deadly epidemic? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague for his advocacy on this issue. EOS BOS Our government has been very clear that this is a national public health crisis in Canada, and we are responding in a way that is collaborative, compassionate, and comprehensive. EOS BOS In addition to passing Bill C-37, which streamlines the application process for supervised consumption sites, we are also providing over $10 million in urgent support to British Columbia to assist with its response to the opioid crisis. EOS BOS Our government will continue to bring forward evidence-based solutions to help save lives in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week we learned that 90% of cancer patients and their families suffer severe hardship, often bankruptcy, to pay for prescription drugs and home care. EOS BOS In the 2004 health accord, former Prime Minister Martin and the premiers agreed to fund and develop a national pharmaceutical strategy for medically necessary drugs. EOS BOS The current government abandoned that strategy, forcing patients to go on social assistance to get their medication. EOS BOS Is the government saying that Canadians should go bankrupt to stay alive? EOS BOS If not, what is its plan to help them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike a previous government that balanced its books on the backs of provinces and territories, we have committed to long term, stable funding that will see— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Health has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, unlike previous governments that balanced their books on the backs of provinces and territories, we have committed to long term, stable funding that will see health transfers reach historic levels by the end of the decade. EOS BOS Since we have formed government, health transfers from Ottawa to the provinces and territories have grown by nearly 35%. EOS BOS Our investments will help preserve Canada's health care system so it is there when Canadians need it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is telling us that the Navigable Waters Protection Act deals only with navigation. EOS BOS Using the same logic, he says that the Fisheries Act only deals with fish. EOS BOS Is he aware of the regulations governing mining discharges, under the Fisheries Act, that allow mining companies not only to kill fish but also to kill entire lakes? EOS BOS In other words, the Fisheries Act affects the entire environment. EOS BOS Will the minister soon be claiming that the regulations governing automobile emissions affect only automobiles and not the environment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member certainly knows how to complicate things. EOS BOS Public servants at Transport Canada consulted the provinces and territories in order to create the list of waterways. EOS BOS None of the provinces or territories expressed any problems or concerns. EOS BOS I understand that the opposition wants to create problems. EOS BOS No studies were needed in 98% of the projects. EOS BOS We have saved money for all Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS All departments apply the regulations that fall within their portfolios. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I hope that this government has the interests of Quebeckers at heart. EOS BOS A major energy development project is being proposed across the border from the town of Stanstead, in my riding. EOS BOS There has been no consultation of municipal, provincial or federal authorities. EOS BOS The people in my riding have reason to be worried about this project. EOS BOS Their health and safety are at risk because of the proximity of the project and its potential scope. EOS BOS What will the government do to ensure that the interests of the people of Stanstead are heard across the border and that they are consulted when this type of project is developed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member referred to a project a number of times but never called it by name. EOS BOS There are many projects in Quebec and we respect the jurisdiction of the provinces, the states and the people that we work with. EOS BOS Perhaps if we had a bit more information about the project, we could answer the question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a funeral can cost as much as $13,000, yet Veterans Affairs provides only $3,600 through the Last Post Fund to bury low-income soldiers if they meet the outdated eligibility requirements. EOS BOS In the last six years, over 66% of applications to the fund were rejected, which meant over 20,000 veterans did not even qualify. EOS BOS Department officials and stakeholder organizations have asked the government for changes for years. EOS BOS Our veterans deserve to be buried with dignity. EOS BOS Will the government do the right thing and increase the amount available for the funerals of our veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since 2006 more than 10,000 veterans and their families have benefited from the funeral and burial program. EOS BOS Unlike the Liberals who cut this very program, we have brought benefits and programs to veterans at an unprecedented level over the last seven years under the leadership of our Prime Minister. EOS BOS We are always interested in looking at ways we can improve our programs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to transporting oil, the Conservatives are still playing it by ear. EOS BOS The Canadian Coast Guard revealed that the new spill response plan for the St. Lawrence includes only the area from Quebec City to Anticosti Island, even though studies show that the environmental risk index for oil spills is very high all along the river, particularly between Valleyfield and Quebec City. EOS BOS How can the government justify excluding the Montreal-Quebec City corridor from what it calls world-class safety? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously we are pursuing the most ambitious trade agenda in Canadian history. EOS BOS At the same time, we have to make sure we are ready for that increase in traffic. EOS BOS After consultations with interested parties along the St. Lawrence with our budget 2015, our government expanded the pilot project area to include traffic along the river from Montreal to Anticosti Island. EOS BOS If that opposite member had actually read the budget and voted in favour of it, he would have been on the same side of the issue as we now are. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister should at least talk with the other minister about what is really going on. EOS BOS On the one hand, the Coast Guard announced that only that part of the river from Anticosti Island to Quebec City is covered by the emergency response plan, but on the other, Transport Canada is telling us that the corridor really does go all the way to Montreal. EOS BOS Who is right? EOS BOS It is not clear. EOS BOS When a spill happens, that is not the time to ask questions. EOS BOS The people and municipal elected officials need fast, effective intervention. EOS BOS What will the minister do to clear up this situation and protect people? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this seems to be a case where they cannot take yes for an answer, because clearly I have already just indicated that we have expanded the pilot project area to include the traffic on the river from Montreal to Anticosti Island. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board has lost track of $3 billion and now wants to stick his nose into the negotiations of crown corporations. EOS BOS He cannot even do his own job. EOS BOS He should mind his own business. EOS BOS The Conservatives' track record with VIA Rail is a disaster, and they continue to go after the CBC. EOS BOS Now we have to trust them to conduct negotiations with the employees of crown corporations. EOS BOS Really? EOS BOS Unionized employees are not the only ones who will have their hands tied. EOS BOS The Conservatives are now giving themselves the right to impose working conditions on non-unionized employees. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives meddling in these negotiations? EOS BOS Why do they not respect the independence of crown corporations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is completely false because crown corporations' finances are the government's business. EOS BOS We have to ensure that the costs are appropriate. EOS BOS Economic action plan 2013 indicates that the government will look at options to improve the financial viability of crown corporations, including compensation levels. EOS BOS [English]It is important that we respect the taxpayer and work with the taxpayer. EOS BOS That includes both our responsibilities within government and also the crown corporations that report to government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first you should find your $3 billion. EOS BOS From CBC to Canada Post— EOS </s> BOS I would remind my hon. colleague to address his comments through the Chair. EOS BOS I do not have $3 billion. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, from CBC to Canada Post to VIA Rail, the Conservatives are now giving themselves brand new powers over collective agreements at crown corporations. EOS BOS One moment the Conservatives say these corporations are independent, and the next they are riding roughshod over collective bargaining. EOS BOS These are just the latest Conservative attacks on labour rights. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives using their budget bill to handcuff collective bargaining at crown corporations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House stand for the taxpayer and stand for accountability of these crown corporations to the taxpayer EOS BOS .I cannot let it slide that the hon. EOS BOS member stood up just a moment ago and joked about anti-terrorism activity. EOS BOS Those members had a chance last week to vote on a bill that would improve our ability to attack terrorism to make sure we can protect the people of Canada. EOS BOS They voted no. EOS BOS That is their record. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, former Liberal defence ministers Bill Graham and David Pratt are calling on Canada to participate in the U.S. missile defence scheme. EOS BOS It was a bad idea in 2005 and it is a bad idea today. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister be very clear that he will not drag Canada into the U.S. system for ballistic missile defence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what I will be very clear on is that this government will always take the appropriate course of action to protect the security of Canadians. EOS BOS A decision, which was supported by our party some years ago, was made not to participate in that system, given the risks that existed at the time. EOS BOS Those risks have continued to evolve. EOS BOS The government will continue to examine the facts and will make any decision necessary to protect the security of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, is the Prime Minister serious? EOS BOS Does he really want Canada to participate in the American missile defence system? EOS BOS Is that his peace plan, an arms race? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know that the NDP takes an ideological position against defending Canada. EOS BOS However, protecting Canadians at all times has always been one of the responsibilities of Conservative and Liberal governments. EOS BOS A decision was made a decade ago. EOS BOS The government will continue to examine the situation before it determines a course of action. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals want to change the rules of the House under the guise of making Parliament more efficient. EOS BOS That party, which obtained only 39% of the vote in 2015, now wants to change the rules unilaterally. EOS BOS To hell with sunny ways. EOS BOS As a show of good faith, why do the Liberals not drop their plan, like they did for Motion No. EOS BOS 6, and create a committee whose membership is representative of the popular vote to look into the matter? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign, we promised to modernize Parliament and bring it into the 21st century. EOS BOS Our objective has always been to ensure that Parliament is relevant in the eyes of Canadians and that the House is accountable, predictable, efficient, and transparent.
              I know that we can work together. EOS BOS That is why it is a discussion. EOS BOS I encourage all hon. EOS BOS members to take part. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it was Stephen Harper who broke the record for shutting down debate in Parliament; yet in his darkest dreams, he never tried to stifle the voices of the opposition the way the Liberals are trying to do right now. EOS BOS It is the Liberal Prime Minister who wants to automatically limit debate on all government bills, and it is the Liberal Prime Minister who says he only has to show up one day a week to answer questions Canadians have for him. EOS BOS Newsflash: this House does not belong to the Liberal Party. EOS BOS It belongs to all Canadians, so will the Liberals step away from this disastrous and undemocratic plan, and work with us to make Parliament work again? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it was I who released the discussion paper. EOS BOS I shared it with all members in this place as well as the public. EOS BOS The member is correct that we are here to serve Canadians. EOS BOS Each of us is elected. EOS BOS The discussion paper provides many ideas, and it is a conversation, a discussion. EOS BOS We have asked the committee to do the important work that it does to modernize this place and to bring it into the 21st century. EOS BOS This government recognizes that members of Parliament do work in this place as well as in their ridings. EOS BOS As the member of Parliament for the riding of Waterloo, I am proud to have some of my constituents here EOS BOS . I will work for them in this place as well as in my riding as, I am sure, all members of Parliament do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how disingenuous can the member be? EOS BOS As we speak, the Liberals are trying to ram this through and force these rules on all of us. EOS BOS We all saw the Prime Minister try to elbow his way in this House last year, trying to get his way. EOS BOS That was not a pretty sight. EOS BOS Now once again he does not want to be here answering questions, so the Liberals are trying to force these changes on this House. EOS BOS Does the House leader or the Prime Minister commit that no changes will be made unless all of us agree, or are we to see elbowgate, act two? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, order. EOS BOS Most members in all parties are able to sit and hear things they do not like to hear. EOS BOS However, the test of course is for adults to be able to do that quietly, on all sides. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS government House leader. EOS
BOS Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to rise in this place and to remind all members, as well as Canadians, of the important work that members of Parliament do. EOS BOS Yes, there is a discussion paper. EOS BOS The discussion paper is available to all members as well as the public. EOS BOS The committee is doing the important work it does. EOS BOS The committee has the opportunity to look at ideas, bring in experts, and really consider a better way to do Parliament. EOS BOS We believe that all members on both sides of this place should have the opportunity to have meaningful discussion, and that is why I think it is an important conversation to have. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when I was elected in October 2015, my constituents expected that I would work very hard defending their priorities. EOS BOS Since then, I have worked countless hours to do a good job as an MP. EOS BOS How can a responsible government consider reducing the number of hours of work we do here in Ottawa? EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister not want to answer members' questions? EOS BOS It seems to me that the Prime Minister is not taking his job seriously. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us the truth and explain the real reasons for this new reform? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the previous government's approach was very different when it came to discussions and conversations. EOS BOS We believe that we can have discussions. EOS BOS We believe that these conversations are important conversations to have. EOS BOS I agree with the member that it is not about counting hours. EOS BOS Every single Canadian across this country, from coast to coast to coast, works very hard EOS BOS .
              We will continue to work hard for Canadians. EOS BOS We made a commitment to modernize this place and to bring it into the 21st century. EOS BOS That is what that discussion paper is about. EOS BOS I encourage the member not only to read the parts he chooses to, but to read the document in its entirety, because part of the suggestions I have offered are actually about looking at ways to improve this place. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals want to cancel Friday sittings, cut off debate in committees, eliminate debates on committee reports, and severely limit debates in this House. EOS BOS Now the Prime Minister only wants to show up for question period once a week. EOS BOS Maybe the Liberals can get one of those cardboard cutouts to fill in for him. EOS BOS The Liberals are diminishing Parliament and reducing accountability. EOS BOS They should not be changing the rules of the House to make this a safe space for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister end his constant attack on the ability of MPs to hold the government accountable? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it was this Prime Minister and this government that took unprecedented levels of consultations with Canadians EOS BOS . We will continue to work hard for Canadians. EOS BOS We will continue to work hard for members of Parliament. EOS BOS I know it is very difficult for the member opposite to understand, but our objective has always been to ensure that Parliament is relevant to Canadians and that the House becomes accountable, predictable, efficient, and transparent. EOS BOS I know we can work better in this place. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS I remind members that it is not helpful to decorum to suggest that members are unable to understand things. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as members of Parliament, we are just temporary occupants of these seats in the House of Commons. EOS BOS They do not belong to us. EOS BOS They belong to Canadians. EOS BOS They do not belong to political parties or the Prime Minister. EOS BOS The Liberals are proposing drastic changes to Parliament that will permanently damage the ability of MPs to hold the government to account. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals willing to cause collateral damage to the House of Commons in their attempt to damage the opposition, and when will backbench Liberal MPs stand up to the Prime Minister and defend the right of all members of Parliament to hold the government accountable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a discussion paper. EOS BOS It is true this place does belong to the people of Canada. EOS BOS That is exactly why I shared the discussion paper with all members of Parliament, as well as the public. EOS BOS This is a conversation that we want Canadians to participate in. EOS BOS We want Canadians to be part of this place and to help us make the important decisions that we make. EOS BOS I encourage all members to be part of the conversation. EOS BOS I encourage all members not only to listen to their views but to listen to opposing views and differing views. EOS BOS That is why I am encouraging us to have this conversation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2010, the Conservative government of the time closed several prison farms throughout the country, without doing proper consultation into the usefulness and viability of providing essential skills for inmates. EOS BOS In my riding of Kingston and the Islands two prison farms were closed in Collins Bay and Joyceville, without proper consultation of the public and to widespread concern from the public. EOS BOS My question is for the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. EOS BOS Can the minister provide some input into whether or not the government will continue along the same path, or reverse that decision of the previous government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the short answer is yes. EOS BOS We are launching a feasibility study on restoring prison farms in the Kingston area. EOS BOS This process will allow citizens, business leaders, and other stakeholders to share their visions for what the program could look like. EOS BOS It will allow the government to review the costs and efficacy of reinstatement. EOS BOS An effective criminal justice system is built on evidence-based policies that promote public safety and the reintegration of offenders. EOS BOS I thank the member for Kingston and the Islands for contributing to that goal. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Competition Bureau says that Canada's credit card companies have set up a perverse system that thwarts the normal rules of the marketplace. EOS BOS It has been estimated that Canadians pay $5 billion a year in hidden credit card fees, some of the highest in the world. EOS BOS This is infuriating to both consumers and small businesses. EOS BOS Why is it the Conservatives are A-okay with credit card companies filling their coffers with the money of hard-working Canadians? EOS BOS What is the government doing to address the lack of regulation on credit card fees? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we developed the credit card code of conduct with the support of consumer associations and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the New Democratic Party voted against it. EOS BOS That is what we have done. EOS BOS The opposition, of course, has done nothing. EOS BOS The case to which the hon. EOS BOS member refers is before the Competition Tribunal. EOS BOS It raises specific issues between various parties and the tribunal will deal with them in the normal course. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is rubbish. EOS BOS The Competition Bureau has released a scathing report. EOS BOS The commissioner says that the Conservatives spent over $60 million in five years on government credit card fees. EOS BOS People are already paying unreasonable interest rates on their own credit cards, and they have to cover the fees on government cards on top of that. EOS BOS The government, which is in a good position to negotiate fair terms with the big credit companies, is getting ripped off, so imagine what is happening to small businesses. EOS BOS How can the government justify wasting public funds like this when it is calling for austerity? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have worked hard for a long time to develop the credit card code of conduct. EOS BOS This involved consultations with consumer groups and small business groups. EOS BOS It has been very well received by the various business groups, particularly the small business groups. EOS BOS It is a way of regulating the market in a voluntary way. EOS BOS We have made it clear that there must be compliance. EOS BOS I am happy to say there has been general compliance. EOS BOS We have had a couple of instances where we have stepped in, but then we have had compliance to the credit card code of conduct. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I met with workers from Electro-Motive Diesel, families who were left to pick up the pieces of the government's failed jobs plan, fathers like Ryan whose five-month-old son now faces an uncertain future. EOS BOS The Prime Minister had no problem using these workers for an election photo op but in their time of need he is nowhere to be found. EOS BOS Will the government at least ensure EMD workers are not robbed of their pensions and severance, too, or will it continue to leave them out in the cold? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are aware of the decision by Electro-Motive Diesel to close the plant in London and we sympathize with the workers affected by this sad decision and their families. EOS BOS That being said, I just want to reiterate for the member that this issue falls entirely within the powers of the Ontario government and there was no ability for the federal government to intervene. EOS BOS We will continue working to create jobs and opportunities for workers in London and all across Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government can always find a scapegoat. EOS BOS What about a jobs plan?Our manufacturing sector is being shipped off piece by piece and the government is letting it happen. EOS BOS London is rallying behind its EMD workers but they all know that this could happen to anyone anywhere. EOS BOS We know that, under the government, big corporations and well-connected friends win out over families every time. EOS BOS When will the government finally wake up to reality? EOS BOS When will it stop subsidizing the companies that ship Canadian jobs overseas and start protecting communities like London, Ontario? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member should get her facts straight. EOS BOS I would remind the member that raising the capital cost allowance rate for locomotives was unanimously supported by the industry committee in February 2007, including by the NDP member for Windsor West. EOS BOS That cost allowance was eligible for people who bought locomotives, not for the ones who built the locomotives. EOS BOS The member should not mix up anything here. EOS BOS We empathize with what happened but it is a matter for the Ontario legislature. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I was concerned today to read that the president of Bell Media had delivered a speech warning Canadians about television unbundling. EOS BOS With television bundling, cable giants force their customers to pay for channels they do not want to watch in order to access channels they do want to watch. EOS BOS Bell Canada refuses to move powerful cellular antennae just 13 metres from a child's bedroom in Oakville, and now Bell is fighting consumer choice on cable TV.Will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister update the House on whether the government will continue implementing its throne speech commitments to defend consumers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that Canadian families work very hard every single day, and they play by the rules. EOS BOS We know that every dollar counts for Canadian families. EOS BOS At the same time, we understand that companies are going to watch out for their bottom line. EOS BOS It is our responsibility to look out for the bottom line of Canadian families. EOS BOS We believe that unbundling is a positive step to helping Canadian families. EOS BOS That is why last week the government directed the CRTC, under section 15 of the Broadcasting Act, to report back on options to fulfill this commitment by April 30, 2014.Canadians deserve an à la carte option for their cable TV packages. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to keeping our streets and communities safe. EOS BOS This is why I have introduced Bill C-394. EOS BOS My legislation targets those who attempt to recruit youth into gangs. EOS BOS Parents want gangs off our streets and out of their neighbourhoods. EOS BOS This legislation would help to achieve precisely that. EOS BOS With the final vote in the House of Commons scheduled for tonight, could the Minister of Justice please inform the House about the government's position on this important piece of legislation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the member for Brampton— EOS BOS Springdale for all his efforts to protect youth and for bringing forward this important legislation. EOS BOS I am proud as well to say that the government will continue to support this important legislation because it is consistent with our efforts to crack down on crime and make sure that our communities are safe. EOS BOS Unfortunately, this approach is ideologically opposed by Liberal members. EOS BOS Members will remember, of course, their efforts to fight our laws to better protect Canadians against drug traffickers. EOS BOS That said, I call on them for once to do the right thing tonight and support this important piece of legislation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, whether it is child poverty or whether it is skills training, whether it is a national energy and resource strategy for the country, whether it is the critical question of tax policy, whatever the economic issue may be, these are shared jurisdictions between the provinces and the federal government. EOS BOS I wonder if the Prime Minister could explain what objection he has to having a regular meeting with the premiers to discuss questions of economic management in the future of Canada. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I meet extremely regularly with the premiers, not just with the premiers but with business leaders, representatives of civil society and others to make sure that we are moving forward on precisely those fronts. EOS BOS That is why the Canadian economy, on so many of those things, has a superior record and, in particular, Canada has a much better fiscal position than virtually all of the western developed economies. EOS BOS There are 800,000 net new jobs. EOS BOS More Canadians are working today than before the recession. EOS BOS We are one of the very few developed countries that have achieved that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's reply to the question about unemployment before and after the recession is not quite correct. EOS BOS In any event, governments do not operate in silos. EOS BOS Provincial and federal governments share jurisdiction over resources or professional training in the economy. EOS BOS In every other federation around the world, first ministers hold conferences. EOS BOS Why not do the same in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I regularly meet with the provincial premiers, and I also meet with other representatives of Canadian society. EOS BOS That is important. EOS BOS Our philosophy on this side of the House is different. EOS BOS We respect the distribution of powers in Canada's Constitution, we respect the areas under provincial jurisdiction and we act within the limits of our responsibilities. EOS BOS That is one of the reasons for Canada's superior performance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is trouble with the philosophical approach, which the Prime Minister has just explained to the House. EOS BOS As knowledgeable as we now see that the Prime Minister is with respect to issues of philosophy, perhaps I can just bring him down to earth. EOS BOS When it comes to unemployment and jobs, when it comes to taxes, when it comes to health, when it comes to poverty, when it comes to the reality of Canadian life, people do not care whether it is a federal jurisdiction or a provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS They want their first ministers to be working in co-operation together. EOS BOS Why will the Prime Minister not do that, like all of the first ministers around the world? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, precisely what Canadians want from their leaders is not more meetings. EOS BOS They want action, and that is what they will get from this particular government. EOS BOS That is why we have better growth than most of the developed world, why we have a lower debt, why we have more job creation, why we have a stronger energy sector, why we have poverty coming down, why we have all of the benefits that attract people from around the world to this country. EOS BOS We have a country to be proud of, a system to be proud of, and as the federal and national government of this country, we take our responsibility seriously. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there you have it. EOS BOS The minister just gave Lowe's the go-ahead to buy Rona. EOS BOS He alone had the power to turn promises made by Lowe's into legal obligations, but he did not do so. EOS BOS He decided that the American giant's words, which are legally worthless, were good enough. EOS BOS That is the problem with Quebec being part of Canada. EOS BOS We are entirely dependent on a guy from Toronto to care enough to protect our economy, but he is just not stepping up, and Quebec's economy is suffering as a result. EOS BOS Why did he not turn the promises that Lowe's made into legal obligations? EOS BOS Is it because he cannot do his job or because he could not care less about Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my hon. colleague EOS BOS , I will give a simple answer to his question. EOS BOS Lowe's has made firm commitments in connection with its purchase of Rona. EOS BOS As I have said, the head office will remain in Boucherville. EOS BOS Canadians will continue to play an important role within Rona's senior management. EOS BOS Canadian suppliers will have opportunities to sell not only to Rona, but also to the entire Lowe's chain in the United States and around the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, almost a year and a half ago, I wrote to the Minister of Human Resources to alert her that foreign pilots were being used under the temporary foreign worker program to displace Canadian pilots in the off-season. EOS BOS This practice denies Canadian pilots jobs and prevents them from accumulating the flight hours they need to qualify them to fly larger planes. EOS BOS I never received an answer to my letter. EOS BOS Can the minister take this opportunity to assure Canadian pilots that this practice is now over and that their career opportunities will no longer be constrained by misuse of the temporary foreign worker program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are indeed concerned about the situation regarding temporary foreign workers. EOS BOS That is why we announced new reforms to the program. EOS BOS Beyond that, in terms of the airlines, we have been working with the airlines and with the pilots associations to make sure that they make every effort to recruit Canadians and to develop Canadians with the skills required for those jobs so that Canadians always get first interest on every job that is available. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in tabling his report, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development informed us that Quebec has nearly 2,300 contaminated federal sites, 160 of which are high-priority sites and constitute a public health risk. EOS BOS Eleven of these priority sites are in Montreal, including in the Old Port and Lachine Canal areas. EOS BOS The government has known about this situation for several years and has done nothing. EOS BOS When will it decontaminate these sites in Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her question. EOS BOS [English]What this report fails to tackle is that this program addresses only the most contaminated sites across Canada. EOS BOS In that regard, the commissioner notes that almost half, 42%, of the sites in the inventory were cleaned up by February of this year. EOS BOS This plan has worked well to date. EOS BOS It will continue to work well as we work our way to address the most serious contaminated sites. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in her victory speech last night, Montreal's new mayor, Valérie Plante, said she intends to ask the federal government for help increasing the supply of social housing units. EOS BOS In Montreal, 25,000 families are waiting for social housing. EOS BOS The mayor is adding her voice to that of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities' big city mayors' caucus, which recently called on the government to ensure that the national housing strategy includes funding to maintain and expand the social housing stock. EOS BOS Has the minister heard her call? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ms. Plante on being elected Montreal's new mayor.
              I also want to congratulate and thank all of the other candidates who worked very hard all across Quebec to run in the municipal election. EOS BOS I am personally very much looking forward to meeting Ms. Plante. EOS BOS In the coming weeks, we will launch Canada's first-ever national housing strategy, which will provide extraordinary opportunities to strengthen the Government of Canada's role in supporting our families in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the same Minister of Finance who is telling us that he has no money for anyone just increased the budget for the transition office to oversee the creation of a single securities regulator by 60%.While cuts are affecting food safety, rail safety and employment insurance, the Minister of Finance is ignoring the opposition expressed by provinces like Alberta and Quebec and shoving a plan down their throats that has received no new support. EOS BOS Why is the minister investing so much in this project, which is still very hypothetical, rather than in services for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada is the only developed country in the world without a single securities regulator. EOS BOS That is why we have been working together with the provinces to establish a single securities regulator for some time. EOS BOS We were pleased to see provinces such as British Columbia and Ontario advance the securities regulator. EOS BOS We are continuing to work with all the provinces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health continues to abdicate responsibility in the matter of the diluted chemotherapy drugs. EOS BOS The problem is that, as her Ontario counterpart said, this matter falls under federal jurisdiction. EOS BOS Marchese Hospital Solutions even approached her department as early as 2011. EOS BOS Why does the minister continue to deny that drug safety in Canada falls entirely under her jurisdiction? EOS BOS When will a permanent solution be found for this problem? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I stated yesterday, a provincial committee is examining the jurisdictional question surrounding the drug service provider. EOS BOS Marchese has never applied for regulatory approval. EOS BOS We have proposed interim solutions to provide assistance to the province to ensure that drug service providers fall within federal or provincial regulation, and we plan to work closely with the provinces and territories to address this matter. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in Granby, in my riding of Shefford, we have the largest francophone singing competition in North America. EOS BOS Since 1969, this festival has been an important vehicle for showcasing and promoting Canadian francophone talent around the world. EOS BOS Recently, the Minister of Canadian Heritage made historic announcements for Canadian creators. EOS BOS Could the minister tell the House what she is doing to support these artists and to showcase their work abroad? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his excellent question and for his work in the cultural sector. EOS BOS We believe in culture. EOS BOS That is why we invested $2.2 billion in our cultural sector since forming the government. EOS BOS When it comes to music, we also invested $4.15 million over two years to ensure that we can export our musical talent abroad. EOS BOS In addition, we invested $125 million over five years to relaunch cultural diplomacy and support our cultural exporting strategy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP has written a letter to Elections Canada asking for an investigation into the Liberal Party accepting donations that would violate elections law. EOS BOS Once again, there are ethical questions swirling around the governing party that promised to be the most ethical government Canada has ever seen. EOS BOS My question for the Liberal government is simply this. EOS BOS Under the law, what is the maximum donation they can legally accept? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has strict rules when it comes to fundraising and political fundraising. EOS BOS In fact, it is because of these rules that parties report all contributions they receive to Elections Canada. EOS BOS All parties in the House have received over-contributions this year, as was the case in previous years and, as such, all parties in the House have repaid their over-contributions. EOS BOS I look forward to bringing forward legislation to continuously improve, to make our fundraising more open and more transparent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the Liberals have not and they have broken the law. EOS BOS [Translation]
              It is a matter of ethics. EOS BOS Canadians rejected a Liberal government and its sponsorship scandal, and then they rejected a Conservative government and its Senate scandal. EOS BOS Do the Liberals really believe that, if they continue to deny the evidence of their turpitude, in the end, Canadians will believe them? EOS BOS That is highly unlikely. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as has been said in the House many, many times, the Prime Minister will answer any questions that the commissioner has. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has taken unprecedented levels of consultations and engagement with Canadians. EOS BOS This government is both approachable and reachable. EOS BOS That is why we will continue to respond to the very real challenges that Canadians are facing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, later today, members of Parliament, the Pakistani community, and the Bhatti family will gather here to honour the life and legacy of Shahbaz Bhatti, a Pakistani federal minister who was assassinated for his advocacy on behalf of Pakistan's minorities. EOS BOS Shahbaz was the inspiration for the Office of Religious Freedom, and the Bhatti family have been clear in their support for it. EOS BOS Will the government give them good news today and commit to keeping this office open after March 31? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, whatever structure will be put in place, it will be to strengthen the protection of religious minorities around the world, as the one my hon. EOS BOS colleague mentioned. EOS BOS We have only one goal here, to be sure that freedom of religion will be highly protected and a priority for Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the murdered and missing indigenous women's inquiry says that its slow progress is due to Liberal interference. EOS BOS In fact, it reports that eight out of 10 challenges are barriers put up by the Liberal government, like strangling bureaucracy and lack of resources. EOS BOS It is clear the Liberals misled families when they promised they were doing everything they could to help this inquiry succeed. EOS BOS Will the Liberals support the families of missing and murdered indigenous women, and when will they stop blocking the inquiry's work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the important work of the commission is crucial to getting the answers the families have been waiting decades for, and to ending this ongoing tragedy. EOS BOS We are absolutely committed to ensuring that the commission has all the support it needs to succeed. EOS BOS We have struck a working group to create and provide effective back-office support to the commission to ensure it is able to do its work effectively. EOS BOS Families must and will get the answers they need. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have the accurate research that clearly shows the Perimeter Institute received, and continues to receive, the funding that respects this government's promise. EOS BOS I would like to table this document to set the record straight. EOS BOS I would encourage the NDP to read the actual research and to stop making it up and misleading Canadians. EOS BOS With the permission of the House, I would table the public accounts document. EOS </s> BOS The minister does not need the permission of the House. EOS BOS He can table whatever he likes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to set the record straight on the family— EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS Setting the record straight is not a point of order. EOS BOS It is a point of debate EOS BOS . I would invite the hon. member to perhaps raise it in question period or in statements by members, but setting the record straight is not to use up House time as a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, are the documents tabled by the minister in both official languages? EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS It has come to the attention of the Chair that the document is in only one official language. EOS BOS Therefore, I would ask the Minister of State for Science and Technology to either provide a copy in both official languages or seek the consent of the House to table it in one official language. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I commit to tabling it in both official languages. EOS BOS I guarantee the facts are exactly the same. EOS BOS The research is consistent. EOS BOS The numbers are the same. EOS BOS The NDP is wrong, in both official languages. EOS </s> BOS We will wait for the document to be tabled in both official languages. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on that point of order, I do not know why the member referred to both being the same in both official languages. EOS BOS We do not have to laugh at our official languages of our country. EOS BOS We should respect that. EOS BOS There is something that happens with the government in disrespecting both official languages. EOS </s> BOS The minister has committed to tabling the document in both official languages and the House will wait for that before it is officially tabled. EOS BOS [Translation]I would like to thank the hon. EOS BOS member for Rivière-du-Nord for raising this point. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP people, power to the people.
							[Translation]This morning, the Minister of State for Democratic Reform was at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, but he did not explain his attacks on Marc Mayrand or his refusal to consult Canadians outside the Ottawa bubble. EOS BOS I would like to give him another opportunity to explain himself. EOS BOS Why does he refuse to travel to the various provinces across the country to consult all Canadians about his electoral reform plans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I always travel outside Ottawa to speak to all Canadians. EOS BOS I have spoken to Canadians about the fair elections act. EOS BOS For example, I spoke to organizations that represent persons with disabilities who have a hard time voting with the methods we use now. EOS BOS We will develop better information for these people, so that they can learn about the special services available to help them vote. EOS BOS That is just one example of the ideas I heard from Canadians that I included in the fair elections act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader left today's committee meeting on the unfair elections act to say he was against cross-country hearings, and said that meeting with Canadians would be a “gong show”. EOS BOS Does the Minister of State for Democratic Reform agree with the parliamentary secretary? EOS BOS Is that why they will not have cross-country public hearings, or are they just afraid to face Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously the committee will hear from Canadians. EOS BOS The member merely has to provide a list of witnesses and they can all be brought to the committee for testimony. EOS BOS They can share their views. EOS BOS We will take them into consideration. EOS BOS I know the learned members of the committee will consider those views as they improve the bill, which has been described by the former CEO as an A minus. EOS BOS Hopefully the committee can work with the government for a change to turn it into an A plus. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary said he was opposed to cross-country hearings on the unfair elections act because it would “influence public opinion”. EOS BOS Is that what the minister is afraid of, Canadians having the audacity to exercise their democratic right to express their personal views on this bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. EOS BOS The member and his party declared their opposition to the fair elections act before they had read a single word of it. EOS BOS Now they are trying to obstruct further examination of the question with an attempt at holding a costly circus that will distract from the work the committee needs to do, which is to study how we can keep everyday Canadians in charge of democracy by putting special interest groups to the sidelines and rule-breakers out of the game altogether. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister back to the House for the first time since November 2. EOS BOS We all know that the Prime Minister likes— EOS </s> BOS The hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Opposition is aware that members do not draw attention to the presence or absence of other members in the House. EOS
BOS Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister to the House. EOS BOS We all know that the Prime Minister would rather hang out with billionaires than answer questions in Parliament. EOS BOS When he is not mingling with them in Sun Valley or Davos, he is hitting them up for Liberal Party donations back home. EOS BOS In May, in fact, Chinese billionaires paid $1,500 for exclusive access to the Prime Minister at a Toronto mansion. EOS BOS Rubbing elbows with millionaires at these cash for access events does not pass the smell test, and the Prime Minister knows it. EOS BOS Why does he keep doing it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians faced a period of 10 years of lower than needed growth under the previous government. EOS BOS That is why we have committed to engaging positively with the world to draw in investment. EOS BOS I am pleased with the representations we have made in Davos and elsewhere to demonstrate that Canada is a good place to invest. EOS BOS When we talk about investments like Bell Helicopter in Mirabel with 1,000 more jobs, or the GM research in Markham, or the GE plant down in Niagara Region, we know that drawing in global investment is a great way to grow the economy and create jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not a coincidence that these billionaires the Prime Minister meets with actually want something from him. EOS BOS One of the guests at the mansion in May wanted government approval for a new bank in Canada— EOS BOS so, an individual pays $1,500 for exclusive access to the Prime Minister and that individual will get final approval for a bank a few months later. EOS BOS Not only does this event break the Prime Minister's own ethics rules, but it does not pass the smell test. EOS BOS He could stop this right away. EOS BOS Why does he not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians can be reassured that the federal level has some of the toughest rules and laws around political fundraising of any level of government in this country. EOS BOS Indeed, we have always followed those rules and the principles that underlie them. EOS BOS We also find it peculiar that the opposition members are trying to politicize that particular issue since it was their finance minister who approved that bank before they were booted out of office. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly a year since the inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women was announced, and families are now saying they are being left in the dark. EOS BOS Conservatives support the inquiry, but it is also our job to hold the government to account. EOS BOS There is no website, barely any staff has been hired, and no testimony will be heard until at least spring at the earliest, yet indigenous women are still suffering and there is no interim plan in place to help them. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister explain what action has been taken to help at-risk indigenous women? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is deeply committed to renewing the relationship with indigenous people, and we are delivering on our promise to implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call to action. EOS BOS In this year alone, we launched the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, have launched an overhaul of the child welfare system, made historic investments in first nations education of over $8 billion in budget 2016, and supported the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. EOS BOS This is just the beginning, and we are committed to making meaningful progress toward true reconciliation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has gotten to the point where every time the issue of tax havens comes up, so does the Liberal Party, and every time we talk about tax havens and the Liberal Party, the Minister of National Revenue sounds like a broken record. EOS BOS After learning that Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin, and Stephen Bronfman, three prominent Liberals, are hiding millions of dollars down south, we understand why this government refuses to take action against tax havens. EOS BOS It would rather defend the indefensible than clean house. EOS BOS Taxes are for other people to pay, certainly not the Prime Minister's friends. EOS BOS Will the Canada Revenue Agency do its job and investigate Stephen Bronfman? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, during the last campaign, the government was very clear. EOS BOS Cracking down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance was part of our platform. EOS BOS Over the past two years, we have invested nearly $1 billion, which has allowed us to conduct investigations and to recoup nearly $25 billion. EOS BOS Charges have been laid. EOS BOS We are working internationally and examining four jurisdictions per year. EOS BOS That is what Canadians asked us to do and we are getting the job done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot trust the Liberals to do anything but get caught with their hands in the cookie jar. EOS BOS We wondered why they voted against the Bloc Québécois motion to combat tax havens. EOS BOS We now know it was because that is where they hide their money. EOS BOS The Liberal Party is the tax-evasion party, and yet the Liberals still claim to be standing up for the middle class. EOS BOS Will this government finally take action and go after people who use tax havens to evade taxes, even if those people include friends, family members, or colleagues? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion, and we have taken concrete action to do so. EOS BOS Over the past two years, we have invested nearly $1 billion, allowing us to recoup $25 billion. EOS BOS Charges have been laid. EOS BOS We are working at the international level. EOS BOS We are working with our partners. EOS BOS The work is not done. EOS BOS It is ongoing. EOS BOS I can say that we have always done quite a bit more than the Bloc Québécois. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a recent report by the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami found that tooth decay is two to three times worse among Inuit than the average among Canadians. EOS BOS ITK wants to see more oral disease prevention, more health promotion and more treatment, rather than just more pulling of diseased teeth. EOS BOS Considering this, why did the Minister of Health end funding for the country's only national school of dental therapy, forcing it to close, when the people most in need are her own constituents? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is the single largest investor in research around the country. EOS BOS We invested in pathways to health equity, and one of the five priority areas identified under that $25 million program was related to oral health. EOS BOS The provinces and the territories deliver health care. We continue to increase transfers to the provinces and the territories because they know best where to prioritize the delivery. EOS BOS Meanwhile, the member for Western Arctic continues to vote against them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the consistently eloquent and very pertinent Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS We almost made it the whole way through. EOS BOS I will ask members to wait until the hon. EOS BOS member for Gatineau is finished asking the question before they applaud. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Gatineau. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that was the bouquet; wait until he gets the brickbat. EOS BOS He said that “the Prime Minister had no knowledge of what was taking place”.Is the Prime Minister routinely unaware or kept unaware by his staffers of what is going on in his own office? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for those kind words. EOS BOS It is always very nice to see such a collegial atmosphere in the House. EOS BOS I do like flowers and, of course, with lemons I like to make lemonade. EOS BOS My two daughters, this summer, actually had a lemonade stand where they sold lemonade for 5¢ on the street. EOS BOS They did very well. EOS BOS I am very proud of them. EOS BOS I thank the hon. EOS BOS member very much for those kind words and I look forward to the rest of the debate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when they sought asylum in Canada, all Adel Benhmuda and his family were looking for was a fair process. EOS BOS Instead, he was deported and tortured in Gadhafi's Libya. EOS BOS The Canadian Federal Court has ruled that they were subjected to an unfair process and their application was prejudged. EOS BOS The minister has been pushing for extraordinary powers to block people from entering Canada, but will he use the power he currently has to comply with the Federal Court and ensure that this family is given a fair hearing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no I will not personally intervene in this problem because that would be in violation of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act which ensures that decisions on applications for permanent residency on the grounds of humanitarian compassionate applications are made by delegated, independent, highly-trained professional decision-makers in the public service. EOS BOS I would like the New Democrats to stop asking ministers of the government to intervene in what is a non-political process where decisions are taken by independent public servants. EOS BOS What is it they do not understand about the rule of law? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today the government launched a call for proposals for research projects that will help us understand the mental afflictions regarding the homeless. EOS BOS Would the hon. EOS BOS Minister of Health share the details of this announcement with members of the House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform members of the House that our government developed, in close collaboration with the Mental Health Commission of Canada, an initiative for projects that will complement its work and is consistent with the mental health strategy for Canada. EOS BOS The initiative was launched today. EOS BOS It will help us understand how we can prevent homelessness in those afflicted with mental health issues. EOS BOS I am proud that our government created the Mental Health Commission of Canada in the first year of its mandate. EOS BOS It is too bad that opposition members voted against it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are appalled by the government's attitude towards human rights. EOS BOS This week, the Attorney General will argue that the Human Rights Tribunal does not have the power to enforce its own orders. EOS BOS Instead of questioning the authority of the tribunal, the government needs to say whether or not it intends to respect the human rights of first nations children in this country. EOS BOS That is the real question. EOS BOS When will the government respect the human rights of first nations children? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to completely overhauling child and family services for first nations. EOS BOS We believe that we are abiding by the tribunal's decision. EOS BOS We will now pursue our efforts with first nations and the provincial and territorial governments through the established tripartite process in order to work on real reform that focuses primarily on the well-being of children. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this has been a difficult growing season for farmers in Ontario and Quebec. EOS BOS Lower crop yields due to reduced rainfall in certain areas have left farmers without enough feed for their livestock. EOS BOS Earlier this summer, Hay East, a grassroots initiative to help transport hay from the west to Ontario and Quebec, was created. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food tell the House what our government is doing to help farmers in Ontario and Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that our government is supporting Hay East. EOS BOS Governments are providing up to $3 million to help transport hay to those farmers in need. EOS BOS This builds upon our government's robust suite of business risk management programs and our targeted tax deferral for livestock producers in Ontario and Quebec. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Statistics Canada recently released some new data showing that many Canadian families are seeing their net worth increase under our government. EOS BOS I would like to ask the Minister of Employment and Social Development to update this House on what the low-tax policies of our government are doing to improve the lives of Canadian families. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, while both the NDP and Liberal Party have announced they support Kathleen Wynne's plan to bring in a $1,000 payroll tax on the average worker in Canada, we have done exactly the opposite. EOS BOS Our low-tax plan is not only creating jobs, it is raising the net worth of the average Canadian family. EOS BOS In fact, the bottom 20% of income earners have seen their net worth increase by 38% since 1999.The overwhelming majority of our tax-relief measures have gone directly into the pockets of modest- and middle-income families. EOS BOS We are lifting people up by rewarding their hard work with low taxes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are obsessed with their many austerity measures, but they are refusing to tell us where and how the most draconian cuts will be made. EOS BOS We have learned that cuts to embassy staffing will force people to wait nine months instead of three for the visas they need to adopt children from the Philippines. EOS BOS Quebec families that were at the final stage of the process have just been informed that they will have to wait many more months for the children they are so eager to adopt. EOS BOS How can the government justify causing such a terrible situation and forcing families and orphans to pay the price for its ideological cuts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, frankly, I do not know what the member is talking about because there has been a huge increase in immigration and the number of visas at our Manila office in the Philippines. EOS BOS Over the past three years, Canada has received more immigrants from the Philippines than from anywhere else, and we have increased our service levels accordingly.I believe that the hon. member is absolutely wrong. EOS
BOS [Member spoke in aboriginal language]
              [English]
              Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. EOS BOS The government is committed to making real progress on issues most important to indigenous peoples, including education. EOS BOS Targeted investments in first nations education have been made to ensure a brighter future for first nations children. EOS BOS Nunavut currently has the lowest graduation rate in the country, with only 35% of students graduating. EOS BOS This is 50% lower than the national average. EOS BOS How and when will similar targeted investments be made for Inuit education in Nunavut? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in line with our commitment to work with provinces and territories, we recognize that the issues raised by my colleague are very important EOS BOS . I can assure him that they are at the very heart of our preoccupations. EOS BOS Recently the finance minister met with the organization Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents more than 50,000 Inuit in some communities my colleague has referred to. EOS BOS Our government transferred $1.6 billion for 2017-18 to Nunavut. EOS BOS We will continue to work with our partners to make sure we achieve results for all Canadians and to work with the member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, seniors have paid their dues to our country, but the government demonstrates over and over again that seniors just are not a priority. EOS BOS Fortunately, the NDP is listening to seniors. EOS BOS We held a round table discussion this morning to hear first-hand about the challenges seniors face. EOS BOS That is in contrast to the government's attitude of ignoring seniors' needs for affordable housing, pension security and pharmacare. EOS BOS Why does the government refuse to allow our seniors to age with dignity? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave us a strong mandate to continue doing more for seniors than any other government. EOS BOS It was our government that introduced pension income splitting, lower taxes for seniors, increased funding for elder abuse awareness and provided the largest GIS increase in a quarter century. EOS BOS What did the opposition members do? EOS BOS They voted against all of these measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry has been handing us the same line for months now. EOS BOS Maybe he should go tell the workers at Thetford Mines, where LAB Chrysotile is in bankruptcy proceedings, and the people of Asbestos who have been out of a job for months that asbestos is an industry of the future. EOS BOS The minister's line shows that he is out of touch with reality and that he does not care about the problems his constituents are facing. EOS BOS The minister has an opportunity: there will be a budget soon. EOS BOS He should commit to including a transition plan so that industries of the future can take root in his riding. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for over 30 years, the Government of Canada has encouraged and promoted the safe use of chrysotile. EOS BOS Recent scientific studies have shown that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment. EOS BOS That is the situation; nothing has changed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this country's position on asbestos is morally and ethically reprehensible. EOS BOS This spring--Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Winnipeg Centre. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government's position on asbestos is morally and ethically reprehensible. EOS BOS This spring, the parties to the Rotterdam Convention will meet once again, and my question is simple. EOS BOS If the government does not have the courage to ban asbestos in all of its forms like other developed nations have, will it at least stop sabotaging the Rotterdam Convention?All that convention does is to require that asbestos be listed as a product requiring informed prior consent, so that the people we sell it to at least have a fighting chance to protect themselves from this made-in-Canada epidemic. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will tell you what is shameful: when an individual launches a vicious personal attack against an individual who has twice been victimized, who has lost two of his children to crime and accidents. EOS BOS When this individual gets up and launches a vicious personal attack, I want him to do the right thing, to get on his feet and apologize to Senator Boisvenu. EOS BOS Do it now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the recent session at the UN commission on the status of women was attended by the Minister of Status of Women and several members of the standing committee. EOS BOS Two of my constituents from Truro, Linda MacDonald and Jeanne Sarson, made presentations there on the need for appropriate laws. EOS BOS These two women are tireless advocates for human rights and women's rights in particular. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Status of Women outline what progress was made at these UN meetings? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it was truly an honour to lead the Canadian delegation of over 200 Canadians at this year's UN commission on the status of women. EOS BOS People like Linda and Jeanne are truly at the heart of the movement to advance women's and girls' rights domestically and around the world. EOS BOS Canada has made significant progress since I was last there in 2013, and we will remain at the forefront of global efforts to ensure that women and girls everywhere can reach their full potential. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, when we asked the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages if she would appear before the committee to talk about the crisis currently rocking CBC/Radio-Canada, she said she was open to the idea. EOS BOS This morning, the Conservative members of the parliamentary committee voted against the NDP motion calling for a special appearance by the minister. EOS BOS While CBC/Radio-Canada might be an independent crown corporation, the minister has responsibility for it and she must be transparent. EOS BOS Why did her colleagues vote against the motion? EOS BOS Why is the minister refusing to take one hour of her time to explain how these cuts will affect millions of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member actually answered his question in his question when he stated that the CBC is in fact an independent organization that operates at arm's length from the government. EOS BOS When it comes to the direction it wants to take, whether it be programming, whether it be fiscal decisions, whether it be human resources, that is a decision to be made by the CBC. EOS BOS I think it is appropriate, and this government believes it is appropriate, for those responsibilities to remain with the CBC. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning, Conservatives voted down an NDP motion inviting the heritage minister to appear at committee to respond to CBC cuts. EOS BOS Despite the minister telling this House she wanted to appear, her colleagues obstructed our motion. EOS BOS The CBC is in crisis. EOS BOS It has lost great talents like Linden MacIntyre, yet we cannot even discuss it in Parliament. EOS BOS Will the minister tell her Conservative colleagues that she wants to appear at committee to explain these drastic cuts to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this member knows as well that CBC operates independently and at arm's length from the government. EOS BOS What folks would probably like to understand is that currently we are undertaking a study of Canadian music and the way that music is funded and the growth of all the artists who are Canadian who create all of this music across this country that is so well known around the world. EOS BOS In fact, if Greg Keelor, from the band Blue Rodeo, were in the audience today, I have a feeling that he would prefer that we focus on the success of the music, its industry, and our artists in this country instead of on questions that have nothing to do with what we are studying at committee. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in media reports today, the RCMP have alleged that an employee in Public Services and Procurement Canada was responsible for the leaks about Canada's shipbuilding program. EOS BOS However, the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence have both stated that they support the action directed by the PMO against a senior member of the Royal Canadian Navy. EOS BOS Now there are new allegations about another government department and another individual. EOS BOS Does it not just prove that the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence are simply incompetent on this file? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to open, fair, and transparent procurement processes. EOS BOS Through the national shipbuilding strategy, we are committed to getting the women and men of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard the equipment they need to do their jobs in protecting and serving Canadians. EOS BOS The strategy is a long-term commitment to shipbuilding that will rejuvenate our industry, support Canadian innovation, and bring jobs and prosperity to communities across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Democratic Institutions wants to change the rules of democracy without holding a referendum because that democratic instrument apparently is an outdated, 19th century tool. EOS BOS The minister thinks that she has the authority to change the rules without a referendum because she campaigned on this issue. EOS BOS By that logic, Quebec would have the right to independence without a referendum, making the Clarity Act null and void. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs throw out his Clarity Act? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that the member is going to be participating in the all-party process. EOS BOS He is going to have an opportunity to travel with the committee and pose questions. EOS BOS We have gone further than our normal committee process in ensuring that parties that are not recognized as parties in the House are included, because we feel that the voice of the Bloc and the voice of the Green Party are incredibly important to have at the table. EOS BOS That is why we have taken that measure. EOS BOS I look forward to that dialogue. EOS BOS I look forward to working on that with the member to modernize our electoral system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this reform is off to a bad start. EOS BOS The government wants to use its majority to change democracy. EOS BOS However, this should not be a partisan issue. EOS BOS Changing the way we vote cannot be left just to experts and parliamentarians. EOS BOS The people should decide. EOS BOS How can the government think it has a legitimate right to impose a voting system without a referendum, when it received less than 40% of the vote in the last election? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with the member that this process should not be partisan and that we need to work across the aisle to find compromise and work together, but the fact of the matter is that more than 60% of the Canadian population said the status quo was not going to work EOS BOS . I would ask members to start coming up with ideas. EOS BOS It is not enough to just say that they want the system to stay as it is. EOS BOS Canadians have not accepted that. EOS BOS They say they want our institutions to modernize. EOS BOS Be part of that process, give us ideas, make sure we are able to change the system so that Canadians are enfranchised and their voices are heard. EOS
BOS Pursuant to an order made on Wednesday, October 18, 2017, I will now make a statement commemorating the 150th anniversary of the first meeting of the first Parliament of Canada, after which I invite representatives of all parties in the House to proceed with their own statements. EOS BOS [Translation]
              I invite all members to the Hall of Honour for the unveiling of a decorative window commemorating this event.
              [English]
              Today we mark an important milestone in Canada's history, the 150th anniversary of the first meeting of the first Parliament. EOS BOS I am honoured that in recognition of this significant chapter in our nation's history, we have in attendance today several of our former prime ministers, speakers, and clerks of the House of Commons. EOS BOS On November 6, 1867, Canada's members of Parliament came together for the first time to begin shaping their new country, writing the laws that would enable their fellow citizens to govern themselves and strengthen our fledging democracy. EOS BOS [Translation]
              On this day 150 years ago, our predecessors embarked on an ambitious journey that continues to this day, the journey towards a fair, prosperous country for all citizens. EOS BOS (1510)
              [English] EOS BOS It is difficult to imagine the enormity of the task before those first parliamentarians gathered in the chamber that used to stand here, facing the monumental challenge of governing a vast and sprawling country still in its infancy. EOS BOS Consider, too, that in those days, Ottawa was not perhaps the most sophisticated location for Canada's capital. EOS BOS A decade before Confederation, the English essayist and political scientist, Goldwin Smith, dismissed Ottawa as “a sub-Arctic lumber-village converted by royal mandate into a political cockpit”. EOS BOS [Translation]
              To avoid hurting the feelings of Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, I should add that Ottawa has come a long way since those days. EOS BOS It has even become a leading city, and a lot of work has gone into its development, but there is, of course, always more to be done. EOS BOS [English]
              Any democracy worthy of its name is always a work in progress, and it is our duty as parliamentarians to build on the foundation laid by those first members of Parliament who established the country that it is our privilege to serve. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Prime Ministers, I rise today to mark a historic anniversary. EOS BOS On this day 150 years ago, Canada's first legislature sat for the very first time. EOS BOS Over the many years and sessions that followed, this House, more than any other institution, wrote Canada's history. EOS BOS Men and women sat in this chamber to debate and pass legislation to build a better, fairer, more equitable country for all. EOS BOS [English]
              Our 14th prime minister, the great Lester B. Pearson, once said, “We who are elected to serve Canada in Parliament owe those who elect us more than the advocacy of non-controversial ideas.” EOS BOS He was right. EOS BOS This House has hosted some of the most important debates and decisions of our time. EOS BOS Within these walls, Canada has been reborn countless times since Confederation, and in our progress we have defined the character of a country. EOS BOS It was here that Agnes Macphail broke barriers as the first female MP. EOS BOS It was here that we introduced universal health care. EOS BOS It was here that we abolished the death penalty. EOS BOS It was here that same-sex couples were extended the right to marry. EOS BOS [Translation]
              It was here that the Official Languages Act was debated and passed. EOS BOS It was also here that we righted some of our most terrible wrongs. EOS BOS We apologized for dark, shameful chapters in our history, especially the horrible way indigenous people were treated in the residential school system and the refusal to take in the innocent people aboard the Komagata Maru who were seeking help. EOS BOS This House has welcomed some extraordinary guests, including Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, and Malala Yousafzai. EOS BOS In fact, serving in this chamber is one of the greatest honours to which a person can aspire. EOS BOS [English]
              Day after day, year after year, members sit in this House and do important work on behalf of Canadians, work that impacts families and communities, work that shapes the course of people's daily lives. EOS BOS Because of the magnitude of what happens and what can happen here, we will not always agree. EOS BOS However, it is the way we disagree that defines us. EOS BOS Let us be women and men of principle and of humility, for we have been bestowed the responsibility to serve and we must do so honourably. EOS BOS We are lucky to have had strong leaders in this place to remind us of that, folks like Arnold Chan. EOS BOS Let us never lose sight of the fact that we are all here for the same reason, to make our country better, to improve the lives of the people we serve. EOS BOS We may have different ideas on how to get there, but there is always common ground. EOS BOS If we work together, we will find it. EOS BOS On this historic day, I call upon all of us to continue to work hard and to stay true to ourselves. EOS BOS On that, I am reminded of something that our 15th prime minister once said: “Our hopes are high. EOS BOS Our faith in the people is great. EOS BOS Our courage is strong. EOS BOS And our dreams for this beautiful country will never die.” EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for 150 years, our Parliament has been a reflection of Canada and Canadians. EOS BOS It is more than a building. EOS BOS It is the embodiment of our national character, its virtues and vices, its strengths and its weaknesses. EOS BOS [English]
              It has been burned to the ground and been built back up stone by stone. EOS BOS It has heard the echoes of gunfire, and felt the blast of a bomb that, thankfully, detonated mere minutes prematurely. EOS BOS It has rung with cheers of victory at the end of two world wars, and it has stood mute witness to the tears of a nation mourning distinguished former members of this House lying in state, from Sir John A. Macdonald to the hon. Jack Layton. EOS BOS [Translation]
              The legislative measures debated and passed in this chamber help Canada progress and, unfortunately, they also sometimes set us back. EOS BOS Our House has seen legislative measures that support our liberties, and others that limit them. EOS BOS [English]
              This is a physical place, but also an institution, and as an institution made of human beings, the outcomes are not always perfect. EOS BOS [Translation]
              As Canadians, we must not forget our past. EOS BOS We must never be afraid to admit when we have made a mistake and to apologize when necessary. EOS BOS [English]
              That is why Prime Minister Harper came to the House nine years ago and issued a formal apology to former victims of the Indian residential schools on behalf of a country that had failed them. EOS BOS It was appropriate, because so many of the decisions that caused so much grief and suffering had been deliberated and, in some cases, approved right here in this building. EOS BOS That we who have been trusted with the governance of Canada have sometimes failed should not be surprising. EOS BOS This chamber may be made of wood and stone, but the men and women who give it its life are hewn from the crooked timber of humanity. EOS BOS These chairs have supported patriots and heroes, but also a few rogues, so we cannot claim to have always been perfect, but we know that perfection is not available to us this side of eternity. EOS BOS Yet, somehow, the motley and imperfect assemblages that have gathered here over the last 150 years have achieved something of a miracle. EOS BOS Together, the members who came before us superintended a Canada that has grown and flourished beyond what anyone in the first Parliament could have dreamed. EOS BOS It is fashionable today to look down at the past, but that is a luxury we enjoy from heights built by those who preceded us in this chamber. EOS BOS If we look back at our rich history and study the leading figures in its telling and see only the blemishes, then we are missing out on the beautiful story of a country constantly bettering itself, and consistently offering a refuge to so many around the world. EOS BOS It is a story of different parliaments at different times, working through the imperfections of the day. EOS BOS It is a story that on the whole has been a story of hope for so many. EOS BOS It is a story of prosperity, compassion, liberty, and human rights. EOS BOS To those who deny we have anything to be proud of as a country, I would pose a simple question: “Where else would you have rather lived for the last 150 years?” EOS BOS That is not a rhetorical question. EOS BOS It is a straightforward question for which there is only one honest answer. EOS BOS There is nowhere we would rather have lived, no country we would rather call our home, for no country has acquitted herself better at home and abroad than Canada. EOS BOS It is indisputable that the world has been better off for the last 150 years because of Canada. EOS BOS Without the sacrifices of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen, more than 100,000 of whom paid the ultimate sacrifice, while many more came home bearing scars, mental and physical, the world would be more dangerous. EOS BOS [Translation]
               Without the brilliance of our artists, painters, sculptors, writers, singers, and actors, the world would be losing part of its cultural richness. EOS BOS Without the work of the men and women who cultivate, farm, and develop our incredible landscape, who fish in our three great oceans that surround us, and who work in the towns, plants, and office towers, the world would be poorer, colder, and darker. EOS BOS If we dwell on past mistakes, we miss out on their remarkable successes. EOS BOS We end up taking for granted their contribution to Canada and Canada's contribution to the rest of the world. EOS BOS [English]
              It is time for a little gratitude. EOS BOS Make that a lot of gratitude. EOS BOS That we have prospered and flourished is no accident. EOS BOS It is a combination of good fortune and good stewardship. EOS BOS We are fortunate to have inherited the most stable and enduring political system in the world. EOS BOS We should be grateful to the members of the House who have nurtured and sustained it for the benefit of Canadians and the inspiration of the world. EOS BOS For it is to this House that world leaders have come over the last century to express their admiration of Canada as the very exemplar of peace, order, and good government. EOS BOS It was here that Churchill came in Britain's darkest hour, when Hitler's armies were within sight of English shores, to thank Canada for our support and to display his jowl-shaking defiance in the face of Nazi aggression. EOS BOS Later, we were engaged in a very different kind of war against Soviet imperialism, a battle not just based on geography but on ideology, a battle to defend the economic freedom that had created untold prosperity for so many millions around the world, yet a freedom that was denied to so many. EOS BOS During that battle, two of the great figures of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, each came to this House twice to thank Canada for our friendship and dedication to key principles. EOS BOS More recently, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko came to Canada while his country was suffering under a new Russian imperialism, to praise "the special partnership between Ukraine and Canada" and to salute Canada as a model for Ukraine and for the world. EOS BOS It is in our nature as Canadians to be self-deprecating, but sometimes, maybe once every 150 years, it is okay to acknowledge what the rest of the world tells us: we occupy a special place in the fellowship of free nations and our institutions, including this Parliament, are the envy of other nations. EOS BOS I am not asking members of the House to pat ourselves on the back and congratulate ourselves for assuming this awesome duty. EOS BOS Rather, let us roll up our sleeves and get to work in the House and across Canada to continue the work of those who came before us so that those who come after us, 150 years from now, will consider us worthy of the same gratitude we offer today to our predecessors. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the House today to join my colleagues in marking the 150th anniversary of the first sitting of Parliament. EOS BOS Canadians can be truly proud of having built, shaped, and preserved one of the longest uninterrupted parliaments in the world. EOS BOS Every day we demonstrate to the world how ideas can be debated in a peaceful, civil, and productive manner, with the possible exception of question period. EOS BOS We show how we can come together to make life better for the people who sent us here to represent them. EOS BOS In a country as geographically, linguistically, and ethnically diverse as ours, this is no small achievement. EOS BOS [Translation]
              The NDP can be proud of the major firsts they have contributed to Parliament. EOS BOS Among those, our party was the first to have an openly gay man elected to the House and the first to have a woman lead a federal political party in the House, just to name a few milestones. EOS BOS There is no doubt that we have made a lot of progress since the days when Parliament was made up of only white men. EOS BOS We are pleased to see that the members sitting in the House look a lot more like the people who voted for them than they used to a long time ago. EOS BOS (1525)
              [English] EOS BOS However, we have to be honest that we are nowhere close to where we need to be. EOS BOS We have yet to achieve even near gender balance in the House. EOS BOS The 2015 election sent a record number of women to this chamber and yet they still only make up a little more than one quarter of the MPs in the House. EOS BOS All parties should use this important anniversary to commit to reaching gender parity in the House as soon as possible. EOS BOS New Democrats and Canadians across the country also believe our Parliament can be made even better by reflecting Canadians' actual voting preferences. EOS BOS [Translation]
              Let us be honest, the House does not reflect the proportion of support each party received in the last election. EOS BOS [English]
              If we move toward a proportional system of elections, we could not only make room for new voices, but re-inspire Canadians with the knowledge that their votes truly do matter and their Parliament is truly a reflection of their will. EOS BOS Surely there is no better way to mark the 150th anniversary of Parliament than by working to make it more representative. EOS BOS All Canadians will benefit from it. EOS BOS [Translation]
              No celebration of our Parliament would be complete if we did not mention the hard work of the devoted staff and public servants who, by the thousands, over many decades, have kept this institution on a steady course by handling everything that goes on behind the scenes. EOS BOS [English]
              We thank the Clerk, the committee staff, the legislative support staff, our financial officers, our cafeteria workers, the janitorial staff, the security guards, and every other member of the personnel who I will not be able to mention specifically today. EOS BOS This Parliament literally cannot function without them. EOS BOS Last, on behalf of the New Democratic Party, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all Canadians on the 150th anniversary of their Parliament and recommit to making this place a source of pride for our country, but, more important, a source of the support, solutions, and leadership that will make life better for everyone, from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS [Translation]
              Thank you and congratulations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to congratulate those who spoke before me for their heartfelt tribute to the 150 years of the Canadian parliamentary system. EOS BOS I am sure that the Canadian parliamentary system is something very important to them. EOS BOS I am sure that it is very important and that many Canadians are proud of it. EOS BOS Unfortunately, for many Quebeckers, it means something else. EOS BOS Let us face it, the 150th anniversary was not exactly celebrated in Quebec, which is not surprising. EOS BOS Quebec never looked forward to signing the British North America Act. EOS BOS There have not been too many opportunities for Quebec to look forward to anything since the Dominion of Canada was created. EOS BOS Confederation, for Quebec, means 150 years of being constantly undermined by the decisions taken in the House year after year. EOS BOS It was here that, during the First World War, the federal government temporarily granted itself the right to tax Quebeckers' income. EOS BOS The war is over, all the heroes who fought it have been dead for a long time, but we still pay half of our taxes to this government, even though it barely delivers any services. EOS BOS All this to have the power to decide on provincial jurisdictions, when the provinces are the ones that deal with publicly funded services and are accountable to Quebeckers. EOS BOS The reality of one hundred years of holding our people hostage is an anniversary that federalist parties would prefer to ignore. EOS BOS It was also here in the House that federal politicians voted to prevent Quebec from controlling broadcasting by taking away a portion of our government's jurisdiction over culture, education, and information. EOS BOS The current government's agreement with Netflix is the unfortunate proof that it is bent on meddling incompetently in areas that are supposed to be under Quebec's jurisdiction. EOS BOS Rendering history and reality meaningless, the Canadian Constitution essentially denies the existence of the Quebec nation. EOS BOS Even now, we refuse to sign this pact whose sole intention is to force our distinct society to fall in line every time we try to do things our own way. EOS BOS This is where the Clarity Act was passed, an authoritarian law that undermines Quebeckers' right to the most basic expression of democracy. EOS BOS Today's celebration is about weakening Quebec's position in the Canadian parliamentary system. EOS BOS The day before Confederation, Quebec held half the seats in Parliament. EOS BOS The day after, it held a third of them. EOS BOS Now we have less than a quarter. EOS BOS When the very first sitting of the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada took place on November 6, 1867, the first subject of debate was the appointment of the first Speaker of the House of Commons. EOS BOS The elected representatives had been together for barely 10 minutes when a member from Quebec was forced to complain because John A. MacDonald wanted to appoint a unilingual anglophone Speaker. EOS BOS That member found it unfortunate that, at the inauguration of Confederation, greater respect was not shown. EOS BOS I am sure he would have fallen off his chair had he known that, 150 years later, we would still be having this kind of debate. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a huge honour for me to rise today as we celebrate the 150th anniversary of this House of Commons. EOS BOS [English]
              I am overwhelmed and grateful for my colleagues that there is an opportunity for the Green Party to mark the 150th sitting of the Parliament of Canada. EOS BOS I want to acknowledge that we are on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin nation. EOS BOS We all are very grateful for the perpetual generosity of indigenous peoples in our country to be willing to consider our meek efforts at reconciliation. EOS BOS I note that at 150 years old, our democracy here, the first meeting of Parliament on November 6, 1867, was a bit late. EOS BOS One hundred years earlier, the first parliamentary representative democracy in North America met in Nova Scotia. EOS BOS In 2008, Nova Scotians celebrated the 250th. EOS BOS Imagine that I can stand here today, on our 150th occasion, in the presence in the gallery of four extraordinary Canadians, each of who I hold in such respect and affection. That the Right. Hon. John Turner, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney, and the Right Hon EOS BOS . Paul Martin would be here for this celebration, as well as our former Speakers, John Bosley and Peter Milliken, is an extraordinary moment. EOS BOS [Translation]
              I want to reiterate how proud I am. EOS BOS I find it incredible that I have the privilege to participate, because it is indeed a privilege, not a right. EOS BOS [English] EOS BOS Even as we look back at Halifax and the 250th anniversary, we are all pikers. EOS BOS The longest continuous participatory democracy on the planet is the 800-year-old Iroquois confederacy of the Haudenosaunee. EOS BOS We have learned parliamentary democracy. EOS BOS We have learned that Parliament comes from the word parler. EOS BOS We know we are here to speak with each other, work together, respect each other, and to work to earn the respect of our constituents who have sent us here not to blow our own horn, but to carry their cares and concerns to this place. EOS BOS I could not agree more with our right hon. EOS BOS Prime Minister that one of the greatest parliamentarians I have ever had the privilege to know and work with left us too soon when we lost Arnold Chan. EOS BOS It is his words I think of today, that call in his last speech, the last time he had the physical strength to stand in this place, for us to respect each other. EOS BOS I also ask us to look around. EOS BOS We are in this room, what a privilege, day in and day out, but how often do we look up, and I am afraid I am going to go in a Friendly Giant direction, look way up? EOS BOS There is a reason that this magnificent chamber dwarfs its occupants. EOS BOS This room is not about us as members of Parliament. EOS BOS This room is about democracy. EOS BOS It is about Canada. EOS BOS We are very tiny in this space because our role is to represent something far bigger than ourselves. EOS BOS We are here for Canada. EOS BOS We are here for a country in which we are blessed to live, know, and love. EOS BOS We are to cherish that democracy. EOS BOS This room dwarfs us for a reason. EOS BOS (1535)
              [Translation]
              Thank you to all of my colleagues and thank you Canada. EOS BOS Congratulations and thank you. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. EOS BOS Please indulge me for a few seconds. EOS BOS For the historical record, while it was the first meeting of the Parliament of Canada here some 150 years ago, it was not the first meeting that took place in this very chamber some 150 years ago. EOS BOS The very first meeting that took place was the last session of the Parliament of the United Province of Canada, which met here for its last time before Confederation. EOS BOS I would like that to be noted because this building has a very deep history indeed. EOS </s> BOS While this may not be a point of order, it is a good point of history. EOS BOS I thank the hon. member for Wellington— EOS BOS Halton Hills for it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are going to sign a tax information exchange agreement with Cook Islands, a well-known tax haven. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance is justifying this by saying that it will make it harder for the wealthy to hide their money, but that is false. EOS BOS The only thing the agreement will achieve is allow the wealthy to avoid paying taxes. EOS BOS By signing such agreements, Canada is standing in the way of the international community in the fight against tax havens, which have even been condemned by the U.K. finance minister. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Finance stop helping her rich Bay Street friends hide their money in tax havens? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is strongly committed to protecting the fairness of the Canadian tax system. EOS BOS That is why we have invested nearly $1 billion over the past two years to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS Our unprecedented investments are showing real results. EOS BOS We recovered $13 billion last year, 122 Canadian taxpayers named in the Panama Papers are being audited, and criminal investigations of certain taxpayers are already under way. EOS BOS We will have other announcements to make later today. EOS BOS We are working very hard, and the net is tightening. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in his apology to the LGBTQ2 community yesterday, the Prime Minister acknowledged that there is still much work to do. EOS BOS A bill to expunge criminal convictions for consensual sexual activity between same-sex partners has been introduced. EOS BOS However, the bill to make the age of consent the same for everyone has been languishing on the Order Paper for a long time now. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister commit to working with us to pass both of these bills before the House rises for the holidays? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday was an important day for everyone in the the House, for all Canadians, and for future generations. EOS BOS Recognizing the harm we did as an institution and as a country to members of the LGBTQ2 community was essential. EOS BOS However, as the member said, there is still much work to do. EOS BOS We will keep moving forward with changes to our laws, practical changes that send a clear message to the LGBTQ2 community that the discrimination and harm they were subjected to will never happen again. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after yesterday's historic apology to the LGBTQ community and with the answer we just had from the Prime Minister, we see an opportunity here to begin to address some of the unfinished business the Prime Minister has been talking about. EOS BOS In order to do that, will the Prime Minister join us in seeking agreement from all members of this House to deal with Bill C-66 before Christmas, so that gay men with criminal records for same-sex consensual activity can have those records extinguished? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member opposite for his long advocacy for human rights, for LGBTQ2 rights, and for the rights of all Canadians over many years. EOS BOS It was an honour to stand with him in this House yesterday. EOS BOS As the member mentions, there is still much work to be done and we look forward to working with all members of this House to get it done as quickly as we can. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the chair of the veterans affairs committee. EOS BOS Tomorrow he has scheduled a secret meeting, but we are supposed to be hearing from witnesses in public. EOS BOS Liberals submitted a list of witnesses concerned about the cuts, people and organizations like the ombudsman, the Royal Canadian Legion and many others. EOS BOS Why is the Conservative chair holding secret meetings? EOS BOS Are the Conservatives plotting to cancel public hearings? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, had the member listened— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Veterans Affairs. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I was interrupted by the red kindergarten. EOS BOS Had the member been attentive at the last committee meeting, he would have clearly understood that we are maintaining and investing in our veterans. EOS BOS We are doing that with skilled professionals who are working in our department, in Charlottetown, in our regional office, and with the full support of this government because we support our veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canadians learned that my colleague, the member for Mount Royal, was barred from a reception in Israel during the Prime Minister's trip. EOS BOS We can thank the member for York Centre for the shabby treatment of a man who deserves greater respect. EOS BOS Today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is heading for Ukraine. EOS BOS However, the Canadian delegation does not include MPs from other parties, even though all parties share the same concerns about Ukraine. EOS BOS What message are we sending Ukrainians about multi-party democracy when our government excludes members from other parties? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's decision to send a Canadian delegation to Ukraine is yet another example of Canada's leadership on this issue, but the NDP members wanted to wait and see. EOS BOS They did not want to take sides. EOS BOS In fact, they criticized us for taking sides. EOS BOS The Liberals actually thought this whole thing was a joke. EOS BOS That is why we are sending people there who have been engaged in this issue, who treat it seriously, and they are standing with the Ukrainian people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the previous government always ran a trade surplus while the current government has 49 months of a trade deficit. EOS BOS It is also weak on jobs, both in quantity and quality. EOS BOS When CIBC reported that reality, the finance minister simply trashed it. EOS BOS CIBC is a sham, he said. EOS BOS However, it is not just CIBC. EOS BOS The same jobs analysis came from TD Bank, the Bank of Canada, the OECD, Morgan Stanley, York University, the PBO and many others. EOS BOS Are they all lying? EOS BOS Are all of them a sham? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to disappoint the hon. member, but what the Parliamentary Budget Officer actually said is that this government has cut taxes by $3,400 for the average family, with a disproportionate amount of that money going to low- and middle-income families. EOS BOS Those lower taxes have helped create 1.2 million net new jobs, 80% of them full-time, 80% of them in the private sector and two-thirds in high-paying industries. EOS BOS The Liberal one-point plan for the economy is to raise taxes on families and job creators. EOS BOS We will not let them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a threadbare government in abject denial. EOS BOS It has increased taxes in each of its last five budgets. EOS BOS It has the worst growth record in eight decades. EOS BOS Job creation is only half of what the previous government achieved. EOS BOS Job quality is the worst in 25 years. EOS BOS One third of those soon retiring have no savings. EOS BOS Consumer debt is the highest ever. EOS BOS Federal debt has grown by nearly $5,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. EOS BOS Does the minister not understand that a big majority of Canadians want something new, different and better than this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is exactly the kind of question—Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. The member has asked a question. EOS BOS I am sure he is quite keen to hear the answer. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Employment and Social Development. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is exactly the kind of question that we would expect from a party whose leader thinks budgets will just balance themselves. EOS BOS Here are the facts. EOS BOS Income taxes are down by 10% and after-tax incomes are up by 10%. EOS BOS In fact, they are up by 14% for the lowest-income families. EOS BOS We have lowered taxes by $3,400 for the average family of four, we have balanced the budget, and we have the lowest debt by far as a share of our economy of any of the G7 economies. EOS BOS We are going to continue with our economic action plan because it is working. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the member for Peterborough  was under scrutiny, he told his constituents and local media that he would be coming forth with his records. EOS BOS Unfortunately, he has not fulfilled this promise. EOS BOS We all know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister rightfully owes his constituents and Elections Canada an explanation, but they are not getting it. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister force his parliamentary secretary to step aside and take action toward reducing the cloud of Conservative corruption that hangs over the government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member has already submitted his elections filings. EOS BOS It was almost four years ago. EOS BOS He has since fought a second election campaign and he has not heard anything from Elections Canada suggesting that there is a problem with any of the audited and verified filings that he has already submitted. EOS BOS The real issue is that members of the Liberal Party, like their friends in the NDP, are voting against an economic action plan that has already helped to create 700,000 net new jobs, that is growing the economy, that will help us become one of the only countries in the world to balance our budget without raising taxes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is obvious the government has traded in its old ethics spokesperson and has a used one out for a test drive. EOS BOS The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport  gained experience at political polling while he owned 3D Contact and did work for some 24 Conservative candidates in the 2006 election. EOS BOS Could the member explain to us how he paid $21,000 in during the pre-writ period and reported only $1,500 out during the election period? EOS BOS We have all seen this in and out scheme before. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for yet another thoughtful and mature question here on the floor of the House of Commons. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Peterborough has followed all of the rules. EOS BOS He has submitted the documents. EOS BOS They have been audited and verified. EOS BOS He has not heard anything to the contrary from Elections Canada. EOS BOS He has conducted himself honourably in the House and on behalf of his constituents. EOS BOS That is something which not all members of the opposition can say for themselves. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week, the Liberals announced the revival of the court challenges program. EOS BOS This program will fund court challenges based on freedom of religion, democratic rights, liberty, and security. EOS BOS Restoring this program is a good step that is long overdue, but the government should enshrine it in law. EOS BOS Liberals need to keep their promise to stop fighting first nations families, veterans, and mothers in court. EOS BOS I have a simple question for the minister. EOS BOS Will the Liberals enshrine this program in law so that these groups and future groups can access justice and keep fighting for fairness, and when will they do it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to protecting human rights and official languages rights. EOS BOS In the context of the cross-country consultations on official languages, Canadians highlighted the importance of ensuring access to the legal system, which is why we reinstated the court challenges program, a program that has made a real difference in the lives of Canadians. EOS BOS In order to get the program up and running right away, it was important to do it in the way that it has been done. EOS BOS The possibility of enshrining it into law is one that could be considered at a later date. EOS BOS However, in order to get these rights available to be supported, it has been necessary to do it in the way that it has been done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP voted for increasing taxes on the wealthiest Canadians, but he is right, we did oppose a plan that did nothing to help the middle class. EOS BOS [Translation] EOS BOS This morning, the government dropped gangsterism, trafficking, importation of narcotics, weapons possession, kidnapping and other charges against 36 individuals arrested during a major anti-Mafia sweep. EOS BOS My question for the Prime Minister is as follows: why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is important that we ensure that our justice system works to keep Canadians and their communities safe. EOS BOS We are always working to improve our justice system so that criminals are prosecuted and face the consequences of their actions. EOS BOS There is still work to do to improve the system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we should mark that down on the calendar. EOS BOS It seems as though the Liberals kept a campaign promise. EOS BOS A new report has found that Marine Atlantic, a crown corporation operating ferries between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, is receiving taxpayer subsidies and forcing out private marine shipping from the market. EOS BOS Marine Atlantic's role is to provide fair and reasonable services, not to put close to 1,000 jobs across eastern Canada at risk through its heavily subsidized and heavily discounted rates. EOS BOS What is the minister doing to ensure a level playing field for all of our shippers in Atlantic Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is dedicated to ensuring Canadians have an integrated and sustainable transportation system. EOS BOS The ferry service connecting Newfoundland to the mainland serves as a critical economic and social link and a visible element of Canada's constitutional mandate to connect the province to the rest of the country. EOS BOS We are committed to Newfoundlanders having safe, efficient, and reliable ferry services to the mainland. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at committee the Minister of Small Business said that the Liberals' promise to reduce taxes on small business was “a great sound bite” and “a great headline”, but at the end of the day, they were not really going to do it. EOS BOS My goodness, the old Liberal arrogance is alive and kicking. EOS BOS First they steal an NDP policy, then they abandon that promise in their very first budget, and now the minister is bragging about it. EOS BOS Will the Liberals do the right thing tomorrow and reinstate the tax break for small businesses, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians elected our government on a plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class, and we are delivering on that commitment. EOS BOS Over the last six months, almost 220,000 jobs were created, the majority of which were full-time and the majority of which were created by small and medium-sized enterprises. EOS BOS This is the strongest six months of job growth in almost a decade. EOS BOS This is evidence that our plan is working EOS BOS . 
              We will continue to make the necessary investments in budget 2017 to continue to strengthen the middle class and to grow the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's inconsistency will never cease to amaze us. EOS BOS In Canada, the only plug-in hybrid minivan available is the Chrysler Pacifica, manufactured here by our unionized workers in Windsor. EOS BOS This is a fine opportunity for the National Capital Commission to purchase one and to show it off to all the tourists who come to Ottawa to celebrate Canada 150 right here, in front of the Parliament buildings. EOS BOS Well, no, that will not happen. EOS BOS The National Capital Commission's two new minivans run on gas only. EOS BOS What a missed opportunity. EOS BOS Can someone tell me why we want to hide our finest technological achievements? EOS BOS These are not made in China. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, it is Canada’s 150th anniversary and tomorrow we are kicking off the celebrations. EOS BOS It will be June 21, National Aboriginal Day. EOS BOS Then we will have the day celebrating Quebec and the Canadian Francophonie, Canadian Multiculturalism Day, and finally Canada Day. EOS BOS I encourage all members in the House and all Canadians to celebrate Canada Day and to show off the best technologies that are proudly Canadian and that of course help in our fight against climate change. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how does the minister explain the unfair treatment of Quebec when it comes to the cuts at Canada Post? EOS BOS The cuts in Quebec are alarming at 53%, when elsewhere in the country they are only 4% to 8%. EOS BOS How does the minister explain that Quebec is not entitled to the same postal service as the rest of the country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is a crown corporation that is at arm's length from the government. EOS BOS In fact, all Canadians are entitled to the same service from this corporation, but we will not interfere in the day-to-day management of this organization. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is avoiding questions on the cuts at Canada Post and continuing to give vague answers. EOS BOS Can the parliamentary secretary finally tell us why Quebec is being so unjustly penalized? EOS BOS Postal service is crucial across the country. EOS BOS Why is this government abandoning Quebec? EOS BOS Quebeckers deserve an answer. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, it is the New Democrats who tried to extend a work stoppage at Canada Post. EOS BOS They are the ones who contributed to the interruption of service to Quebeckers and all Canadians. EOS BOS It is our government that took action to ensure that Canada Post's services are available to all Canadians across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canada Post office in Dorion, Ontario, is also about to close, forcing families to drive up to 75 kilometres just to pick up a package, despite the fact that Canada Post has claimed that there is a moratorium on the closure of rural post offices. EOS BOS Postal service is vital for rural families and especially seniors in communities like Dorion. EOS BOS They should not need to drive almost an hour just to get to the post office. EOS BOS Would the minister stand up and assure Dorion families that post offices will not close? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is a crown corporation, independent from the government. EOS BOS It does provide services to Canadians coast to coast. EOS BOS Those services are provided regardless of region and without discrimination. EOS BOS We will not interfere in the daily operations and management of an independent crown corporation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what kind of leadership is that?Rural Canadian communities, like Dorion, are being left out in the cold by Canada Post. EOS BOS Last year alone, despite its promised moratorium on such closures, Canada Post padlocked postal outlets in 37 different towns. EOS BOS Thousands of families are cut off from the rest of the country, even while Canada Post raked in $233 million in profit. EOS BOS When will the minister and the government stand up for rural communities? EOS BOS When will they stop robbing them of their needed postal services? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously, we are standing up for rural communities. EOS BOS That is why the government is working to eliminate the wasteful long gun registry that has harassed farmers and hunters for far too long. EOS BOS That is why we are giving freedom to western farmers. EOS BOS On the subject of Canada Post service, it is a little rich for the NDP, which attempted to prolong the work stoppage at Canada Post, to now stand in the House of Commons and claim that it wants to extend the services. EOS BOS It wanted to prevent Canadians from any region of the country from having Canada Post service by prolonging that work stoppage. EOS BOS Thank goodness our government stepped in and ordered it back to work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the first quarter of this year, opioids killed over 900 Canadians. EOS BOS The government needs to help. EOS BOS The Liberals gave only $10 million to fight the opioid crisis but has no problem giving $500 million to the Asian infrastructure bank. EOS BOS Why is the government sending $500 million to foreign billionaires, when we have Canadians dying in our streets by the hundreds? EOS BOS Canada is our home. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the member opposite has given us an opportunity to talk about some of the things our government is doing to address the opioid crisis. EOS BOS For example, our government has provided $10 million in urgent support to our provincial partners in British Columbia and $6 million to the Province of Alberta to assist with its response. EOS BOS That is in addition to $22.7 million ongoing of the $100-million commitment in budget 2017 to support national measures associated with the Canadian drugs and substances strategy to respond to this terrible health crisis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are over 65 million refugees fleeing persecution around the world. EOS BOS Countries like Canada have a responsibility to ensure that we do our part to support and provide refuge to those in need of protection. EOS BOS On this World Refugee Day, can the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship please advise this House on the government's commitment to refugee resettlement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member from Scarborough—Rouge Park for his work as an advocate for refugees. EOS BOS On World Refugee Day, I am proud of our government’s commitment to welcome those fleeing war, terror, and persecution. EOS BOS [English]
              As a government, we responded to the largest refugee crisis in half a century by admitting 40,000 Syrian refugees. EOS BOS We restored refugee health care that was callously cut by the previous government. EOS BOS We tripled the number of privately sponsored refugees. EOS BOS As a former refugee, and on behalf of the Government of Canada, I applaud the generosity of Canadians who day in and day out assist refugees. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have a quote of the member for Brant of April 14. EOS BOS He stated, “ EOS BOS The Canadian Wheat Board...should be decided upon in terms of its existence by the farmers themselves in a plebiscite or a vote as to whether it should continue with the mandate it was originally given”.If the member for Brant can understand this basic principle of fairness and democracy, what on earth is wrong with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food? EOS BOS How can he let the members who are in conflict of interest vote on the future of the Wheat Board when he will not allow the same right to the very prairie farm producers who rely on it for their economic well-being? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have a tremendous quote here, too. EOS BOS Let me put this on the record. EOS BOS It states, “when the government is intending to change the legislation, I honestly don't see the grounds for going to court. EOS BOS The government has the right to change the legislation. EOS BOS I don't see the case for taking it to court”.That was said by the member for Winnipeg Centre. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's proposed dismantling of the Wheat Board is already having a negative impact on Churchill. EOS BOS Things are already being cleared out of the port. EOS BOS People are being told that shipments will not be coming through. EOS BOS They are worried about losing their jobs and having to uproot their families. EOS BOS Why is the government creating chaos and uncertainty in communities like Churchill and communities across the Prairies? EOS BOS When will it put aside the interests of big agra and stand up for western Canadians and their communities? EOS </s> BOS What we are trying to do on the government side, Mr. Speaker, is bring clarity and certainty to the grain industry in western Canada. EOS BOS What is not helpful is when the chair of the Wheat Board, Allen Oberg, and his seven friends from across western Canada bring uncertainty to this role. EOS BOS That is the problem that we are having with Churchill. EOS BOS Those guys are implementing a scorched earth policy, trying to prove the inevitable by simply being intransigent to this change that we are trying to bring. EOS BOS Freedom to western Canadian farmers is priceless. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to respectfully ask the Minister of Industry if he was of sound mind when, on September 12, he said that the Conservatives broke their promise to Quebeckers to compensate the Quebec government with $2.2 billion by September 15 because the province is refusing to tax items such as books, baby feeding supplies and diapers. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a joint press release was issued by the Province of Quebec and the Government of Canada. EOS BOS This shows that we have been negotiating on this issue in good faith from the outset. EOS BOS Things are moving forward and are going well, as the finance ministers for both Quebec and Canada have said. EOS BOS It is time to stop nitpicking and look at the result. EOS BOS It is on the way. EOS BOS Those members over there were in power for 13 years and always said that the sales tax could not be harmonized. EOS BOS We get things done, and we will keep our promise. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, to strip someone of their Canadian citizenship is a very serious matter. EOS BOS Stephen Harper's Bill C-24 took away due process for Canadians, even in the case of an honest mistake. EOS BOS The Liberals promised a full repeal of Bill C-24, but so far they have failed to deliver. EOS BOS In fact, the government is aggressively pursuing citizenship revocation for up to 60 Canadians every month. EOS BOS When will the minister fix Bill C-24? EOS BOS Will he halt citizenship revocation until fairness has been restored? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Bill C-6 adheres to our fundamental election commitment that a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, and it revokes citizenship revocation for criminal acts applied to dual citizens alone. EOS BOS That was the central focus of the bill. EOS BOS It has now passed through the House of Commons and will be considered in the Senate. EOS BOS Citizenship revocation for misrepresentation is under consideration and we are considering further lines of appeal. EOS
BOS Clearly, Mr. Speaker, cutting services to Canadians is becoming the operating policy of the government. EOS BOS However, the consequences for Canadians do not end with service cuts and job losses. EOS BOS In Borden-Carleton, P.E.I. and across Canada, the minister is moving rapidly to privatize the records management division of the CRA, risking the protection and security of documents. EOS BOS Why is the minister putting at risk sensitive financial and medical records and turning record storage over to minimum-wage employees? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we do not keep medical records. EOS BOS We are the department of national revenue. EOS BOS I want to make sure that is clear. EOS BOS Our top priority, of course, is the economy, which includes making sure that Canadian tax dollars are spent wisely. EOS BOS This change will ensure the privacy and security of taxpayers' records and will do so at a lower cost. EOS BOS We must ensure that taxpayers' money is spent where it will do the most good. EOS BOS In any event, more and more Canadians are moving to electronic services. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that the number of homicides committed with long guns has decreased, the Conservatives have decided to turn a deaf ear with regard to the firearms registry. EOS BOS They are turning their backs on women, victims, the police, the victims' ombudsman and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. EOS BOS They are even going to destroy the data in their ideological blindness. EOS BOS Why destroy $2 billion in accumulated information when the provinces and the police want to keep it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is true that we are getting rid of the ineffective and useless long gun registry. EOS BOS I agree with a number of experts on that. EOS BOS [English]Let me quote someone who said, “ EOS BOS I have always believed that the gun registry is a failure in principle and a failure in policy, and that we could have done much better with different policies.” EOS BOS Who said that? EOS BOS It was the member for Sackville—Eastern Shore. EOS BOS Another member said, “ EOS BOS My intention is to see the wasteful long gun registry ended.” EOS BOS Who said that? EOS BOS It was the NDP member from Thunder Bay. EOS BOS Another member said, “ EOS BOS I've always opposed the long gun registry because I thought it was unfair to law-abiding firearms owners.” EOS BOS Who said that? EOS BOS It was the NDP member for Thunder Bay—Rainy River. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, new information released today by Statistics Canada shows that homicides in Canada are at a 45-year low. EOS BOS The main factor is fewer deaths caused by rifles. EOS BOS Yet, on this very day, the Conservative government wants not only to turn its back on police, but also to burn all the data that helps keep the homicide rate in Canada low. EOS BOS Why is the government putting a divisive ideology ahead of our communities' safety? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the registry has done nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. EOS BOS In order to protect the privacy of law-abiding long gun owners, records held by the Canadian firearms program on currently registered long guns will be destroyed. EOS BOS Let us be clear. EOS BOS The only reason the NDP wishes to retain these records is to reinstate the long gun registry whenever it is in the position to do so. EOS BOS What we will do is abolish the long gun registry once and for all. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister's answer is no excuse to destroy life-saving data that would help police keep our streets safe. EOS BOS The Conservative government's plan is tantamount to a $2 billion bonfire. EOS BOS It wants to destroy the data that police use 17,000 times a day and which the police have asked the government to keep. EOS BOS The police deserve a fighting chance against gun crime in Canada. EOS BOS If provinces also want to maintain this information for their own use, they should have the right to do so. EOS BOS Why is the government handcuffing law enforcement in Canada by burning all the records? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as one woman from the Georgian Bay Women's Outdoors Workshops stated:As a woman, the long gun registry does not make me feel any safer or more secure. EOS BOS It is wasteful, ineffective and reduces funding to do real things. EOS BOS The 2 billion dollars that have already been spent would have been better used on programs like healthcare, childcare, women's issues and allocating moneys to policing agencies to fight criminal and real crime. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, listen to this capability gap. EOS BOS In October, the Liberals invited veterans from the Somalian and Afghanistan wars to give heart-wrenching testimony about side effects and the impact they experienced from being forced to take mefloquine. EOS BOS When the committee tabled the report to the House, veterans were shocked to see that the vast majority of witness testimony was stripped out. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we stand with veterans, and that is why we tabled the witness testimony so that Canadians could hear the truth. EOS BOS Will the minister commit to not only responding to the committee but also to the countless hours of heartbreaking witness testimony? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the health and wellness of veterans and their families is at the core of what we do. EOS BOS I am proud of the fact that committee members looked at all of these issues, because they, too, are committed to the health and wellness of veterans. EOS BOS I can tell the member that I have not yet had an opportunity to review the whole report. EOS BOS I will be doing so and looking into how we can fold in some of the ideas to best support veterans and their families that lead to better outcomes for their success. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, workers and families in Canada's resource sector feel abandoned by their Prime Minister. EOS BOS Thousands of intelligent, hard-working and talented Canadians are unemployed. EOS BOS The Prime Minister can give them hope by voting in favour of our motion that supports the energy east project. EOS BOS Will he do the right thing and show his support for workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, every member of the House knows that there are Canadians who are suffering from job losses because of low commodity prices. EOS BOS They are suffering in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick. EOS BOS We need to establish a credible process that will have the confidence of Canadians. EOS BOS The previous government, from 2011, built no pipelines because the process was not credible. EOS BOS We are in a better position today than we were a week ago. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what is concerning is the Prime Minister's track record so far on these issues. EOS BOS Northern gateway, of course, was approved with over 200 conditions and the proponent was working to meet those conditions, but the Prime Minister killed it by unilaterally announcing a transportation ban off the west coast. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS It is because he does not actually value these jobs. EOS BOS If energy east and other projects do manage to get approved through this new process, how can he be trusted? EOS BOS He will politically interfere again and unilaterally kill more jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the hon. EOS BOS member brought up the matter of trust. EOS BOS It was a lack of trust in the regulatory process under the Conservatives' regime that resulted in no pipelines built to tidewater from 2011. EOS BOS We have consulted widely across the country, across sectors, and across regions, and we believe that today we have a better chance of instilling confidence among Canadians than we had when they were running the show. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, workers and families in Canada's resource sector are feeling completely abandoned by the minister and the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Tens of thousands of smart, hard-working, and yes, resourceful Canadians are out of work. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has a chance to offer those people some hope tonight. EOS BOS He can vote in favour of the Conservatives' motion to support energy east. EOS BOS Will he do the right thing and show these people that he has their backs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there will be hope when Canadians are faced with a regulatory regime that has their confidence, and that will only be done if we meaningfully consult with indigenous communities, with industry, with environmental groups, and across regions of the country. EOS BOS With good process and good regulatory controls, we have a much better chance of being where all members of the House want to be: moving our resources to tidewater sustainably. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservative import tariffs are forcing Canadian hockey families to pay $200 more to suit up their kids in hockey gear than American families pay. EOS BOS Tomorrow, on Black Friday, thousands of Canadian families will head south of the border to buy hockey gear to avoid this Conservative hockey tax. EOS BOS That creates American jobs in American cities. EOS BOS Why will the finance minister not give Canadian families a break this Christmas, help Canadian retailers and get rid of this job-killing hockey tax? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his insightful question. EOS BOS I thought we were in football season, but I guess we are moving toward hockey. EOS BOS Our government has reduced tariffs and taxes on Canadians. EOS BOS That brings the cost of everything down. EOS BOS We also put in place a fitness tax credit for parents who want to enrol their children in sports. EOS BOS However, if I recall, I think everyone on that side of the House voted against that as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, La Presse reported that, since 2010, the percentage of bilingual employees at security checkpoints in almost all major airports in the country has dropped dramatically. EOS BOS This information is consistent with a report submitted just today by the Commissioner of Official Languages that reveals the provision of bilingual services in our airports leaves much to be desired. EOS BOS What does the Minister of Canadian Heritage intend to do to promote bilingualism and to ensure that our official languages truly enjoy equal status in airports across the country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, bilingualism and the Official Languages Act are extremely important for our government. EOS BOS Federal services must then be provided in both official languages. EOS BOS We take that very seriously. EOS BOS We are of course responsible for safety in our airports, but we insist that it be done with respect and courtesy, and in accordance with the Official Languages Act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, more details have now emerged about the Prime Minister's New Year's vacation. EOS BOS Taxpayers now know they are on the hook for over $120,000, and that is not even counting whatever the numerous ethics investigations are going to cost. EOS BOS The Prime Minister made a conscious decision that it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to pay for his luxury travel. EOS BOS When did the Prime Minister forget that it is his job to serve Canadians and not the other way around? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as has been the case for previous prime ministers, including the previous one, for security reasons RCMP officers always accompany prime ministers, whether for personal or business travel. EOS BOS One of the first things we did after taking office was to ask the Clerk of the Privy Council Office to develop guidelines surrounding the reimbursement for travel by sitting prime ministers, their families, and guests. EOS BOS Prior to our government taking office, no such policy existed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, lots of Canadian families travel by plane on a special getaway once a year. EOS BOS On these flights, one could buy a sandwich or maybe a diet Coke and a bag of chips for a snack. EOS BOS It is not great, but it is certainly reasonable. EOS BOS What is not reasonable is over $1,700 worth of food and drinks for a three-hour flight between Canada and the Bahamas, which is how much the taxpayer was billed by the Prime Minister getting to his private island vacation. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS Just what in the world was the Prime Minister eating on that plane ride? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the work that we do in this place and for Canadians we take very seriously. EOS BOS As I have mentioned, and as has been the case for previous prime ministers, for security reasons, RCMP officers have always accompanied prime ministers, whether on personal or business travel. EOS BOS One of the first things we did when we took office was to ask the Clerk of the Privy Council to develop guidelines surrounding the reimbursement of travel by sitting prime ministers, their families, and guests. EOS BOS Prior to our government taking office, no such guidelines existed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the immigration minister's fine words are nothing but a smokescreen. EOS BOS Instead of increasing the number of refugees being settled, as it promised, the government admitted 25% fewer refugees than the previous year. EOS BOS The year 2012 now has the dubious distinction of having the second-lowest number of refugees in the past 30 years. EOS BOS Why has the minister broken his promise to welcome more refugees to Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have done no such thing. EOS BOS We are increasing the number of refugees who settle in Canada and thus strengthening our humanitarian tradition of immigration and refugee protection. EOS BOS Just yesterday I was in Iraq. EOS BOS We are accepting about 4,000 Iraqi refugees each year. EOS BOS That said, the civil war in Syria has led to the closing of our office in Damascus, and that has affected the processing of these Iraqi refugees. EOS BOS We are working on a solution to this problem over there. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as usual, there is no answer, and the ministry's own figures today belie the facts. EOS BOS The truth is that the minister has been saying one thing and doing another on refugee resettlement. EOS BOS They are nowhere near meeting even the minister's own targets. EOS BOS It is the world's most vulnerable who pay the price for this mismanagement. EOS BOS One million refugees have fled Syria and half of them are children, yet the minister still refuses to meet with the Syrian community. EOS BOS Why is the minister abandoning refugees? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have met with dozens of members of the Canadian-Syrian community here. EOS BOS Just yesterday, I met with members of the Syrian community in Baghdad. EOS BOS I can tell the member that we have committed to the largest refugee resettlement program out of Syria in the world, starting four years ago, specifically for Iraqis who had fled sectarian violence, and have welcomed 20,000 over five years. EOS BOS This country welcomes one out of every ten resettled refugees worldwide, the highest per capita number in the world. EOS BOS We are increasing that number, but it is true that we have had technical problems because of the civil war, which we intend to resolve. EOS BOS We take lessons from no one. EOS BOS We are leading the world with respect to refugee protection. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday in committee RCMP Commissioner Paulson made some strong statements about the abuse that women were facing in the RCMP. EOS BOS For too long, women officers have suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of their co-workers, while senior officials have looked away. EOS BOS The commissioner seems committed to dealing with what has come forward in terms of harassment and abuse. EOS BOS What steps will the government take in order to stand by the RCMP and ensure that an end is put to the harassment and abuse women are facing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on her new position. EOS BOS Like all Canadians, I am extremely troubled by these reports. EOS BOS I indicated this several months ago in the House already. EOS BOS RCMP members must be free to face the daily challenges of protecting our streets and communities without the fear of harassment or intimidation. EOS BOS That is why, in consultation with the commissioner, I have referred this matter to the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP. EOS BOS As there is pending litigation as well at this time, it would be inappropriate to comment further. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, these cases are urgent and the scope is grand. EOS BOS We want to see the minister and his government act immediately. EOS BOS Women in the RCMP have suffered harassment and abuse because they are women, something that is unacceptable in any workforce across the country. EOS BOS We are talking about a broader culture in the RCMP, and without the resources and the public commitment of the minister today, nothing will change. EOS BOS Will the government take a tough stand and show some real action to end the harassment and abuse women face in the RCMP? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I indicated several months ago on this file, we are extremely concerned about the troubling reports of sexual harassment in the RCMP. EOS BOS That is why we took the steps we did. EOS BOS We asked the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP to investigate allegations of systemic failure to deal appropriately with sexual harassment within the force. EOS BOS It is imperative, as I have indicated, that RCMP officers be in a position to conduct their jobs in keeping Canadians safe without concern about harassment. EOS BOS I am very pleased that the commissioner has taken this issue very seriously. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, speaking of news, Bloomberg news quoted the following: “Feelings Are Worth Spending For”—finance minister on the eve of budget. EOS BOS The Prime Minister would agree. EOS BOS He was feeling pretty good when he spent $127,000 in tax dollars on his visit to billionaire island. EOS BOS That was a real middle-class adventure, by his definition. EOS BOS Do the Liberals know who is not feeling good, though? EOS BOS It is the tomato farmer in my riding, who had to pay $6,200 in one month for a carbon tax. EOS BOS When will the government realize that its feelings are not worth hammering taxpayers with more costs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to taking action that will grow the middle class and create good jobs. EOS BOS Action on climate change is estimated to grow the world economy by $19 trillion through investments in renewable power and energy efficiency. EOS BOS We understand the need to trade good jobs to protect our environment, grow the middle class, and ensure a more sustainable future for our kids. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, for no reason, the government announced it would wait two more years before introducing pay equity legislation. EOS BOS The Canadian Labour Congress says: After all the expert testimony, and with the Task Force and Committee’s recommendations in hand, it’s unacceptable that the government would decide to make women wait another two years for pay equity legislation. EOS BOS It is a human right. EOS BOS Women should not have to wait until 2018 for the government to act. EOS BOS Will the minister introduce proactive pay equity legislation before the end of this year? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am so glad for the opportunity to indicate to this House that this is a government that is not going to sit on the sidelines when it comes to pay equity. EOS BOS For 12 years, the previous government did nothing. EOS BOS We are proud to say that we are implementing proactive pay equity legislation. EOS BOS We are moving on it, from the day we got elected. EOS BOS Now we are going to be bringing in legislation to make it happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is 2016. EOS BOS Yesterday, the government told Canadian women that they would have to wait a bit longer for equality. EOS BOS Pay equity is a fundamental right. EOS BOS Canadian women have already waited far too long for their rights to be respected. EOS BOS The pay equity task force released its report on this 12 years ago. EOS BOS Enough is enough. EOS BOS Why is the Liberal government holding up justice for women? EOS BOS Will the government take immediate action and introduce a proactive bill on pay equity by the end of 2016? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the federally regulated industries that are included in the proactive legislation include 874,000 employees and 10,800 employers. EOS BOS All of them need to be consulted and worked with, a process that is complicated and will take some time. EOS BOS We do want to have understanding and co-operation from the private sector, and we are working hard to make this as reasonable as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under the guise of finding efficiencies, the minister responsible for Service Canada has carved the guts out of her department. EOS BOS Part-time and casual workers are long gone and nearly 90 permanent employees who have left since July have not been replaced. EOS BOS Add to the backlog of calls that are already there 18,600 new unemployed Canadians this month, and we get a sense as to the backlog of work and the demand on Service Canada workers. EOS BOS However, this minister has the gall to blame the workers. EOS BOS It is not the workers at Service Canada, it is the management, or should I say the mismanagement. EOS BOS When is someone on the government bench going to wake up and-- EOS </s> BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Human Resources. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our goal is to help get benefits to Canadians in need just as quickly as possible. EOS BOS To do that, we are overhauling the system. EOS BOS We are automating where we can, so that people can get more accurate service more quickly. EOS BOS We are doing everything we can to help the good employees at Service Canada fulfill their jobs and help Canadians in their time of need. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as Dr. Phil would say, “ EOS BOS How is that going for you”?The call centre industry that is driven by productivity has a standard of 85% occupancy. EOS BOS Occupancy is when an agent is actually on the phone, engaged with a phone call. EOS BOS At Service Canada it has been for quite some time at 99%. EOS BOS The people at the other end of the phone, the clients, they are not there trying to upgrade their cable package or order a pizza. EOS BOS They are looking for a cheque. EOS BOS They want to feed their families. EOS BOS They want to pay their bills. EOS BOS However, the mismanagement we have seen at Service Canada is denying them the money that is their money— EOS
BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are trying to ensure that Canadians do get their cheques faster, do get their deposits faster. EOS BOS That is why we are changing the system. EOS BOS We know it needs fixing. EOS BOS We know that the employees at Service Canada need more help to achieve their goal of helping Canadians. EOS BOS That is why, in our budget, we included funds to help put in new computer systems that are going to speed up the process. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the hon. EOS BOS member and his party voted against that help. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, practically everyone in Quebec has condemned the energy east project. EOS BOS Today, the Federation of Quebec Municipalities is joining in. EOS BOS This project threatens our rivers, lakes, and farmland. EOS BOS Under this project, Quebec assumes all the risks without any of the benefits. EOS BOS Do you know who is not standing up to defend Quebec on this project? EOS BOS Obviously, as usual, it is those who do not stand up for our people, the 40 phantom MPs of the Liberal Party. EOS BOS When will these 40 phantom MPs stand up to defend Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the member will have every opportunity to express that view and the view of his colleagues to the National Energy Board, which will be spending the next 21 or so months reviewing every aspect of that pipeline proposal. EOS BOS Surely, he would not want us to make a decision before he has had a chance to tell the National Energy Board what he thinks. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise on behalf of the official opposition to ask the government what it has planned for the House for the remainder of this week and next week. EOS BOS (1510)[English]The government seems to have lost control of the legislative wheel this week. EOS BOS I will review for Canadians. EOS BOS The Conservatives tried unsuccessfully to ram Bill C-27 through. EOS BOS Thankfully, the official opposition took a principled stand against this and forced them to step back from shutting down the debate. EOS BOS The finance committee has rewritten its own ridiculous rules on how to deal with the Conservatives' monster budget bill, Bill C-45. EOS BOS The committee is now sitting around the clock to deal with this sham of a process, which the Conservative government has set up. EOS BOS [Translation]Yesterday, instead of standing up for victims of bullying, most government members shamefully decided to side with the aggressors who bully and torment Canada's most vulnerable young people. EOS BOS It was a shameful demonstration of the importance the Conservatives attach to their partisan principles, at the expense of common sense. EOS BOS [English]I guess the only question I have for the government today is the following: How many more abuses of our democratic processes does the government have planned for this week and the one to follow? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is true that we have experienced some disruptions yesterday and today as a result of efforts by the Liberal Party to disrupt our agenda. EOS BOS I was puzzled as to why it was happening right now at this time. EOS BOS However, a news story just broke, which gave me some insight into it, where the young member for Papineau said that: Canada isn't doing well right now because it's Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda. EOS BOS It doesn't work.... EOS BOS When he was asked if Canada would be better served if Quebeckers were in charge rather than Albertans, he said: I'm a Liberal, so of course I think so.... EOS BOS Certainly when we look at the great prime ministers of the 20th century, those that really stood the test of time, they were MPs from Quebec... EOS BOS This country--Canada--it belongs to us. EOS BOS Obviously, the Liberals do not want to see the Conservatives governing, advancing our agenda or advancing our budgetary agenda. EOS BOS Therefore, I think that answers the NDP House leader's question as to why we are facing these delays right now in the House. EOS BOS However, we will carry on, Albertans and all, and the rest of the country, with Conservatives from coast to coast in this government trying to advance the agenda that Canadians believe in EOS BOS .
							 We will resume the second reading debate on Bill S-2, the family homes on reserves and matrimonial interests or rights act, this afternoon. EOS BOS Tomorrow we will conclude report stage of Bill C-27, the first nations financial transparency act, and third reading will take place on Tuesday. EOS BOS We will start second reading debate of Bill C-47, the northern jobs and growth act, on Monday and the debate will continue on Wednesday. EOS BOS The finance committee is working very hard to go through Bill C-45, the jobs and growth act. EOS BOS I commend them for their efforts. EOS BOS Our budget implementation legislation contains important measures, such as extending the hiring credit for small businesses, expanding tax relief for investment and clean energy, helping Canadians save for retirement with pooled registered pension plans and improving the registered disability savings plan. EOS BOS However, I do confess that it does not include the NDP's carbon tax or its proposal for a 1% GST increase. EOS BOS Perhaps that is why its members are opposing it. EOS BOS In any event, we hope to start report stage consideration of Bill C-45 on Thursday, if at some point the Liberals give up on their disruptive delay objective and agree to allow someone other than the member for Papineau to have some say in running the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last night the Commissioner of Elections Canada told the House that some election fraud investigations would have to be scrapped if the Conservatives’ unfair elections act were ever passed, and we know which ones they are. EOS BOS There is the David Del Mastro case, the robocall voter suppression fraud, and investigations against the Conservative Party where Conservative witnesses have refused to co-operate. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister shutting down Elections Canada investigations into Conservative electoral fraud? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, exactly the opposite is true. EOS BOS The bill would give more independence and greater power to the commissioner. EOS BOS Obviously, all matters, including the various irregularities that we have seen under the NDP, will be investigated. EOS BOS What does not fall under Elections Canada, but does fall under the House, is to investigate the wrong use of parliamentary monies by the NDP for a bunch of party offices across the country. EOS BOS That money should be returned to taxpayers. EOS
BOS It would be an honour for me, Mr. Speaker, to appear before that committee. EOS BOS Would the Prime Minister do the same to explain about his guests on the Challenger?Elections Canada has been investigating Conservative voter suppression fraud for over two years. EOS BOS When it was Dimitri Soudas being investigated for using the Conservative database for his fiancée, the investigation took two days. EOS BOS Why will the Prime Minister not give Elections Canada the power it needs to also compel Conservative campaign operatives to co-operate in its investigation? EOS BOS Is it because it works? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the commission will have all normal investigative powers. EOS BOS We are not asking the leader of the NDP to try to explain away this misuse of parliamentary funds. EOS BOS What we are asking him to do is pay it back. EOS BOS Those parliamentary funds are not supposed to be used to run party offices. EOS BOS He should take those people off the payroll and pay back the taxpayers of Canada the money that they are owed. EOS
BOS There is an old proverb, Mr. Speaker, “be careful what you wish for”.
							[Translation]Let us make a comparison. EOS BOS It takes the Prime Minister two days to find out that Dimitri Soudas unlawfully used the Conservative database, but after two years we still do not know who committed the greatest electoral fraud in the history of Canada. EOS BOS Why will the Prime Minister not give Elections Canada the power it needs to investigate fraud? EOS BOS Is it because he is afraid it will work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the commission will have all normal powers to deal with such situations. EOS BOS Since we are talking about party matters, I note with interest that the NDP is making inappropriate use of parliamentary funds to run party offices elsewhere in the country. EOS BOS When will the leader of the NDP pay back taxpayers for using public funds? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday Londoners and Canadians learned that the RCMP has charged Liberal insider, Joe Fontana with breach of trust by a public officer, fraud and uttering forged documents. EOS BOS He was charged after it was revealed he allegedly stole taxpayers' money from the House to pay for his son's wedding. EOS BOS For several weeks, government members have called for Liberal members to condemn this theft, but Liberals have refused to do so and continue to protect their friend. EOS BOS Can the parliamentary secretary update the House on our government's commitment to respect taxpayers' dollars? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, sadly, this is not the first time that the Liberals have stolen money from Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS We all remember the tens of millions of dollars they stole through the sponsorship scandal, which helped put their party in the far corner over there. EOS BOS At his press conference today, Liberal insider Joe Fontana was asked if he had heard from former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin. EOS BOS Liberal insider Joe Fontana's response was, "No comment".Canadians want to know, did Liberal insider and former Prime Minister Paul Martin advise Joe Fontana to stay on as mayor? EOS BOS Do the Liberal members opposite agree with us that it is time for their friends to resign? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the course of question period, the minister of heritage clearly held in his hand what appeared to be copies of correspondence from MPs to the government, but not likely to himself. EOS BOS It is the custom of the House for ministers who reference documents and quote from them to table those documents. EOS BOS Clearly, the minister and backbenchers have been provided access to correspondence from members and individuals, information to which they were not entitled. EOS BOS Were all obligations met under the Access to Information Act? EOS BOS Furthermore, will the government table the documentation related to both the Access to Information Act and Privacy Act that allows them to circulate correspondence from members to individuals who did not give authority to allow them to provide that information to members? EOS BOS There is a serious matter here, but related to question period, the minister clearly held in his hand documentation, which was referenced not to his department but to HRSD, relating to the temporary foreign workers program. I ask that the minister table those letters in the House. EOS </s> BOS I imagine that there is a possibility that we will hear back from the minister on this point, but at this time, since I do not want to point out the presence or absence of a member, perhaps we will wait and see if the minister does come back to the House to address this point. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the closure of Target in Canada represents a loss of 17,000 jobs in 133 municipalities. EOS BOS It also affects 1,800 suppliers who are owed over $5 billion by Target. EOS BOS The list of creditors is 44 pages long. EOS BOS Some suppliers will not recover. EOS BOS The Conservatives have failed to diversify our economy, and Canadians are paying the price. EOS BOS I will ask the government once again: where is the plan to fight the downturn and stimulate job creation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are obviously all worried about the number of people who have lost their jobs with Target after two years of failure by this American company in Canada. EOS BOS We have contacted employees to provide all the services they need, including employment insurance, obviously, training programs and job notifications. EOS BOS We will continue to help unemployed workers while creating jobs with our low-tax policy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the retail sector has often served as a lifeline for workers in other sectors who lose their jobs. EOS BOS However, even these jobs are disappearing. EOS BOS Furthermore, January and February are not good months to be looking for a job in the retail sector. EOS BOS Where is the government's plan for all these people looking for work who must continue to pay their bills? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, we obviously continue to provide access to the employment insurance program and the training programs that we have enhanced. EOS BOS We will soon be launching a new job bank that will better match unemployed workers with employers who are hiring. EOS BOS We are working with the provinces to ensure that training programs are better aligned with the labour market. EOS BOS Ultimately, we must continue to reduce taxes in order to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a lot of these workers are part-time, and they do not qualify for EI. EOS BOS That is the problem they have created. EOS BOS Job losses are mounting, retail stores are closing, and the Conservatives have no plan and no budget. EOS BOS A hundred and thirty-three Target stores start liquidation tomorrow. EOS BOS Seventeen thousand, six hundred people are losing their jobs. EOS BOS Hundreds of other retail stores are closing, thousands more jobs will be lost, and the minister thinks if he just ignores it, it will go away. EOS BOS Well, it will not. EOS BOS Canadians need a plan. EOS BOS Where is their plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our plan has resulted in one of the best job creation records. We have developed, with the creation of 1.2 million net new jobs, one of the best economic growth records of any of the major developed economies. EOS BOS I do not know what the NDP is suggesting. EOS BOS Obviously we are all concerned for the employees of Target, but is the NDP suggesting that the taxpayers should subsidize this failed American retail outlet in Canada? EOS BOS We do not believe so. EOS BOS To the contrary, we believe we should continue reducing taxes to create economic growth and to create jobs rather than adopting the NDP approach of higher taxes, reckless spending, and bigger debts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that plan is not working. EOS BOS The job losses are piling up, and middle-class families are falling further behind. EOS BOS On top of thousands of jobs lost in retail, 383 workers at Wrigley Canada just found out that the Wrigley manufacturing plant in Toronto is closing. EOS BOS They are losing their jobs, and the Conservatives have no budget and no plan to fix the damage they have done. EOS BOS When will they do the right thing and agree to the NDP's plan to kick-start manufacturing and job creation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, actual people who work in manufacturing in Canada, looked at the NDP plan that my colleague is talking about, and they said that the NDP plan will put investment and jobs at risk. EOS BOS By contrast, here is what they said about the Conservative approach. ... EOS BOS the programs the Conservative government has put in place do support manufacturing, and do it very well. EOS BOS We have had the misfortune in this country, in British Columbia and Nova Scotia, a couple of places that have had an NDP government, and we know what the NDP plan and approach is for small business. EOS BOS If someone wants to create a small business under an NDP government, it is quite easy: start a large business and just wait. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, allegations of corruption at the Canada Revenue Agency have been making the news for six years now. EOS BOS The Minister of National Revenue refuses to say what is going on at the agency because there is an RCMP investigation. EOS BOS But yesterday, a senior official at the agency confirmed that concrete measures were in place to combat corruption. EOS BOS Why is the minister refusing to tell us what the measures are? EOS BOS Does she have something to hide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government does take this allegation of misconduct very seriously. EOS BOS We will not tolerate this type of activity. EOS BOS We are co-operating fully with the RCMP investigation. EOS BOS It is important to note that many of these allegations go back more than a decade. EOS BOS The RCMP is working its way through the criminal justice system. EOS BOS Of course, the integrity of our tax system is critical to all of us. EOS BOS I would, please, ask the hon. opposition to let the RCMP do the work. EOS BOS We believe that it can move forward and will get answers in due course. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, chapter 13 of O'Brien and Bosc, under “Rules of Order and Decorum”, on page 614, indicates that a member cannot do indirectly what cannot be done directly. EOS BOS It is obviously referring to quoting from newspaper articles, etc. EOS BOS I would argue that it should also hold to members saying, “ EOS BOS Any member who”, and making a statement about the member. EOS BOS Last Wednesday, following question period, in response to a point of order raised by the member for Mégantic— EOS BOS L'Érable regarding an inappropriate personal comment made about him by the Prime Minister in response to his question that day, you had indicated that you would check the Hansard and get back to the House if you deemed it necessary. EOS BOS I will point out that this is not the first time--in fact, it is the third time at least,--hat the Prime Minister has had a point of order raised regarding his behaviour in question period. EOS BOS On two previous occasions, it was in relation to his taunting of female members of Parliament who were asking questions. EOS BOS You indicated that you would check and get back to the House. EOS BOS In those cases, it is possible that his behaviour was not recorded on camera. EOS BOS However, in this case, it would be something that you could check, because it was made while he was responding to a question. EOS BOS Given that past record of deplorable behaviour, the fact that this has been raised, and you indicated you would get back to the House and also given that it is not permissible to do indirectly what is not permissible directly, I would ask if you have had the chance to do the review and advise the House of your ruling. EOS BOS If you decided that it was not necessary to report back to the House, I would ask that you give us your justification for that, Mr. Speaker. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. member for Banff— EOS BOS Airdrie for the supplemental information EOS BOS . I will look into it and will come back to the House if necessary. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to return to presenting reports from committees. EOS BOS The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration's 12th report is now ready, with dissenting reports appended. EOS BOS The opportunity to ensure it is presented in the House before the summer adjournment would be appreciated by all members of the committee. EOS </s> BOS Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I hope to finally get a real answer to a question here today. EOS BOS Since 2007, the Liberals and the Senate have been asking the Conservative government to take its Senate reform to the Supreme Court to confirm its constitutionality. EOS BOS We firmly believe that Bill C-7 would paralyze Parliament, that it would be unfair to Alberta and British Columbia, and that it is unconstitutional, because Parliament alone cannot change the character of the Senate without the support of the provinces. EOS BOS Will the minister come to his senses and submit his Senate reform to the Supreme Court? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government tabled the Senate reform act in order to limit the terms of senators and to give Canadians a say in who represents them in the Senate. EOS BOS We, on this side of the House, are committed to making the Senate more democratic, accountable and representative of Canadians. EOS BOS This legislation is already before the courts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago, torrential downpours and landslides in Sri Lanka created a humanitarian crisis across the island. EOS BOS Over 600,000 people have been displaced from their homes, and nearly 250,000 people are stuck in emergency evacuation centres. EOS BOS The crisis is ongoing and individual victims need our help. EOS BOS Over 100 people are still reported missing and 100 more have been confirmed dead. EOS BOS Could the hon. EOS BOS Minister of International Development advise the House of Canada's efforts to assist these victims? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge Park for the question. EOS BOS I would like to begin by offering our deepest condolences to the people of Sri Lanka and expressing Canada's solidarity with them. EOS BOS Our government acted swiftly by making a $310,000 contribution, which helped Oxfam Canada and the Red Cross provide water, sanitation and hygiene services, household items, living allowances, and protection to some 50,000 affected families. EOS BOS We continue to monitor the situation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as the House knows, legitimate trade and travel passing through the Canada-U.S. border is incredibly important to the success of our economy. EOS BOS Throughout our mandate, our Conservative government has taken strong action to work with the Americans to ensure that our border is open to officially process legitimate travel and trade but that the door is slammed shut to criminals, terrorists and human smugglers. EOS BOS Would the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety please update this House on what our government is doing to make travel to and from the U.S. more efficient? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's top priority is creating jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. EOS BOS The border action plan is designed to speed up legitimate trade and travel and improve security in North America. EOS BOS Today the Minister of Public Safety announced enhancements to the NEXUS program, including increasing benefits to NEXUS members, streamlining the NEXUS membership renewal process and launching a plan to increase NEXUS membership. EOS BOS This is good news for travellers and good news for the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, emails released to the Ottawa Citizen today show that on the day of the shooting on Parliament Hill in October, Canadian military leaders were saying that the event presented a “strategic opportunity” to affirm Canada's participation in the war in Iraq. EOS BOS Subsequently, senior officials expressed the desire to appear alongside Ottawa Police at a press conference the next day. EOS BOS These are emotional times for all, but would the government agree that describing the events on Parliament Hill as a strategic opportunity is regrettable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said right from the start, we are in a battle with ISIL and the terrorists. They were the ones who declared war on Canada and her allies EOS BOS . We will continue to confront them head on. EOS BOS I am proud of the job our Canadian Armed Forces are doing in Operation Impact. EOS BOS Whether it is the air task force or our special operations forces, they are aiding, assisting and providing the advice that is required by the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish peshmerga. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to an email exchange obtained by the Ottawa Citizen, one of the Prime Minister's military advisers described the October 22 attacks in Ottawa as “a strategic opportunity” to affirm the purpose of the Canadian military mission in Iraq. EOS BOS Does it seem normal to the government that on the day of the attacks in Ottawa, people in the Langevin Block were thinking about scoring political points and justifying the war in Iraq rather than focusing exclusively on the safety of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know the NDP is opposed to protecting the innocent people of Iraq who have been brutalized and terrorized by ISIL. We will continue to work with our Iraqi security forces and our allies in this coalition to defeat ISIL, and ensure it is not able to bring its brand of terrorism to us in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of the Environment admits that climate change is a danger that needs to be addressed. EOS BOS However, he has manipulated accounting rules, used projected values instead of actual emissions and taken credit for provincial and territorial actions rather than tabling a comprehensive climate change plan. EOS BOS Will the minister admit that his sector by sector approach is nothing more than a delay tactic and will the government bargain in good faith at next week's UN meeting on climate change? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our accounting methods for our sector by sector approach to responsibly regulating Canada's emitting sectors have been recognized and accepted internationally. EOS BOS We are half way toward accomplishing our Copenhagen 2020 reduction targets. EOS BOS I will go to Doha quite proudly next week to re-engage partners from around the world because climate change is a global problem and requires a global solution. EOS BOS However, I can assure my colleague that Canada is doing its part. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is scandalous that more Canada Post corporate outlets are being closed. EOS BOS We have learned that one of the few remaining corporate outlets, on Boulevard Sainte-Foy in Longueuil, will soon close. EOS BOS This bad decision has consequences for the people in my riding. EOS BOS They will have to travel as far as Brossard, or even to Montreal, to obtain postal services, and this is very worrisome for our seniors. EOS BOS It also means that jobs are in jeopardy. EOS BOS Will the minister assume his responsibilities and maintain public services? EOS BOS Will he stop further job losses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to universal, effective and economically viable postal services for all Canadians. EOS BOS That is why we introduced the Canadian postal service charter and we are protecting all rural post offices from closure. EOS BOS Canada Post is experiencing changes as the economy changes. EOS BOS Decisions have been made in some urban centres to realign post office hours, times and locations. EOS BOS However, may I say that they are working very hard and Canadians have never had better postal service than they do today. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last night the House passed my Bill C-483. EOS BOS The bill would ensure that the Parole Board of Canada would make decisions related to the release of prisoners on escorted temporary absences. EOS BOS It would stop the process of allowing unaccountable bureaucrats the authority to make decisions about who could leave prison. EOS BOS The bill came about as the result of an absurd decision to let a convicted cop killer out of prison after he had already been denied parole. EOS BOS The widow of the police officer, Kim Hancox, was fully supportive of my legislation. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please update the House on the bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I sit with the member for Oxford who not only brought forward the bill, but who has also been a great police officer. EOS BOS I was pleased to see nearly all members of the House support this important bill. EOS BOS I wish the leader of the Green Party would have supported it. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because it is another way to give a voice to victims. EOS BOS Also, I hope the other place will adopt the bill so it can come into force rapidly. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Toronto is the latest city to join others in Canada and across North America in banning the sale and use of shark fins. EOS BOS Up to 75 million sharks are finned and thrown away at sea every year, often while still alive. EOS BOS Will the government work with us to end this practice and ban the import of shark fins to Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, shark finning is an offensive practice. EOS BOS It has been banned in Canada since the early 1990s. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, among Arnold Chan's last words to the House were these:
              
                
                  It is imperative that we stop treating climate change as solely an environmental issue but recognize it as an all-encompassing priority that we as a society and a government must confront with the utmost urgency. EOS BOS The environment commissioner's report yesterday made transparent what most of us know: that we are not there, that we are not acting with urgency, that we are not acting. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister use this occasion to commit to a reset to actually reduce emissions with urgency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member opposite for her many years of advocacy and for being a staunch defender of the environment and of our future. EOS BOS A year ago this week, I stood in the House of Commons and announced, for the first time in Canada, a national price on carbon pollution that would go from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS This is the kind of leadership that we never saw from a previous government. EOS BOS We know there is a lot more to do. EOS BOS We continue to work diligently on protecting the environment and growing the economy together in ways that will benefit future generations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Yakunin, a member of Putin’s inner circle, is on the U.S. sanctions list, but is still not on Canada’s list. EOS BOS When she was in opposition, the member for University—Rosedale asked the Conservative government: “ EOS BOS When will the government match its actions to its rhetoric and sanction Sechin and Yakunin?” EOS BOS Now that the member is the Minister of Foreign Affairs, my question for her is this: when will the government walk the talk and sanction Mr. Yakunin? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the member that it was the Conservatives who did not sanction Mr. Yakunin in 2014 and 2015. EOS BOS Now Mr. Yakunin is no longer in power, just like the Conservatives. EOS BOS This is an important reality. EOS BOS As for our position vis-à-vis Russia, I think all members in this House would agree with me when I say that our government’s opposition, as well as my own as Minister of Foreign Affairs, remain very strong. EOS
BOS I recommend the minister read his own law. EOS BOS [Translation]This government, in the name of standing up for victims, is forcing a misguided crime bill on us that is based on personal observations instead of scientific studies. EOS BOS So much for being tough on crime. EOS BOS The only study they have is from Justice Nunn, an expert on youth justice. EOS BOS This study does not have to do with every aspect of Bill C-10. EOS BOS In fact, this judge has been very critical of certain provisions of this bill. EOS BOS Could the government give us just one scientific study in support of this bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have had input right across the country. EOS BOS I was very pleased, for instance, to get the input of the NDP in Manitoba, which has encouraged us to move forward on these initiatives. EOS BOS I can see that does not impress the hon. member. EOS BOS The bill is very targeted. EOS BOS It goes after drug traffickers and those who would molest children. EOS BOS It sends out the right message. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member talks about victims. EOS BOS I am proud to be a part of the only party that stands up for victims and law-abiding Canadians in our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians were very hopeful that the inquiry into murdered and missing aboriginal women and girls would lead to a brighter future, but families are losing patience. EOS BOS It has now been eight months, and we now hear that the commissioners only have 90 names in their database, yet hundreds and hundreds of families are waiting to hear from them. EOS BOS The minister needs to take action. EOS BOS There are some very simple fixes to this issue. EOS BOS She needs to break down bureaucratic barriers and ensure that the inquiry gets the necessary information to do its job. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on this ongoing national tragedy, we are confident that the commission has the tools, resources, and networks to provide the families with the support they need. EOS BOS I can confirm that government officials are scheduled to meet with the commission to discuss how best to utilize the information resources already provided. EOS BOS We remain steadfast to our commitment and will continue to work collaboratively with all parties to ensure the commission is ready to hear from families this spring. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is no reason to do away with Quebec's consumer protection legislation. EOS BOS This Prime Minister seems perfectly comfortable in not keeping his word, whether it is on forming the most ethical government on the planet, or his solemn promise to change the electoral system—and he has been in power for only one year. EOS BOS My question for the Prime Minister is very simple. EOS BOS Does he think it is important to attend question period? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a prime minister has a tremendous amount of responsibilities, and a large part of those responsibilities is to come to the House to take questions from his colleagues. EOS BOS However, I am also very pleased to have an extremely strong cabinet. EOS BOS They are here to answer questions related to their portfolios. EOS BOS I am also very proud to be constantly engaged with Canadians across the country to listen to their concerns and work with them to build a stronger future. EOS BOS We are committed to building a stronger and more successful middle class. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have spent $13 million already on a witch hunt against Canadian charities that disagree with them. EOS BOS Now the Canadian Bar Association is warning that loopholes in the Criminal Code could allow the Conservatives to target legitimate charities and accuse them of funding terrorists. EOS BOS People are worried that the real target here are the charities that disagree with Conservative policies. EOS BOS Will the government fix the loophole instead of leaving the law open to abuse? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canada Revenue Agency is focused on ensuring that money is not flowing to terrorist organizations that seek to harm Canadians. EOS BOS This is part of our commitment to keep Canadians safe from those who wish to further the goals of the international jihadist movement. EOS BOS In fact, the Prime Minister recently announced additional resources to further strengthen the CRA's ability to crack down on those who would seek to abuse the generosity of Canada's charitable sector. EOS BOS Unlike what the opposition would have us do, we will not sit on the sidelines; we will address the threat that is upon us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what the minister just said is the opposite of the truth. EOS BOS The Canadian Bar Association says that the section of the Criminal Code on terrorist financing is unclear. EOS BOS Charities that do legitimate work in affected areas could be targeted, and now the government wants to spend another $10 million to investigate these charities. EOS BOS That borders on McCarthyism. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives clarify the Criminal Code to ensure that no charities are unfairly targeted? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the rules regarding charities and their activities are long standing and well known. EOS BOS When it comes to the issue of terrorist financing, I am amazed the opposition members would not want us to do the job before us. EOS BOS That job is to focus on ensuring that the money is not flowing to terrorist organizations that mean to do harm to Canadians. EOS BOS Canada has been named by the international jihadist movement, and the movement remains a threat to Canadians and the safety of our communities. EOS BOS These additional monies will further strengthen our abilities to look at terrorist financing, and we will continue to address this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a recent audit from the Department of National Defence confirmed that despite the government's repeated public announcements about creating a squadron of long-range drones based at 5 Wing Goose Bay, DND rather indefinitely delayed the program due to a lack of oversight, a lack of information, and unclear objectives. EOS BOS I ask the Minister of National Defence why the government is making repeated public announcements for programs at 5 Wing Goose Bay with no real intention of delivering on those commitments. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is constantly reviewing, as are our Canadian Armed Forces, all of our services and all of the ways we can enhance the way we defend and protect our country. EOS BOS I would like to remind the member that it is our government that has been able to purchase a number of additional pieces of equipment, including new Leopard tanks, new C-17 tactical lift aircraft, and new Hercs. EOS BOS We have the national shipbuilding program and the Harry DeWolf Arctic offshore patrol vessels that are going to be built. EOS BOS All this is going to enhance the security of our nation and provide the resources that are needed by the members of the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Diamond Aircraft had a solid order for 240 jets worth $400 million, private sector funding and a loan guarantee from the Ontario government. EOS BOS All that was needed to secure hundreds of jobs and a place for Canada in the modern aerospace industry was a commitment from the federal government. EOS BOS That commitment was denied. EOS BOS It was a major blow to job creation and to the London families that depended on those jobs. EOS BOS Could the minister explain to the people of London why Diamond Aircraft was refused funding? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to congratulate the member for her re-election and thank the people of Cambridge and North Dumfries for re-electing me to this great House. EOS BOS The Government of Canada has already invested some $20 million into this company, through the strategic aerospace and defence initiative. EOS BOS However, as stewards of taxpayer dollars, it would not be judicious to increase that amount by another $35 million. EOS BOS After a thorough review of Diamond's request, the company was advised by this government that we could not support the request. EOS BOS The company has other alternatives that it is exploring. EOS BOS We wish it well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada understands how important mining exploration companies are to supporting middle-class families and indigenous communities and to building a clean, green economy. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Natural Resources tell the House about what the federal government is doing to ensure that Canada remains a top destination for exploration and mining? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Nickel Belt for his excellent question.
              I recently announced that our government will extend the 15% mining exploration tax credit for an additional year. EOS BOS The credit helps exploration companies finance their projects and contributes to creating good jobs in remote and indigenous communities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, many veterans struggle in finding meaningful employment after leaving the service on transitioning to civilian life. EOS BOS The Liberals promised to engage with stakeholders like Monster.ca to use military skills translators to help our vets find work, including jobs in the public service. EOS BOS The U.S. uses this same algorithm to help its soldiers find jobs, but we have heard nothing from the Liberals on this campaign promise. EOS BOS Could the minister explain, with a real answer for veterans, why the Liberals are dragging their feet on this campaign promise? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his commitment to veterans across Canada. EOS BOS We are committed to finding veterans more work in both the public sector as well as the private sector. EOS BOS Since the passing of the Veterans Hiring Act in 2014, we have brought on board a mandate, through me, to the rest of my cabinet colleagues, as well as the deputy ministers, to look at more ways to hire more veterans. EOS BOS We are also investigating opportunities with the private sector to build those bridges and get those opportunities for our veterans and their families to better their lives. EOS BOS We will continue to do that in our department. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign, the Liberal Party promised to respect the federal public service, but the government held no consultations and was not at all transparent about its decision to restructure the Shawinigan tax centre. EOS BOS Many employees, some of them still coping with the Phoenix fiasco, are worried about keeping their jobs. EOS BOS That is a strange kind of respect. EOS BOS Can the minister provide some reassurance to those workers now by telling them that all of their jobs will be protected? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague across the aisle is well aware that there have been meetings with the members concerned. EOS BOS I would suggest that he talk to his colleague, the member for Jonquière, who congratulated us on what we did. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's special LGBTQ adviser said there is no link between an apology to the LGBTQ community and remedies. EOS BOS A year ago, the military ombudsman said that as soon as the minister gave approval he would begin revising service records for veterans who were kicked out for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. EOS BOS A year ago every member of defence committee voted for this process to begin EOS BOS . 
              If there is no link between an apology and remedies, why are these vets still waiting? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all Canadians should be safe to be themselves, love whom they choose, and be free from discrimination of any kind. EOS BOS We have already made significant progress on these issues with Bill C-16 and Bill C-39. EOS BOS Our special adviser on LGBTQ2 issues, the member for Edmonton Centre, has been working hard and consulting broadly with the community to ensure that when an apology happens, it will be thorough and complete. EOS BOS That applies to veterans who are LGBTQ as well. EOS BOS Funds have been allocated for things like the expungement of records. EOS BOS We will be addressing the issues of veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has committed to a long overdue apology to LGBTQ Canadians, but this is the same Liberal Party that promised to eliminate the discriminatory ban on gay men donating blood, and broke that promise. EOS BOS There is no scientific basis for this policy and it constitutes clear discrimination today. EOS BOS How can the Liberals offer a sincere and meaningful apology to the LGBTQ community for past injustices when they are practising discrimination in the present? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, through our efforts over the years, Canada continues to have one of the safest blood systems in the world. EOS BOS In June 2016, we took steps forward in reducing the barriers that prevent men who have sex with men from donating blood. EOS BOS Our government has also committed $3 million to Canadian Blood Services in collaboration with Héma-Québec to make further progress on this issue. EOS BOS This funding helped organize an international health conference on blood donor policy. EOS BOS It will support behavioural research required to develop non-discriminatory practice and encourage the advancement of this technology. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, President Trump wants to axe spending on cleaning up the Great Lakes. EOS BOS The Great Lakes flow into the St. Lawrence, the source of drinking water for millions of Quebeckers. EOS BOS Mayors of communities around the Great Lakes and along the St. Lawrence and environmental groups have reminded us that protecting water should be considered an essential service, but time is running out. EOS BOS Will Ottawa turn its back on Quebec and sacrifice our water, or can the minister assure us that American cuts will not threaten the waters of the St. Lawrence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, while in Washington last week, I met with representatives of both U.S. parties, mayors, and environmentalists. EOS BOS I made it very clear that Canada recognizes our obligation to protect the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence. EOS BOS That is what I told my American counterpart. EOS BOS I was very clear about how vital it is to work with the United States to ensure that the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence remain environmental priorities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite what the parliamentary secretary said yesterday, and despite what we heard earlier today, it is not true that the World Health Organization is blocking the shipment of vaccines to Africa. EOS BOS In fact, the WHO said yesterday:Given the public health need...WHO regards the expedited evaluation of all Ebola vaccines...as a high priority. EOS BOS The WHO says that the Canadian vaccine is one of the most promising. EOS BOS Why is the Conservative government still dragging its feet? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are particularly proud of this very promising vaccine. EOS BOS That is why since day one Canada has been at the forefront of responding to the Ebola crisis. EOS BOS Not only are we contributing $35 million to assist those on the ground, to assist them on general humanitarian grounds, to assist them with nutrition and to provide them with treatment, we are also contributing, of the 1,500 doses that we fully own, up to 1,000 doses to the World Health Organization. EOS BOS It is up to the World Health Organization to decide how it thinks it can best use these doses. EOS BOS Whether it is going to trials or whether it is directly dispensing them, the World Health Organization is in the driver's seat when it comes to those doses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President of Liberia urged Canada to do more as the Ebola outbreak continues to devastate her country. EOS BOS She said there is an urgent need for highly skilled health workers, testing centres and training. EOS BOS The WHO cites that the situation in Liberia in particular continues to deteriorate. EOS BOS Liberia needs strong international support to bring the outbreak under control. EOS BOS Will the Canadian government respond to the plea from the Liberian president? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there is no question that this is a very serious international health crisis and Canada has been showing international leadership. We have contributed $35 million in equipment, direct food and expertise. EOS BOS We have scientific labs on the ground and scientists that rotate through. EOS BOS It is very difficult to put a financial value to that type of humanitarian assistance, and it is very needed. EOS BOS Canada is one of the top 10 contributors throughout the entire crisis to the Ebola response in West Africa and we will continue to show international leadership. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the whole country is very proud of our national microbiology lab in Winnipeg, most recently because of the role that it is playing in the Ebola outbreak. EOS BOS It is a world-class centre for excellence and scientific research, due largely in part to the outstanding performance and directorship of the outgoing national director, Dr. Frank Plummer. EOS BOS However, that was in March. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us why it is taking so long to fill this important position in this important institution and why the job posting looks like the government is contemplating hiring a mid-level bureaucrat instead of a top-notch scientist like Dr. Plummer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the work that is being conducted there at the lab. The job has been posted and as soon as I have an update for the House, members will be hearing about it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago in a statement about the 200 B.C. mining jobs that went to temporary foreign workers, the minister said that she was not satisfied with the process. EOS BOS The company said it followed the rules and would now like to know what she meant, and so would Canadians. EOS BOS Is she saying that the company was dishonest in its application or is she admitting that she did not apply her own rules appropriately? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our goal is to make sure that Canadians get first crack at every job that is available in this great country. EOS BOS That is why employers who want to bring in temporary foreign workers are required to prove that they have made a legitimate and responsible effort to find qualified Canadians. EOS BOS We want to make sure that the process in place for employers to follow does exactly that. EOS BOS That is why we are reviewing it, to make sure that the process will protect jobs for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has already admitted that the process is not working. EOS BOS British Columbians were passed over by a process the government implemented, and this from a party that suggested the unemployed should go and work in a mine. EOS BOS The Conservatives are failing unemployed Canadians. EOS BOS Either the company played by the rules and the process is broken, or the company broke the rules and those are illegitimate visas. EOS BOS Which is it and why will the minister not suspend those visas? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we do want to make sure that Canadians get first crack at all the jobs that are available in this country. EOS BOS That is why we require employers who want to bring in foreign workers to prove beyond a doubt that they have conducted a responsible search for qualified Canadians. EOS BOS We want to make sure that the process is robust enough to support Canadian workers and we are reviewing it to make sure it does just that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we all offer our condolences to the families, too. EOS BOS [Translation]A committee of parliamentarians, regardless of party membership, is but a committee of parliamentarians. EOS BOS It cannot take the place of the Canadian people. EOS BOS However, after reaching an agreement with the NDP behind closed doors, the Liberals and the Prime Minister seem to want to force reform on Canadians. Canadians are realizing that they cannot trust this government. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister bring his minister into line and call a referendum to reassure Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we did listen to Canadians. EOS BOS Over 60% said they wanted electoral reform. EOS BOS What we offered to the people of this country was an all-party committee, which has now been established, to come together and review the options available to us. EOS BOS I am counting on the support of all members of the House, in all the ways that they know their constituents and their ridings, to ensure that the committee's work is enhanced by their efforts as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives take ensuring the safety of Canadians seriously and we also understand the need to balance those concerns with protection for civil liberties. EOS BOS Unfortunately law enforcement and security agencies sometimes have only mere minutes to react to threats. EOS BOS The Liberals' new bill is removing the ability of security agencies to take proactive steps when sometimes just seconds matter. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister want to remove the tools our law enforcement and security agencies need to disrupt threats to Canadians before they happen? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians expect their government to do two things: to protect our rights and freedoms and keep our communities safe. EOS BOS That is the focus of our national security legislation. EOS BOS That is something we are working very hard, with all parties, to ensure we are able to do. EOS BOS We look forward to recommendations, to advice, to amendments from other parties on how to improve that issue. EOS BOS All Canadians know we need to balance security with rights and freedoms. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about air safety. EOS BOS Pilots are reporting an increasing number of drone sightings near airports, including in my riding of Ottawa South. EOS BOS Flying a drone near aircraft without permission is extremely dangerous. EOS BOS Violators could face steep fines and/or jail time. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Transport please update the House on how the government plans to further address this serious and troubling issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with the member for Ottawa South. EOS BOS Air safety is of vital importance and Canada will be a leader in drone safety. EOS BOS Drones are becoming increasingly popular and of significant economic value, but they must also be safe. EOS BOS Consequently, we are looking at the regulations, the classification of drones, drone identification, and the registration of those who want to operate drones. EOS BOS We will unveil these regulations in the coming months. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has become clear that the Prime Minister will not stop his never-ending quest for new revenue streams to pay for his out-of-control spending even for compassionate reasons. EOS BOS Last weekend, we learned that in May 2017, the Liberals began to deny major tax credits to vulnerable diabetics, against the advice of doctors. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister justify funding his reckless spending on the backs of diabetics? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to ensuring that all Canadians can access the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. We fully understand the concerns of these groups. EOS BOS Diabetes affects the lives of many Canadians. EOS BOS The minister's office will be meeting with these groups this week. EOS BOS We are currently hiring nurses to assess disability tax credit applications in the first step of the process, and the minister has asked the Canada Revenue Agency to improve its data collection process in order to better understand the agency's decision-making process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the disability tax credit provides important tax relief for many vulnerable Canadian diabetics. EOS BOS It is pretty simple how it works. EOS BOS The government determines the qualifying criteria, and the patient's doctor certifies whether the patient meets those criteria. EOS BOS The Prime Minister decided that his tax collectors in Ottawa have a better understanding of diabetic patients than their own doctors. EOS BOS This is truly the worst of big Liberal government. EOS BOS Therefore, the question for the Prime Minister is simple. EOS BOS Who is better placed to determine the needs of diabetics, tax collectors in Ottawa or doctors on the ground? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to ensuring that all Canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. EOS BOS We understand the concerns expressed, because many Canadians are touched by diabetes. EOS BOS The minister's office and the agency are meeting with the concerned groups to continue our work. EOS BOS We are rehiring some of the nurses who were fired by the previous government to assess the disability tax credit applications in the first step of the process. EOS BOS The minister has asked the agency to improve its data collection to better understand the decision-making process of the agency. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government does not need to hire more people at the Canada Revenue Agency, it just needs to listen to doctors who are helping their patients. EOS BOS The Prime Minister claims he wants to have a fairer tax system. EOS BOS However, it is now clear that his definition of that word cannot be found in any pages of any English dictionary that I am aware of. EOS BOS Therefore, I am hoping he can help Canadians better understand his new Liberal definition. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us this. EOS BOS Does he believe that raising taxes on vulnerable diabetic Canadians is fair? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in the last election Canadians had a choice: go for the Conservative Party that had continued to not grow the economy very quickly, and gave wealthy people the opportunity to have more benefits; or, go with a Liberal government that is committed to invest in Canadians and to grow the economy by putting more money in the pockets of the middle class. EOS BOS That is exactly what we promised to do. EOS BOS That is exactly what we did. EOS BOS A little later today, everyone is going to see the results of that plan we put in place that is delivering for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister keeps raising taxes on middle-class workers. EOS BOS Families are paying more for things like bus passes, their kids' sports, piano lessons, tuition, and textbooks. EOS BOS Local businesses will also pay more taxes. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister working so hard to make life easier for his millionaire friends, while forcing middle-class Canadians to pay more and more? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we saw last night in Lac-Saint-Jean, Canadians are not buying what the Conservatives are selling. EOS BOS The Conservatives brought in tax credits that did not help families. EOS BOS What we introduced is a Canada child benefit that is giving more money to nine out of 10 families and will lift over 300,000 children across Canada out of poverty. EOS BOS We will continue to keep our promises in order to create economic growth for families. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect, and that is what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of the Environment spent several days in Durban this week, at Canadians' expense, only to sabotage the Kyoto protocol. EOS BOS Any reason is good enough to justify Canada's withdrawal from this agreement, even though it is vital to our planet and future generations. EOS BOS This minister is embedded in the tar sands. EOS BOS He wants to maintain the status quo whereas the rest of the world is moving forward to create a new energy economy. EOS BOS Did the minister go to Durban just for the fossil award? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said in this House many times this week, the Government of Canada supports the development of an agreement that would have all major emitters around the table see real change in GHG emissions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder the minister is in Durban advancing the agenda of his big old friends. EOS BOS That is who he spends his time with. EOS BOS He has met with oil lobbyists almost three times more than he has met with environmental groups, and this is for a Minister of the Environment. EOS BOS Why is it no surprise that, after all these meetings with oil companies, his government still broke its promise to regulate emissions from the oil sands this year? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we seek to understand the viewpoints of all stakeholders with regard to environmental stewardship, which is why we consult industry and environmental groups and why we have a strong sector-by-sector regulatory approach that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and balances both environmental stewardship and economic sustainability. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning, the University of Toronto's international human rights program released a shocking report on Canada's practice of detaining children in medium-security immigration jails. EOS BOS According to the report, Canada detains almost 250 children annually. EOS BOS Some of these children are even held in solitary confinement, in breach of international law and the charter. EOS BOS This is a disgrace. EOS BOS Will the government finally amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and prohibit the detention of children? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, immigration detention is a measure of absolute last resort. EOS BOS That is why we are investing $138 million to both improve the system and minimize its use. EOS BOS We want to avoid the housing of minors in detention facilities as much as humanly possible. EOS BOS I would note that the report the hon. EOS BOS member refers to said this:
              
                
                  CBSA has embarked on several new programs to improve transparency, alternatives to detention, and infrastructure.... the total number of children in detention across the country...has decreased significantly.... EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today is the second anniversary of the first vote on Bill C-51. EOS BOS The Liberals and the Conservatives joined forces to pass a bill that violates our rights and freedoms. EOS BOS History is repeating itself with Bill C-23, which is bad for human rights and Canadians' privacy. EOS BOS The government has admitted that the current pre-clearance system works well, so why is it so determined to forge ahead with giving American officers more powers on Canadian soil? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the point is simply this. EOS BOS Under the pre-clearance system improved by the legislation in Bill C-23, more Canadians will be able to clear customs in Canada before they cross the border, under the full umbrella of Canadian law, the protection of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the protection of the Bill of Rights, and the protection of the Canadian Human Rights Act. EOS BOS That is obviously a far superior process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Camp Ashraf, in northern Iraq, is a makeshift home to political refugees. EOS BOS Those people are opposed to the nearby regime in Iran. EOS BOS Since the fall of Saddam Hussein, they have been protected by the U.S. and coalition forces. EOS BOS However, with the U.S. winding down its operations in Iraq, who is going to protect these people EOS BOS ? Iraq has demanded the camp be closed by the end of the month. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Foreign Affairs please inform the House of his opinion on what is going to happen at Camp Ashraf and of our action on this important file? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate the member for his efforts as a member of the human rights subcommittee. EOS BOS Canada encourages the Iraqi government to extend the closure deadline to allow remaining residents sufficient time to take the required steps to seek asylum, and to allow the United Nations Human Rights Council to consider and process applications. EOS BOS We call on Iraq to meet its obligations under international law EOS BOS . We also want to ensure that Camp Ashraf residents are not forcibly transferred to another country where they could suffer. EOS BOS I can assure the House that my officials and I will be monitoring the situation very closely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a term for someone who commits to something in writing and then reneges on that commitment. EOS BOS It is called a con job. EOS BOS When the Prime Minister got caught selling access to himself and his ministers in exchange for donations to his political party, he decided to let the media attend rather than put an end to the sketchy practice. EOS BOS However, last night, he kicked the media out. EOS BOS Will there be any consequences for the Liberal Party after it broke the Prime Minister's rule on cash-for-access fundraisers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the federal level of government has among the toughest laws on fundraising of any level of government in the country. EOS BOS We will—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I cannot hear the Prime Minister's answer. EOS BOS I would ask the hon. EOS BOS member for Banff—Airdrie to please come to order, along with others. EOS BOS We want to carry on with the rest of question period, do we not? EOS BOS The right hon. Prime Minister. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we take very seriously the strong rules we have with respect to donations to political parties at the federal level. EOS BOS That is why we have actually raised the bar and we have encouraged the other parties to follow suite, to hold our fundraisers in public places, to invite the media, and immediately disclose the list. EOS BOS These are the things the Liberal Party is doing that the other parties have not done yet. EOS BOS When are they going to start being open and transparent with Canadians as well? EOS
BOS “Follow suite”, Mr. Speaker?
              [Translation]
              The Prime Minister himself said that the problem with their fundraising activities was the secrecy surrounding them. EOS BOS We think that selling access to the minister for partisan gain is the problem. EOS BOS Who would have thought? EOS BOS Let us focus for a moment on the Liberals' smokescreen. EOS BOS How can the Liberals claim to have done away with secrecy and to have nothing to hide, when they keep the media out of their fundraisers? EOS BOS It does not add up. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will keep striving to make the work we do in Parliament and within our political parties more open and transparent. EOS BOS We encourage hon. EOS BOS opposition party members to participate openly and transparently in the changes we have made. EOS BOS The media is welcome to attend our fundraising events, which are held in public places. EOS BOS Our guest lists are known. EOS BOS This never happens with the parties across the way. EOS BOS What do they have to hide? EOS BOS We prefer to be open. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while we celebrate World Press Freedom Day, Raif Badawi is still being detained by Saudi authorities for criticizing their regime. EOS BOS One would like to think that our government is doing everything in its power to have him released. EOS BOS In an interview, however, the Prime Minister said that it is important to be discreet and not to push too hard or too fast. EOS BOS He does not want to become personally involved. EOS BOS When it comes to doing business with the Saudis, the Liberals are quick off the mark, but when it comes to ensuring that human rights are respected, there is no hurry. EOS BOS How does the government explain this to Mr. Badawi's wife, who is here in Ottawa today? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague is asking if we are using every means available and doing everything we possibly can to help Mr. Badawi and have him released, since he has done nothing wrong. EOS BOS Yes, that is what we are doing. EOS BOS To increase our chances of success, my colleague will understand if I refrain from commenting any further. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, residents of my riding of Scarborough Centre are working harder than ever, but many are worried that they will not have put away enough money for their retirement. EOS BOS Fewer Canadians have workplace pensions to rely on and one in four families approaching retirement, 1.1 million families, are at risk of not saving enough. EOS BOS Could the minister please inform the House what our government is doing to help ensure Canadians can retire in dignity. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her advocacy on behalf of seniors. EOS BOS Our government is engaged in helping hard-working Canadians achieve a safe and dignified retirement. EOS BOS Earlier this year, we reached a historic agreement with nine provinces to make important improvements to the Canadian pension plan. EOS BOS [Translation]Once fully implemented, this measure will boost Canadians' pensions from a quarter to a third of their income. EOS BOS It will also reduce the proportion of financially vulnerable seniors from 24% to 18%. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we put forward a concrete plan to help the manufacturing sector, especially with an innovation tax credit. EOS BOS The Prime Minister stands there with his arms folded doing nothing. EOS BOS While the NDP proposed tax cuts to help small businesses create jobs—and small businesses create 80% of the jobs in Canada—he gave $50 billion to large corporations for no reason whatsoever. EOS BOS It produced nothing except a windfall for those corporations, which are sitting on dead money. EOS BOS The Conservatives are taking Canada in the wrong direction. EOS BOS What Canadians want to know is this: when is there going to be help for the middle class? EOS BOS When are we going to see a budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me just talk about some of the recent things that I have announced, such as the new programs for small business financing and expansion of those programs. EOS BOS That was something this party supported and something the NDP voted against. EOS BOS I announced record new investments in federal infrastructure to aid federal infrastructure investment over the long term. EOS BOS The NDP was opposed to that. EOS BOS We introduced new measures for apprentices to make sure apprentices are trained for the jobs that are available. EOS BOS The NDP voted against that. EOS BOS All the NDP members do is sit there with their arms crossed, demanding high debt and high-tax policies. EOS BOS We are never going to embrace those. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week we learned that our economy began to shrink in November, back when oil prices were at $75 a barrel. EOS BOS The Bank of Canada recently said that middle-class families in western Canada face falling house prices and job losses. EOS BOS Why is the government giving a $2 billion tax break to those who do not need it, the wealthy, and nothing to those who actually do need it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what this government is doing is bringing in tax reductions and benefits for every single Canadian family, including the expansion of the universal child care benefit so that we not only raise the amount of money we give for those with children under six but also give benefits all the way up to the age of 17. EOS BOS There is the expansion of the children's fitness tax credit, giving more deductions for expense costs that families incur, and, of course, the family tax cut to ensure that single-income families are treated fairly under the tax system. EOS BOS We know the Liberal Party wants to raise those taxes on 100% of those Canadian families. EOS BOS We are going to cut taxes for Canadian families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has cut the infrastructure budget by 90% when the middle class needs investments and better jobs. EOS BOS The Prime Minister insists on giving tax breaks to the most wealthy. EOS BOS That is the wrong priority. EOS BOS The infrastructure investments that the provinces have called for will help all Canadians. EOS BOS However, the Prime Minister wants to help only the wealthiest 15%.Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our priorities are cutting taxes and increasing the universal child care benefit for all Canadian families. EOS BOS I know very well that the Liberal Party has been opposed to these policies for a long time. EOS BOS It wants to raise the taxes paid by Canadian families. EOS BOS That is quite the opposite of our policies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if only that were true. EOS BOS My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, who did not answer my question yesterday about the sponsorship of spouses in Syria. EOS BOS According to his department's website, these sponsorships take an average of 20 months in this country in crisis. EOS BOS I have three questions for the minister. EOS BOS Did the minister send a written administrative directive to his department to make sponsorship files in Syria a priority? EOS BOS If so, when? EOS BOS And since it is not working, what will he do to speed things up? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I answered the question yesterday. EOS BOS I said that we already had. EOS BOS I repeat, we already have. EOS BOS This means that we have fast-tracked processing for sponsorships of spouses in Syria. EOS BOS The vast majority of the cases in the system have already been accepted. EOS BOS I will give the member another opportunity to condemn the comments made by his colleague from Ottawa South, who attacked Alberta MPs, chastising them for defending the interests of their constituents and the Canadian economy and telling them that they should go back to Alberta and not represent their constituents here. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under the guise of being a trade-oriented government, the Conservatives have been ignoring our established markets. EOS BOS First the minister is surprised and disappointed when the United States shuts us out of its market. EOS BOS Now Canada's pork producers have a market worth $300 million at risk in South Korea because of government inaction. EOS BOS Just as with jobs, not losing markets is every bit as important as finding new ones. EOS BOS Why has the minister consistently failed to secure a trade agreement with South Korea? EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is working hard to open up new doors for Canadian farmers, workers and businesses. EOS BOS We recently negotiated further steps toward opening up market access with South Korea on beef and are closely monitoring its domestic implementation process. EOS BOS We will only sign trade agreements that are actually in the best interests of Canadians, unlike the Liberals. EOS BOS In less than six years, we have concluded free trade agreements with nine countries. EOS BOS We continue to work on agreements with 50 more. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the nightmare for taxpayers continues. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Prime Minister doubled down on a failed plan. EOS BOS He promised that if he spent billions of dollars, he would create jobs, but not one single new additional full-time job has been created in Canada since he was elected. EOS BOS What is the Prime Minister going to say to the thousands of Canadians who are out of work, and who only see higher taxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we actually lowered taxes for the middle class, and raised them on the wealthiest 1%, which the members opposite voted against. EOS BOS We know Canadians need help in terms of support for the middle class, but they also need jobs. EOS BOS That is why our historic investments in infrastructure are going to make a significant difference by upgrading and supporting current infrastructure, by creating new public transit infrastructure, green infrastructure, and social infrastructure. EOS BOS These investments will create opportunities for Canadians now and long into the future. EOS BOS That is what Canadians voted for. EOS BOS That is what we are delivering. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has only been six months since his first budget, and the Prime Minister is already back to borrow an extra $32 billion. EOS BOS He has completely abandoned his plan to balance the budget. EOS BOS He does not even pretend to care anymore. EOS BOS He just shrugs his shoulders. EOS BOS We know who is going to pay the taxes for all of this spending. EOS BOS It is going to be hard-working Canadian families. EOS BOS When is the Prime Minister going to start showing them some respect? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to taxes for hard-working Canadian families, we lowered them on the middle class, so we could raise them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS The members opposite voted against the measure to lower taxes on nine million Canadians. EOS BOS We will take no lessons on investing in the middle class and building for the future from a former government that did not get it done for 10 long years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister keeps raising taxes on the middle class. EOS BOS He raised payroll taxes as well as taxes on children's activities and small businesses. EOS BOS He even raised taxes on military personnel. EOS BOS He wanted to tax health insurance plans. EOS BOS Now he has his sights set on taxing public transit, carpooling, beer, and wine. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister refusing to admit that he is hurting the people he claims to be helping? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite can say whatever he wants, but the fact is that we lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS I should point out that he and his party voted against lowering taxes on the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS The Liberal Party, the Liberal government, is lowering taxes on the middle class because the previous government spent 10 years giving the very rich all the advantages. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister does not realize this, but his new tax hikes are hurting Canadians who are having trouble paying their bills. EOS BOS However, that is what happens when one only talks about the middle class never having actually lived it. EOS BOS Wages are stagnating. EOS BOS Canadians are taking on more debt just to keep up. EOS BOS They are getting worried about their homes. EOS BOS Now the Prime Minister is finding new ways to make it harder. EOS BOS New beer and wine taxes, just in time summer, are the latest examples. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister think it is fair to keep shaking down middle-class families so he can spend their money on whatever he wants? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for 10 years, the Conservative government's approach to growth was to give boutique tax exemptions and lower taxes on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS The Conservatives focused on helping the rich and hoping—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I would ask the hon. member for Edmonton Manning and some other members who are not that far away from him to try and restrain themselves. EOS BOS Soon, I am sure, as it is summertime, members will be home relaxing. EOS BOS Therefore, let us try to stay in a good mood here. EOS BOS The right hon. EOS BOS Prime Minister has about 20 seconds. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when the Conservative Party was in government, it focused on helping the richest and not the people who needed help the most. EOS BOS That is why we are so proud of having lowered taxes on the middle class, raised them on the wealthiest 1%, and delivered child benefit cheques to nine out of 10 Canadians families that are bigger and tax free by stopping to send Conservative cheques to millionaires. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today is National Housing Day, but there is nothing to celebrate. EOS BOS One and a half million Canadian households have desperate needs in terms of housing, and 600,000 Canadians are in danger of losing their housing subsidy if the Conservatives do not renew the social housing agreement. EOS BOS Canada is the only country that does not have a national housing strategy. EOS BOS The Conservatives have a golden opportunity to discuss this with the provinces during the first ministers' meeting in Halifax. EOS BOS When will they stop ignoring social housing needs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the NDP, the Conservatives believe in action and that is exactly what we have done. EOS BOS That is why, under the economic action plan, we spent a lot of money on creating more than 16,000 projects to provide affordable housing to Canadians. EOS BOS We believe that every Canadian must have access to affordable and safe housing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, facts are facts and Canadians are going hungry. EOS BOS This fall, reports showed record food bank use and Campaign 2000 yesterday reported that one in seven children is still living in poverty. EOS BOS Both also point to affordable housing as key to solving the problem. EOS BOS Provincial, territorial and municipal governments are committed to providing affordable housing but the Conservatives are missing in action. EOS BOS The NDP has the solution. EOS BOS The only question is whether the Conservatives will support our national affordable housing strategy. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the NDP talks and we take action. EOS BOS Under the economic action plan, 27,000 new affordable housing units were created. EOS BOS We did that in spite of NDP opposition. EOS BOS We provide funding for over 600,000 affordable units across the country, despite the opposition of the NDP. EOS BOS We are working to ensure all Canadians have access to secure affordable housing, just as they deserve, in spite of the opposition of the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many constituents in my riding and across Canada worried about troubling U.S. tax laws that would punish Canadians. EOS BOS For many of these constituents, their only transgression was failing to file IRS paperwork they were unaware they were required to file. EOS BOS As such, our government called on the U.S. government to look upon these individuals with leniency. EOS BOS We were also clear that penalties imposed by the IRS under FBAR will not be collected by the Canada Revenue Agency on their behalf. EOS BOS Can the parliamentary secretary please update the House on this situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course our Conservative government understands that this has been a source of considerable anxiety. EOS BOS We have raised this issue repeatedly with the government of the United States. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance has been working closely with American officials on a common sense solution. EOS BOS We appreciate their engagement, especially that of the U.S. ambassador. EOS BOS We are happy to report that the U.S. has agreed to show leniency. EOS BOS It will waive penalties for many and allow potential refunds of penalties already paid. EOS BOS More details will follow in the coming weeks. EOS BOS This is a victory for Canadians and a testament to our positive working relationship with our American neighbours. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where that agreement came from with the banks. EOS BOS Is it some kind of nudge, nudge, wink, wink deal? EOS BOS We do not know. EOS BOS We have not seen it. EOS BOS We want a mandatory code. EOS BOS That is what the government agreed to yesterday. EOS BOS We want to see it happen. EOS BOS Now, onto another issue. EOS BOS The government has supported adoptions from many Muslim countries. EOS BOS Nusrat Munshi has been working for two years to bring her child home with no success. EOS BOS Other countries, like the United States and the United Kingdom, have figured this out and allowed legal recognition of guardianship for children from Muslim countries. EOS BOS Why has this government not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite would do well not to spread disinformation. EOS BOS Adoptions continue to happen in Canada in large numbers, including from many Muslim majority countries. EOS BOS However, those adoptions have to respect the national law of those countries, international conventions on adoption and the law of children, and Canadian law. EOS BOS When any of those requirements is not met, the adoption will not take place. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister would have us believe that there is nothing more he can do in this case, and that is shameful. EOS BOS The situation can and must be resolved. EOS BOS If the minister does not know how to do that, he can look at what is being done in the United States and the United Kingdom because they managed to solve this problem. EOS BOS In 2013, this government stopped recognizing adoptions of Pakistani children, which means that parents have been separated from their adoptive children for months or even years. EOS BOS Will the minister show some leadership in this matter, solve the problem and allow these parents to live in Canada with their adopted children? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have here two New Democrat MPs who, instead of looking after the interests of real people and real families with concerns by coming and talking to us about specific cases, would rather talk about these situations in the House. EOS BOS They know full well that we cannot comment on individual cases in the House. EOS BOS They are also quite familiar with the adoption rules. EOS BOS If they have cases they need help with, they should come and talk to us about them instead of turning other people's family lives into a partisan issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, our government and our High Commissioner in London, Gordon Campbell, announced an exciting plan to consolidate Canada's diplomatic presence in London by revitalizing and renovating historic Canada House in the heart of London, Trafalgar Square. EOS BOS At the same time, in order to finance this revitalization, we announced a plan to sell the Macdonald House at Grosvenor Square and move all of Canada's team in London to Canada House. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Foreign Affairs please update the House on this development? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very excited. EOS BOS We have been in Macdonald House for only 50 years. EOS BOS Canada House has been sitting vacant, by and large, since we left more than 50 years ago. EOS BOS We have an exciting plan to revitalize Canada House in Trafalgar Square to make it the face of Canada in one of the most exciting places in the world. EOS BOS Through the leadership of Gordon Campbell, our High Commissioner, we have obtained more than half a billion dollars for this property. EOS BOS We have bought another building right beside Canada House and we will be able to integrate the two, get the entire Canadian team working together. EOS BOS It is a good deal for taxpayers and a great face in Trafalgar Square for Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, many were shocked by the announced cuts to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, including severe cuts to bilateral commitments on the Great Lakes. EOS BOS Canadians will be further concerned to learn how the Liberal government also intends to make cuts to water protection. EOS BOS The minister likes to talk about her deep commitment to the Great Lakes, yet not only is her government continuing the substantial cuts put forward by the Harper regime but they are going even further. EOS BOS Will the Liberals restore funding to these vital initiatives or will they continue to be all talk and little action for our treasured waters? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was in Washington last week on Great Lakes Day where I made it perfectly clear to Americans, to my counterpart, that we need continued American investment in the Great Lakes, that we need to be working together because 40 million people rely on the Great Lakes for clean drinking water. EOS BOS It is an engine of the economy. EOS BOS We cannot have things like Asian carp come and destroy our Great Lakes and we are going to continue pushing with the United States to work to clean up our Great Lakes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister wants to limit his own speaking time. EOS BOS I would suggest he find something interesting to say, first. EOS BOS Let us remember that, just two years ago, the Prime Minister said that budgets balance themselves. EOS BOS In just a few hours, the government will table its second budget. EOS BOS After promising an initial deficit of $10 billion and ending up with a deficit of $30 billion and a return to a balanced budget in 2055, how will the Prime Minister go about ensuring that the budget will balance itself tomorrow? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS I say again that it was our government that committed to investing in the middle class and growing our economy. EOS BOS It was our government that introduced a tax cut for the middle class, while raising taxes for the wealthy. EOS BOS It must also be said that the official opposition party voted against the motion. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us not forget that 65% of Canadians were not affected by these so-called tax breaks, and that those who benefited the most from these so-called tax breaks are people who earn between $140,000 and $200,000. EOS BOS If that is what this government calls the middle class, I can understand why it is incapable of managing the country's finances properly and balancing the budget, and above all, why it is constantly punishing the middle class. EOS BOS Will there be any good news for the middle class in tomorrow's budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, budget 2017 will build on our commitment to support the middle class and foster economic prosperity. EOS BOS It was our government that introduced the Canada child benefit and finally lifted thousands of children out of poverty. EOS BOS It was also our government that increased the guaranteed income supplement by 10% to help low-income seniors. EOS BOS We have a good plan, and we will continue moving forward and supporting Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the report on the XL beef crisis made it clear that the largest beef recall in Canadian history was preventable. EOS BOS The report says the minister should read chapter 4 of the Weatherill report, called “How does Canada's food safety system work?”.Yet again, the minister has failed Canadian families. EOS BOS When will the minister stand up and take responsibility for his failures? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we welcome the panel report. EOS BOS We accept all of the recommendations. EOS BOS However, from that panel there are several quotes the member should read. EOS BOS One says, “ EOS BOS The Panel noted that, generally, both the food safety governance and management of this incident were sound.” Another one says, “ EOS BOS ...the incident revealed some of the strengths of Canada's food safety system—from monitoring and surveillance, to recall and incident management...”.And, finally, this one says, “CFIA's documentation of the incident was both thorough and EOS BOS well organized”.Canadians expect nothing less. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is the minister's failure. EOS BOS It is his responsibility. EOS BOS He should apologize. EOS BOS The issues raised in the report are the same as those identified in the report on the listeriosis crisis. EOS BOS Two crises, two reports and no action. EOS BOS His mismanagement is endangering people's lives, and that is to say nothing of the impact that the cuts in his department are having. EOS BOS What will it take for the minister to act? EOS BOS Another crisis? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as officials showed members of the agriculture committee this morning, there have been absolutely no cuts to anything to do with food safety from this government. EOS BOS We continue to vote, budget after budget, for hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure CFIA and Ag Canada have the capacity to continue to offer the best food safety system in the world. EOS BOS The opposition continues to vote against that. EOS BOS In the years we have been in government, we have added 20% to the personnel of CFIA to get that important job done. EOS BOS Again, they continue to vote against it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my riding of the Northwest Territories has significant infrastructure needs and faces particular challenges because of our northern climate. EOS BOS In April, experts from Canada and the United States gathered in Inuvik to discuss new techniques for infrastructure projects at the International Symposium of Permafrost Scientists. EOS BOS One of the projects they discussed was the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk highway that has just finished its third construction season. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities please update the House on the progress of this important project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, the hon. member for Northwest Territories for his tireless efforts on behalf of northern communities. EOS BOS Our government has made unprecedented commitments to support public infrastructure. EOS BOS The Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk highway will help to connect people, create jobs, and support economic development in the north. EOS BOS We are very encouraged by the progress of this project, and I look forward to touring this exciting project with my colleague in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today, grandmother Wendy Hoy arrived at Parliament after walking 800 kilometres from her home. EOS BOS She walked to raise awareness about the risks of unsafe levels of radiation. EOS BOS We are all surrounded today by devices, such as cellphone towers, WiFi and even smart meters. EOS BOS Studies have shown that excessive radiation poses health risks. EOS BOS When will the government finally take action on the health committee's 2010 recommendations to protect the safety of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously the health and safety of Canadians is a priority of this government. EOS BOS Canadians are well served by a strong independent regulator who is free from political interference and continues to regulate the nuclear industry in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when asked yesterday why the government is still spending half a million dollars fighting Cindy Blackstock and first nations children in court, the government repeated talking points about how it welcomed the ruling from the Human Rights Tribunal. EOS BOS I want to get the Minister of Justice on record on this issue. EOS BOS As the Attorney General of Canada, how can she justify not complying with this order of the tribunal, and what does she have to say to Cindy Blackstock, who is back at the tribunal today? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that no government has done more to repair the relationship with indigenous Canadians than this one, with $8.4 billion over the next five years in building infrastructure, supporting young people, and supporting indigenous communities. EOS BOS The fact is that we recognize there is much more to do, but we also have to recognize that it needs to be in concert with the indigenous communities themselves and with municipal and provincial partners, and that is exactly what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us put aside the rhetoric and talk about the facts. EOS BOS Since January, this government has received two compliance orders from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal and has spent nearly $500,000 on lawyers' fees to fight Cindy Blackstock after voting in the House to stop fighting indigenous children in court once and for all. EOS BOS How can the Minister of Justice justify this Conservative-style approach? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact is that we are working very hard to ensure that all Canadian children have the same opportunities to succeed. EOS BOS That means we have to make massive investments in indigenous communities and help youth from indigenous communities succeed. EOS BOS We still have much more work to do, but by investing $8.4 billion over the coming years, we have started doing the good work that was neglected for far too long by many governments here in the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are all over the place on international development. EOS BOS The minister has launched yet another review and another consultation to determine how Canada can refocus its international assistance. EOS BOS On one hand, the Liberals say they are reviewing the system, but at the same time, the minister keeps promising Canadian money at the international forums. EOS BOS Does this not make the Liberals' consultative process a big sham? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have participated in three international summits recently. EOS BOS One was on the status of women, another was on humanitarian aid, and the third was on health. EOS BOS My opposition colleague will not be surprised to learn that, as in past years, we pledged contributions to the Central Emergency Response Fund to ensure that Canada will always be among the first to respond to disasters. EOS BOS We also pledged to respond to major humanitarian organizations' annual appeals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a memo that was sent to Canadian Food Inspection Agency and XL Foods inspectors in 2008 asked them to ignore the quality of meat sold in Canada. EOS BOS Here is an excerpt:Ensure that non-Japan-eligible carcasses are not inspected... EOS BOS Ignore them. EOS BOS The result: processed beef for Canadian consumers was not inspected as closely as that destined for export. EOS BOS Why was this directive given? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in reality, the CFIA confirmed that the meat sold in Canada is just as safe as that exported to other markets, including Japan. EOS BOS In fact, that is the law in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the health of Canadians was not in jeopardy, why did the minister change this dangerous directive less than two weeks ago?Last spring, the minister presented his department's report on plans and priorities, which sets out approximately $46 million in cuts to the CFIA. EOS BOS He compromised the process for inspecting beef for Canadian consumption. EOS BOS How many inspections will not occur because of these cuts? EOS BOS What fecal contamination rate are the Conservatives willing to accept? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that safe food is a priority for the government and for CFIA, which enforces those regulations. EOS BOS We continue to build a robust food safety system in the country. EOS BOS We have added 20% to its budgets. EOS BOS We have added hundreds of front line food inspectors. EOS BOS We continue to do that, despite the NDP voting against those initiatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what does this minister actually do? EOS BOS It seems he is not responsible for anything. EOS BOS He failed in his responsibility and duty to ensure that food is safe. EOS BOS This memo, which comes from an agency that he oversees, proves that a two-tier food safety system was put in place under the Conservatives. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister apologize for giving priority to export markets to the detriment of Canadians' health? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, those allegations are absolutely unfounded and untrue. EOS BOS My role as minister is to ensure that CFIA has the capacity from a regulatory standpoint. EOS BOS We just voted through Bill S-11, the safe food for Canadians act, adding to its regulatory powers and ensuring that it has the budgetary capacity and manpower to enforce those regulations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the capacity the minister is talking about, clearly this memo was sent in 2008. EOS BOS We then saw 22 Canadians die of listeriosis and they resent the same memo. EOS BOS We then had the Weatherill report and they resent the memo. EOS BOS Was the minister really not aware front line food inspectors were being directed to ignore food safety procedures? EOS BOS Conservatives have lost all credibility on food safety, so will they now agree to an absolute audit of CFIA, as instructed in the Weatherill report, and do it now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, safe food for Canadians is a priority of the government and of CFIA, which enforces those regulations. EOS BOS The member opposite just sat through two hours of CFIA and myself giving pertinent information about these allegations, which are totally unfounded. EOS BOS CFIA has the budgetary capacity, thanks to our government and not thanks to the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what we heard for the last two hours was clearly that we had the largest beef meat recall in the county's entire history, courtesy of the minister and CFIA. EOS BOS Canadians are truly worried about the food they put on their plates. EOS BOS The minister should have resigned months ago, but if the Prime Minister is too stubborn to fire him, will he at least remove CFIA from his portfolio and give it to someone who can actually do the job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, CFIA continues to confirm that meat sold in Canada is just as safe as meat being exported to other markets, including Japan. EOS BOS That was reinforced this morning. EOS BOS CFIA also continues to ensure that all meat processed in Canada meets Canada's high food safety standards. EOS BOS That is enforceable by law. EOS BOS We will not apologize for doing our due diligence through CFIA to ensure that food is safe in the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the first memo that was sent out by CFIA in 2008 says as follows:When stationed at this position ensure that non Japan eligible carcasses are not inspected for spinal cord/dura-mater, OCD defects and minor ingesta (Ignore them).It goes on to say to ignore them. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister say that everything is perfectly okay when in fact the memo was changed? EOS BOS It was changed because there is a problem. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, CFIA has confirmed the meat sold in Canada is just as safe as meat exported to other countries. EOS BOS There are strict food safety standards in the country. EOS BOS That is the law and we ensure the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has the resources to enforce those standards. EOS BOS Indeed, we have, as rated internationally, one of the safest food systems in the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that the meat recall crisis, I would remind the Prime Minister, was the largest meat recall anywhere in the world ever with respect to what took place. EOS BOS I would like to ask the Prime Minister this. EOS BOS If in fact there was no problem with the original memo, why was the memorandum changed? EOS BOS I would remind him that the first memo says, “ EOS BOS Your first action should be to have the issue dealt with without a line stoppage”. EOS BOS Would the Prime Minister not agree with me that first action of any inspector is to ensure, above and beyond any line stoppage, that in fact the health and safety of Canadians is always the number one priority? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what the professionals at CFIA do. EOS BOS They ensure that the food that is put before Canadian consumers as well as international markets is safe. EOS BOS They continue to do that through due diligence. EOS BOS We, of course, would never apologize for the size and scope of a recall. EOS BOS CFIA does what needs to be done to ensure that Canadian food and export food is safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Does he not think that it is clearly time to look into what happened?A review must be done and it must be independent. EOS BOS Once again, considering the new memo that was released, there was definitely a problem. EOS BOS The memo was changed because there was a problem. EOS BOS This needs to be resolved through an independent review, which cannot be conducted by the government, but rather by an outside party that is completely independent of the government. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, coming out of the Weatherill report, there was an independent expert panel constructed. EOS BOS It will do an in-depth review— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has the floor. EOS </s> BOS It will complete an in-depth review, Mr. Speaker, and that report will be made public. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the CFIA memo said, and I quote, “ EOS BOS Our number 1 priority is to ensure this standard is met with Japan eligible carcasses”.We have a serious problem when food inspection depends on what country the meat is sold to. EOS BOS Why is the agency's priority not ensuring the health and safety of Canadians? EOS BOS Why is the meat sold to Canadians lower in quality than what is sold to Japan? EOS </s> BOS That is absolutely not true, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS CFIA and this government continue to build a robust food safety system. EOS BOS We are putting in place the moneys and the manpower, as well as the regulations that are required to ensure that domestic consumption, as well as export consumption, is safe food. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the minister has no idea what is going on in his department. EOS BOS He has lost control of his department and refuses to accept the consequences of the budget cuts. EOS BOS It is no surprise that Canadians have lost all confidence in him. EOS BOS How many recalls and lives at risk will it take for the Prime Minister to tell us whether he approves of how the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is handling this file? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are no cuts in our food safety system. EOS BOS If the NDP had its way, the hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of inspectors that we put in place since we formed government would never have happened. EOS BOS That is unfortunate. EOS BOS We have a food safety system that is rated superior by international adjudicators, by audits from other countries around the world. EOS BOS We continue to build a robust food safety system. EOS BOS We just passed Bill S-11, which will give the CFIA more regulatory powers in a recall situation. EOS BOS We look forward to that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, industry has said that investment in Alberta's oil sands will be down more than $60 billion over the past two years, a 63% decrease since 2014. EOS BOS Hundreds of thousands of Albertans have lost their jobs, and they are losing their homes. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has told Albertans that they should hang in there and they should be thankful that things are not worse. EOS BOS We cannot wait for things to get worse. EOS BOS When is the Liberal government finally going to make an investment in Canada's national energy program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have had the pleasure of representing Canada at a number of international meetings and to talk with those who are looking at investments in the energy sector. EOS BOS They all agree that Canada has been and will continue to be a very important international market for energy. EOS BOS It is our goal as the government to develop these energy sources, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which will make Canada, after these low commodity prices pass, again a major place of investment and confidence internationally. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite the Prime Minister's claims, the mayors of Canada's major cities are speaking with one voice, and their demands echo those of the provinces. EOS BOS We have a serious infrastructure deficit. EOS BOS The municipalities need the federal government to invest in infrastructure and affordable social housing. EOS BOS We need to catch up, and this will create more jobs. EOS BOS Why is the government incapable of working with other levels of government to stimulate job growth and infrastructure development? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has introduced the largest and the longest infrastructure plan in Canada's history, with $75 billion over the next 10 years. EOS BOS This includes the $53-billion new building Canada plan for municipal, provincial, and territorial infrastructure. EOS BOS We are making record investments and are keeping taxes low. EOS BOS The NDP, in addition to needing to mortgage its own party, it would appear, would also mortgage the future of our kids and our grandkids. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's big city mayors are calling for an urban agenda. EOS BOS They are looking for collaboration with the federal government to address crumbling infrastructure, a crisis in affordable housing, and funding for public transit, but the Conservatives govern as though cities do not exist, as if 80% of Canadians do not live in urban communities. EOS BOS Why are they leaving cities to fend for themselves? EOS BOS Why will they not support the infrastructure necessary to build more competitive and livable cities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government is making record investments in infrastructure. EOS BOS This includes public transit. EOS BOS In fact, public transit is an eligible category under every component of the new building Canada plan. EOS BOS What is more, we respect the jurisdiction of municipalities and provinces. EOS BOS They choose, they identify, their infrastructure project priorities. EOS BOS We look forward to continuing to work with our partners. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have met with people in forestry, and it is clear that the softwood lumber dispute will resume in a few weeks. EOS BOS The last time, the federal government was to blame for the loss of 15,000 jobs in Quebec in one year. EOS BOS That means a lot of people and families, and many villages and regions are emptying out. EOS BOS Among other things, our workers need loan guarantees to deal with the next dispute. EOS BOS Will Ottawa let our people down once again? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we recognize the importance of forestry in Canada. EOS BOS We have started a very good conversation with the provinces that may be affected by new measures. EOS BOS We will most assuredly take coordinated measures to protect jobs in this country. EOS BOS Canadians can count on us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent for the following motion. EOS BOS That this House, while recognizing the importance of debating matters of public interest, voice genuine outrage over the disparaging prejudices and stereotypes used in a column in Maclean's magazine published on March 20 to cast aspersions on the Quebec nation and that it condemn the rise of “Quebecophobia” in Canada. EOS </s> BOS Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: No. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister just said, “ EOS BOS That is our plan.” EOS BOS Two days ago, Global Television aired a clip of the Prime Minister making a statement that was completely irresponsible. EOS BOS He said he had no idea when Canada would return to a balanced budget. EOS BOS This is the first time in the history of Canada that a Prime Minister has uttered such nonsense. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance is a serious man who has a great deal of experience in the private sector. EOS BOS When the Minister of Finance worked in the private sector, would he have tolerated such an insipid remark from the Prime Minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, whether in the private or public sector, the figures are the same. EOS BOS The situation is clear. EOS BOS Our economic growth is much stronger than it was before. EOS BOS Our growth in the last three quarters has been in the order of 3.5%. EOS BOS We are in a very good situation, and employment levels are quite high for young people and Canadians across the country. EOS BOS Our plan for the economy is working very well for our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on the softwood lumber issue, Quebec reaffirmed last week that our forestry regime is fully compliant with NAFTA in every respect and that there was absolutely no reason for Ottawa to accept the imposition of any quotas or tariffs on our exports. EOS BOS However, in order to bail out British Columbia, the government is currently negotiating a protectionist agreement with the Americans, even though it could kill Quebec's forestry industry. EOS BOS Will the Minister of International Trade clearly tell the Americans that our lumber is not subsidized and that she will never agree to a protectionist agreement, unless Quebec is exempt from it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question. EOS BOS Our government recognizes the importance of forestry to Quebec and to Canada. EOS BOS In fact, I am meeting with representatives from the Quebec sector next Monday, in Montreal. EOS BOS I spoke with my U.S. counterpart, Michael Froman, about this specific issue two weeks ago at the APEC meeting. EOS BOS We are working hard to reach a deal that will be good for Canada and for Quebec. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are always in the business of telling us there are problems with Canadian institutions, so maybe they could tell us what the problem is with having representation from Atlantic Canada on the Supreme Court. EOS BOS If this has been an issue for the Liberals for the last 141 years, maybe they could tell us where in their election platform they said they were not going to guarantee representation for Atlantic Canada on the Supreme Court. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Niagara Falls for his interest in Atlantic Canada. EOS BOS What we committed to during the election was to fix a broken Supreme Court of Canada nomination process that was in effect under the previous government. EOS BOS That process was opaque, secretive, out of date, and in need of an overhaul. EOS BOS That is why we have put in place a process that is transparent, accountable, and open. EOS BOS It involves parliamentarians, and it does not involve attacks by the Prime Minister on the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. EOS BOS That is real change. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be born in Niagara Falls, but I am proud to have 150 years of my family from Cape Breton Island EOS BOS . I will take no lessons from the member. EOS BOS If the Liberals do not want to do the right thing because the Conservatives are telling them what to do, why do they not listen to four Liberal senators from Nova Scotia? EOS BOS They want the Liberals to do the right thing. EOS BOS Or is that the reason, probably, they got kicked out of the Liberal caucus? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think I can do one better. EOS BOS I married a Cape Bretoner. EOS BOS The process that was in place under the previous government was opaque, outdated, and in need of an overhaul. EOS BOS The four senators absolutely deserve credit for their advocacy on this issue. EOS BOS Those four senators were advocates for Nova Scotia even before the last election. EOS BOS I am pleased to say that the advisory board tasked with coming up with jurists of the highest calibre has included names from Atlantic Canada on its list. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since the Prime Minister unveiled his Supreme Court appointment process to shut out Atlantic Canada, the silence from the 32 Liberal MPs from Atlantic Canada has been deafening. EOS BOS Now, four senators from Atlantic Canada are calling on the Prime Minister to respect Atlantic representation. EOS BOS Given that these senators are finally speaking up, will the Prime Minister get around to doing the right thing and appoint an Atlantic Canadian? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated, we inherited a process that was badly broken, that was secretive, and that did not involve parliamentarians. We have reformed that process. EOS BOS It is now open, transparent, and accountable. EOS BOS That process has resulted in a list going forward to the Prime Minister of highly qualified, functionally bilingual jurists, including candidates from Atlantic Canada. EOS BOS We are perfectly capable of participating in a national competition. EOS BOS We have been doing it for more than 141 years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the question was about Standing Rock and the aggression that people are seeing, including Canadian citizens. EOS BOS Let us talk about inequality, which is growing in our country. EOS BOS More and more Canadians are facing precarious work, as was shown in the CIBC report. EOS BOS We know that more and more young Canadians are stuck in low-wage work, and an alarming 61% of Canadians are earning less than the average yearly income. EOS BOS The response of the Prime Minister and the finance minister: too bad, get used to it, with platitudes about the middle class—while that dream slips away from more and more people. EOS BOS Why is the government catering to its billionaire and Bay Street friends instead of standing up for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this gives me the opportunity to talk about the good work this government is doing to address the serious challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0 that is facing every single country in the world. EOS BOS It is our goal to ensure that young people have a chance to be successful. EOS BOS This is exactly why we appointed the expert panel on youth employment, and we are looking forward to its interim report at the beginning of December. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week we learned about the lavish lifestyle led by the president of Tourism Montreal and a former Liberal minister, Charles Lapointe. EOS BOS Limousines, an outrageous severance package and inflated salaries: nothing was too good for Mr. Lapointe. EOS BOS Ottawa provides funding to Tourism Montreal every year. EOS BOS Will the federal government hold Tourism Montreal accountable for this mismanagement by a notable Liberal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we support this organization's marketing efforts abroad in order to attract international tourists to Canada, as we do for many other organizations. EOS BOS However, we do not finance the organization's operating costs or salaries. EOS BOS Economic development is a top priority here on this side of the House. EOS BOS We take the management of public funds very seriously, and we will be watching this issue closely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, $2 million in federal subsidies go to Tourism Montreal. EOS BOS This matter must be taken seriously. EOS BOS Mismanagement problems are increasing in organizations under federal responsibility. EOS BOS Today it is Tourism Montreal, but a few months ago, it was the Old Port. EOS BOS Instead of simply reacting after each problem occurs, what measures will the Conservatives bring in to prevent such problems? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we support this organization's marketing efforts abroad to attract tourists to Canada. EOS BOS However, we do not finance the organization's operating costs or salaries, and we will be watching this issue closely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a former Conservative environment minister, the member for Thornhill, is complaining that his government is not getting enough credit for its efforts combatting climate change. EOS BOS Come on. EOS BOS In his opinion, it is difficult to cut greenhouse gas emissions in Canada because hydroelectric power is already a clean form of energy. EOS BOS As if we did not already know that. EOS BOS The real problem is that the Conservatives and the Liberals have never forced the oil and gas sectors to do their part. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives announce the regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions for the industry that is the largest polluter in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada only accounts for less than 2% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS For this reason, Canada is pursuing a new international agreement on climate change that includes real action by all major emitters. EOS BOS In the meantime, our government is also doing its part by taking action domestically to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS Since 2006, we have invested significant funds in more efficient technology, better infrastructure, adaptation, and clean energy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives think that the best way to fight climate change is to advertise in the United States to promote the Keystone XL pipeline. EOS BOS With the measures announced on Monday, the Americans will reach their Copenhagen reduction target of 17%. EOS BOS With the Conservatives' approach, Canada will not even get halfway to its 2020 goal. EOS BOS If the oil and gas sectors do not make an effort, we will not reach our goal. EOS BOS When will we find out what their target is? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we welcome the move from the United States, and I say it is about time. EOS BOS In Canada, 10% of electricity generation comes from coal; in the United States, it is 37%. EOS BOS More than 60% of electricity generation is renewable in Canada. EOS BOS In the United States, it is just 12%. EOS BOS The statistics speak for themselves. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives have gotten ignoring everyone who disagrees with them down to a fine art, because they are not listening to Canadians who want action on climate change and they are turning a deaf ear on our U.S. neighbours, who are taking action on their biggest greenhouse gas emitters. EOS BOS Instead of regulating emissions from Canada's biggest emitters, the oil and gas sector, the government gives them billions in subsidies. EOS BOS The numbers do not lie, so will Conservatives stop ignoring science, stop ignoring Canadians, and finally introduce rigorous greenhouse gas regulations for the oil and gas sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, building on our record, we will continue to work with the United States on reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS Our countries should be taking action together, not alone. EOS BOS This is why we welcomed the move from the United States two days ago on greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS Again, this is consistent with what we are already doing by aligning with the United States on greenhouse gas emission regulations. EOS BOS In the transportation sector, for example, 2025 passenger vehicles and light trucks will emit about half as much greenhouse gas in Canada as the 2008 models. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives ignore concerns about climate change just like they ignore concerns from British Columbians about our environment. EOS BOS A new poll shows that two out of every three people in British Columbia are opposed to the northern gateway project. EOS BOS These numbers are even higher than in the January poll. EOS BOS The more people learn about this project, the more they oppose it. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives really going to flout the wishes of 67% of British Columbians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government will thoroughly review the joint panel report and continue to consult with aboriginal communities prior to making any decision on this project. EOS BOS We are proud of the action that we have taken to ensure Canada has a world-class regulatory framework and a means to the safest forms of transportation for our energy products. EOS BOS We have been clear: projects will only proceed if they are safe for Canadians and safe for the environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been consulting with British Columbians, and this is what they are telling the government. EOS BOS On this side, we have the Union of B.C. Municipalities rejecting the Enbridge northern gateway; on that side, we have the oil lobby. EOS BOS On this side, we have virtually every single first nation across Alberta and British Columbia standing together opposing this pipeline; on that side, they have the oil lobby. EOS BOS On this side, we have nearly two-thirds of all British Columbians rejecting the Conservative approach to oil and gas; on that side, we have the oil lobby. EOS BOS When are Conservatives going to stand with British Columbians and say no to the Enbridge northern gateway project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the NDP would prefer to reject science and facts and decide which projects should go ahead based on ideology. While the Leader of the Opposition laughs, that is his record, actually. EOS BOS The Leader of the Opposition said, “ EOS BOS There are some things that some people would send to the NEB that we would say no to”. EOS BOS That is great. EOS BOS It is an independent organization for the benefit of Canadians and energy products. EOS BOS Canadians deserve better than that. EOS BOS Our government will make decisions based on the independent scientific review performed by the NEB. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives do not take anything seriously, not even the Elections Canada investigation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister's election return. EOS BOS Yesterday, my colleague from Nepean— EOS BOS Carleton kept handing us the same insipid line about how all of the documents were turned over and how everything else was made up. EOS BOS Yesterday evening, we learned that the individual in question, the member for Peterborough, was still turning over new information. EOS BOS It seems that not everything has been revealed after all. EOS BOS We are simply asking the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister to do the right thing while this matter is under investigation. EOS BOS When will he step down? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the member keeps asking the same questions, she will keep getting the same answers. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member turned all of the documents over to Elections Canada nearly four years ago. EOS BOS He has won another election since then. EOS BOS Elections Canada has not asked him for any more information. EOS BOS The New Democrats should be more open and transparent about telling Canadians how much union money they have accepted illegally and how much of that money they have paid back. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I love the political musings of the hon. member for Nepean—Carleton. EOS BOS I really do. EOS BOS I think he would make a great Republican blogger. EOS BOS Unfortunately, he makes a pretty lousy defence attorney, because he needs to get his story straight with his client. EOS BOS Yesterday and today he said that all of the documents have been provided. EOS BOS Yesterday the hon. EOS BOS member for Peterborough came forward and said that the $21,000 bill from Holinshed was not a real bill, just an invoice. EOS BOS We are dealing with serious allegations. EOS BOS Will the hon. EOS BOS member stand up, fire his defence attorney and tell this House that he has been compromised? EOS BOS He needs to step down until this investigation is complete. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, not only has the hon. EOS BOS member given all the information required of a filing over to Elections Canada, not only have those filings been audited and verified by Elections Canada, not only has another election passed since that time, but he has also not even been contacted by Elections Canada in search of additional information. EOS BOS By contrast, he has taken the stance that the NDP should come clean on the illegal union donations for which it was caught and for which it had to plead guilty. EOS BOS Now all that we ask is for the leader of the NDP to rise, explain how much illegal money his party took, and how much it gave back. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in all fairness, I have to keep Band-Aids on my ankles from the partisan ankle-biter trying to change the channel. EOS BOS What we have here—Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I do not think referring to each other in that manner is helpful to the debate. EOS BOS I will ask the member to get to his question without using that type of characteristic. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday you thought it was okay, but I will accept your judgment on this. EOS BOS What we are dealing with is a $21,000 bill that the Conservatives claim is a non-bill. EOS BOS Around this bill, we have personal cheques, cancelled cheques and refunded cheques. EOS BOS We have an investigation, lawsuits and court files. EOS BOS These are serious issues. EOS BOS I ask the member for Peterborough to do the right thing and stand up and say that he will step down while this investigation is under way. EOS BOS That is what he needs to do. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all I ask is for that hon. member to stop gnawing on his own ankles and join with me in an effort to raise the level of discourse around here. EOS BOS We on this side of the House are focused on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity, no matter how hard the opposition members try to distract from that economic agenda. EOS BOS Tonight, they have a chance to join with us and do what Canadians actually care about, and that is to keep taxes and debt low, to keep the economy strong and to build on the 750,000 net new jobs we have already created. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives said that they agreed with the motions, and the motions were moved. EOS BOS Meetings were held in camera and, just like that, the motions no longer existed. EOS BOS The budget implementation bill— EOS </s> BOS There is no interpretation at the moment. EOS BOS Is it fixed? EOS BOS It is working now. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Alfred-Pellan. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives said that they agreed with the motions, and the motions were moved. EOS BOS Meetings were held in camera and, just like that, the motions no longer existed. EOS BOS The budget implementation bill, which is supposed to deal exclusively with the economy, also attacks the Customs Act. EOS BOS Therefore, it is imperative that the chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security provide for study of Bill C-45. EOS BOS A motion will soon be debated in that regard. EOS BOS Can the chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security assure us that Bill C-45 will be on the committee's agenda? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is asking several committees to scrutinize the legislation, but I always find it interesting when the NDP members say, “Do as we say, not as we do”. EOS BOS They complain that this bill is too big, but when the NDP does budget bills in Manitoba, they are omnibus bills. EOS BOS When the Leader of the Opposition was a member of the government in Quebec, it had a budget implementation bill 468 sections long, 383 pages. EOS BOS The Leader of the Opposition says, “Do as I say, not as I do”. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the crisis in journalism continues, 30 newspapers are shutting down, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage is not worried about it. EOS BOS Some Liberal members are, however, La Presse reporting today that it is obvious that not everyone is on board and that some Liberal members are privately voicing their dissatisfaction with the government's inaction. EOS BOS They “have trouble understanding the government's laissez-faire attitude to web giants”. EOS BOS The member for Ottawa West— EOS BOS Nepean said that if any solutions exist, we should pursue them. EOS BOS The member for Vancouver Centre said that the minister had said that she would help press journalism but that that is not what people are asking for. EOS BOS How many lost jobs will it take for the minister to lift a finger? EOS BOS How many members from her own caucus will it take for her to consider this issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have always been clear on the subject: we value the importance of journalism and every year we help the print media by providing up to $75 million through the Canada periodical fund. EOS BOS As part of our new vision for a creative Canada, we said that we will continue to support local media and we are also going to help local media that are not yet online, meaning those still available in print form, to transition to the digital world since that is how more and more people are accessing the news. EOS BOS We want to make sure that Canadians have access to journalistic information. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in a recent survey conducted by Thomas Reuters Foundation involving 63 global experts from five continents, Canada was ranked as the best place to be a woman among the G20 nations. EOS BOS This was based on key indicators of health, education, justice, access to resources and freedom from violence, trafficking and slavery. EOS BOS Could the Minister for Status of Women tell this House what the government is doing to make Canada an even better place for women and girls? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for all the great work she is doing on behalf of women across Canada. EOS BOS These 63 global experts from five continents recognize that our efforts to promote gender equality, to safeguard women and girls against violence and exploitation, and to ensure their access to health care are what make Canada a great country for women. EOS BOS Women in Canada can count on our government to continue our efforts in that respect. EOS BOS We have increased funding for women to its highest level ever, funding over 500 projects now to end violence against women across Canada. EOS BOS We will continue to fight for women's economic opportunities, their safety, their political participation and equality. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, people just do not trust the current government to protect their privacy. EOS BOS We can see that from how quickly Canadians mobilized against the Conservatives' online snooping bill, yet new documents now show that public agencies such as the CBSA are already getting warrantless access to individual customer data from cellphone companies. EOS BOS We now know this regularly includes information about personal identity and addresses. EOS BOS Would the government tell us how many of its departments are being asked to spy on law-abiding Canadians without obtaining a warrant? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to privacy, Canada has some of the toughest legislation of any country in the world. EOS BOS On the point that the hon. EOS BOS member raised, I would like to reassure him. EOS BOS This is a common practice, and one that is within the law. EOS BOS In these matters, we expect all agencies to obey the law, and that is exactly the case in the example given by the member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after the personal information of 500,000 students was leaked, no one trusts the Conservatives to protect their privacy any more. EOS BOS In the 2012 fiscal year, the Canada Border Services Agency submitted nearly 19,000 requests for the personal information of telecommunications subscribers, and in most cases it obtained that information, without a warrant and without informing the subscribers in 99% of those cases. EOS BOS Why is the minister allowing this violation of the privacy of honest, law-abiding citizens? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I just answered that question, but I would like to repeat that Canada has some of the toughest privacy legislation in the world. EOS BOS Our government takes this matter very seriously on behalf of honest Canadians. EOS BOS As I said, the Canada Border Services Agency complies with current Canadian legislation, in regard to the issue raised and all requests for information. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to raise an issue that I think is very important. EOS BOS This follows on the point I raised in June 2012, which, as we know, was settled amicably. EOS BOS I will give an example that demonstrates how difficult it is to get information from Public Works and Government Services Canada. EOS BOS After that, I will talk about a pertinent question addressed today. EOS BOS In early January 2011, some members of the Vanier business improvement area called me looking for information on the grants in lieu of taxes program. EOS BOS As everyone knows, the Crown does not pay property taxes, but the government legislated to ensure the payment of grants in lieu of taxes to the municipalities in which government buildings are located. EOS BOS The BIA wanted more information—and not any privileged information—about how the program works. EOS BOS I called the public official responsible for that program at PWGSC. EOS BOS I left a message indicating that I would like to speak with him. EOS BOS About 15 minutes later, my office received a call from the office of the Minister of Public Works informing us that if we wanted any information, we had to go through the minister's office. EOS BOS Since we needed information, I asked for a briefing session, which took place two weeks later. EOS BOS Two weeks later, in an office on Parliament Hill, I met with three public servants—the person I spoke with on the phone and two of his associates—along with three people from the Vanier BIA and two of the minister's staff members. EOS BOS We exchanged information. EOS BOS It was completely neutral information that was not privileged. EOS BOS It was public information on how this program works since the people from the BIA were having difficulty. EOS BOS However, that is not the issue here. EOS BOS Here is what happened at the end of the meeting. EOS BOS The senior public servant gave his business card to the Vanier BIA director and told her that, if she needed any more information, she could call or email him directly. EOS BOS So I said to him, “ EOS BOS Are you saying that she can call you and you will give her the information without any problem, when I cannot get that same information without going through the minister's office?” EOS BOS He said that, according to the instructions he had been given, I indeed had to go through the minister's office. EOS BOS I thought it was a bit much that an MP could not get information while others could get it directly. EOS BOS However, since the BIA got the information it needed, I did not make a big deal out of it. EOS BOS Perhaps I should have, and my failure to do so may have been a mistake. EOS BOS This creates two problems. EOS BOS First, it creates unnecessary work and makes communication completely inefficient. EOS BOS Second, it calls into question the professionalism of our public servants. EOS BOS That is terrible because, if an MP requests privileged information, I would expect that public servants would not provide it. EOS BOS However, if an MP asks for public information, he should normally be able to get it, particularly if his constituents have access to it. EOS BOS That is the situation. EOS BOS That is the case that we are currently dealing with. EOS BOS The second important issue in the riding that I have the honour of representing is the development of the Rockcliffe military base. EOS BOS (1510)[English] The Canada Lands Company has hired a gentleman called Don Schultz. EOS BOS He is a consultant, and over the last few months he has met with just about anybody who has any interest in this file. EOS BOS All community associations have been met with. EOS BOS The local city councillor has been met with, twice. EOS BOS He has met my neighbours. EOS BOS He has met everybody. EOS BOS I am not criticizing Mr. Schultz; I need that to be very clear. EOS BOS All I have heard about him is very good and positive. EOS BOS He is attentive. EOS BOS He follows up. EOS BOS He is doing a very good job of listening and getting us in. EOS BOS Since this is a most important file in the riding that I have the honour of representing, I called on December 3, after he had been at this for a few months, to get a sense of how things were going. EOS BOS The answer was that he could not meet with me unless he had authorization from the office of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services. EOS BOS This is getting interesting. EOS BOS I think this brings up the same kind of problems I just mentioned. EOS BOS Why should I have to go through the minister's office, when he is meeting everybody without any authorization from the minister's office? EOS BOS For the elected representative of the people, he therefore has to get permission. EOS BOS Today, from the office of the minister, I got notice that a briefing would not be possible, but perhaps a conference call could be arranged. EOS BOS This is the question of privilege that I need to raise. EOS BOS As elected officials, information is our lifeblood. EOS BOS If we cannot get access to information that everybody else seems to be able to get without any hurdles, there is a problem. EOS BOS There is an insidiousness here that is frightening. EOS BOS I have had a number of conversations with colleagues from the government side, and never has any one of them ever told me they have had a problem with accessing information concerning problems in the riding they represent. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like you to look into this matter. EOS BOS I believe this is a situation which is significantly problematic. EOS BOS If the government has instructed public servants (a), not to speak to us, therefore not trusting their professionalism, (b), to slow things down purposefully through the minister's office so we cannot get information, what does that say? EOS BOS Does it say that the government is trying purposefully to put us in a situation where we will not able to defend the interests of the constituents we were elected to represent?I think my colleagues know that I try to work positively. EOS BOS I try to work constructively. EOS BOS I have done that for a number of years now. EOS BOS However, this is problematic. EOS BOS I know that colleagues on this side and in the NDP have had the same problem. EOS BOS Mr. EOS BOS Speaker, I believe you have a responsibility as our speaker to protect us and our privilege of having a level playing field of access to information for the benefit of the constituents we have been elected to represent. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was listening closely. EOS BOS I do not know a lot about the circumstances, but I expect the government will want to come back with further submissions. EOS BOS I will observe that I did not hear any aspect of the duties or responsibilities of a member of Parliament that were in any way blocked so that his abilities to perform them were impaired in any particular way, which I think is fundamental to raising a point of privilege like this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we also would like to enter this debate at some point, having not yet heard the details of the case other than what my colleague has expressed so far. EOS BOS However, many of my colleagues have faced a number of obstructions from civil servants who have previously been quite open to allowing members access to information that the public has, things being referred to the Prime Minister's Office, through the PCO, in a way that makes it impossible to find out things that are sometimes, as we have found out later, available online. EOS BOS There is this control element that seems to be happening in the government that specifically targets members of the opposition and therefore infringes upon our privileges as MPs to do the work on behalf of our constituents. EOS BOS Much of that work is based on information that only the government has. EOS BOS These are not state secrets. EOS BOS These are things that are generally and broadly available. EOS BOS The government seems to have some sort of strategy in which all things have to be referred to the central command, preventing us from doing work we were elected to do. EOS BOS We will reserve the right to come back to this once we review the details. EOS BOS I look forward to the Speaker's ruling. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. members for their interventions and look forward to future submissions on this question. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, yesterday the parliamentary budget officer confirmed our worst fears. EOS BOS Compared with under the Conservative watch, the Liberals have increased spending by more than $3 billion, and that was just in the first three months of this year. EOS BOS Yet, there is nothing to show for this reckless spending. EOS BOS Jobs are being lost across the country. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop their out-of-control spending and start respecting hard-working taxpayers? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, this is the government that has decided to invest in Canadians and the Canadian economy. EOS BOS What we are doing has been applauded around the world. EOS BOS Let me quote what the managing director of the IMF, Madame Christine Lagarde, said recently. EOS BOS She said, really, very much of the Canadian economic policies “can actually go viral”.What we are doing is right for Canadians and is applauded around the world. EOS BOS We will continue to do that. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the ordinary Canadian is struggling. EOS BOS The economy has lost over 60,000 jobs just over the summer. EOS BOS Investment is leaving Canada. EOS BOS Household debt is at record levels. EOS BOS Yet, the Liberal government continues to spend recklessly and increase taxes. EOS BOS Expert after expert confirms that the Liberals' spending spree is not working and is not helping the economy. EOS BOS When will the Liberals do the right thing, cancel their tax hikes on Canadian families, and control their reckless spending? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, actually, growth was up in July. EOS BOS Let us be clear on the facts. EOS BOS More importantly, this government has, as its first priority, reduced taxes for Canadians, because that is what Canadian families wanted. EOS BOS After that, we went on to introduce the Canada child benefit, which is helping nine families out of ten. EOS BOS Then we went on to enhance the CPP, the Canadian pension plan. EOS BOS Then we went on to make historical investments in infrastructure and innovation. EOS BOS That is the way to grow an economy, and we will continue to do just that. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Canadian businesses are losing confidence in the Liberal government. EOS BOS Less than 48 hours after the Pacific NorthWest project was approved, Petronas is rumoured to be selling its stake. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because the cost and uncertainty of doing business in Canada is too high. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop raising taxes and stop choking businesses with needless red tape and delays? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, let me state for the record very clearly, the very first thing that this government did was to reduce taxes for nine million Canadians. EOS BOS That is the first thing we did, and we are very proud of it. EOS BOS What we are doing is applauded around the world, by the IMF managing director, by the governor of the Bank of Canada, by the PBO.What we are doing is the right thing for Canadians, and we will continue to do just that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, just this week, the House adopted an important code of conduct for members recognizing the seriousness and unacceptability of sexual harassment in our workplace. EOS BOS Yesterday the Speaker of the Senate confirmed that Senator Meredith is now under investigation for workplace sexual harassment and bullying. EOS BOS Harassment of any form should not be tolerated in Parliament. EOS BOS Does the government agree that everyone working for the House and the Senate is entitled to a workplace free of harassment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, any allegations of harassment against women in the workplace must be taken very seriously. EOS BOS Our government has been focused on taking significant actions to ensure that Canadians are protected. EOS BOS Many of those, the opposition have voted against. EOS BOS Whether it be those to ensure women are protected or to ensure women are empowered, the opposition parties continually vote against them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of the Environment said for the umpteenth time in seven years that greenhouse gas emissions regulations for the oil sector will be announced soon. EOS BOS The Conservatives made the same promise in 2011. EOS BOS Therefore, it is not surprising that Canadians and our largest trading partner, the United States, have doubts about whether the Conservative government really intends to fight climate change. EOS BOS When exactly will the regulations go into effect? EOS BOS How much will it cost businesses to comply? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this has already been put on the table. EOS BOS We have already implemented reforms to protect our environment and the climate. EOS BOS Our government has policies to combat this global problem. EOS BOS However, we are against the NDP's proposal to create a new $21 billion carbon tax. EOS BOS It is right there in black and white in the NDP platform. EOS BOS We are against it. EOS BOS Our reforms and policies have already met with success. EOS BOS Just today, we announced new programs to combat greenhouse gas emissions across Canada that will build on our success. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's inaction with regard to the Kathryn Spirit is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS This ship has been rusting in Beauharnois for over three years while the Conservatives twiddle their thumbs. EOS BOS What makes the situation even more complex is that Transport Canada refuses to tell us whether this leaky old boat still contains chemicals that could pollute the banks of Lac Saint-Louis and contaminate the drinking water reservoir of the entire greater Montreal area. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Transport wake up and do something so that this ship does not spend a fourth winter rusting in Beauharnois? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of Canadians is a top priority for this government. EOS BOS The member should know that vessel owners must comply with stringent safety and environmental obligations before proceeding with towing operations. EOS BOS The Kathryn Spirit is under a departure prohibition from Transport Canada and will remain in place until a final inspection confirms that the regulations in fact are complied with. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Gerard Comeau, with the help of the Canadian Constitution Foundation, won his court case, which would allow Canadians to bring beer across provincial lines into New Brunswick. EOS BOS Many constitutional scholars say this will inevitably end up at the Supreme Court. EOS BOS Authorities say that the liquor laws are still in force despite this ruling. EOS BOS Consumers deserve certainty, and the sooner the better. EOS BOS Does the government intend to refer this case to the Supreme Court? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that was a very positive development that we saw with regard to alcohol and the transferring of alcohol from one jurisdiction to another. EOS BOS That is why I am working very closely with my provincial and territorial counterparts on an agreement on internal trade, a comprehensive agreement that would reduce barriers and eliminate barriers altogether and that would work on issues around regulatory compliance. EOS BOS The idea here is to ensure we grow and create opportunities for businesses and people to succeed in Canada. EOS BOS That is why we are going to continue to pursue an agreement on internal trade that would address that issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives are simply failing Atlantic Canadians. EOS BOS Now they are undermining our livelihood with their attack on fisheries protection. EOS BOS Former fisheries ministers, including two Conservatives, are condemning the government's proposals. EOS BOS How do the Conservatives respond? EOS BOS They accuse former minister Siddon of not reading the bill. EOS BOS Wrong again. EOS BOS He not only read the bill, he renamed some of these reckless clauses. EOS BOS Clause 147 is the “ EOS BOS let them off lightly” clause. EOS BOS Clause 150 is the “minister cops out” clause. EOS BOS Why is the government ramming through changes that will harm our fisheries and hurt our coastal communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, we are providing a much-needed greater focus on fisheries, particularly on recreational, commercial and aboriginal fisheries, so that we can ensure that those resources are available for future generations. EOS BOS Frankly, I am a bit surprised that the member thinks this is a novel concept. EOS BOS In 1998, under a Liberal minister, there was a new policy document that explained how to apply the habitat section of the act. EOS BOS It says: Section 35 is not about the protection of fish habitat for the benefit of fish, but of fisheries. EOS BOS Therefore, the decision required is a determination of whether or not the potentially affected fish habitat directly or indirectly supports - or has the potential to support - a commercial, recreational or subsistence fishery. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the only thing the Conservatives want to protect is the bottom line of their industry friends. EOS BOS This reckless dismantling of fisheries protection will harm our fishing communities and the economies that sustain them. EOS BOS Fishery groups are already warning that the Conservatives' cuts to DFO science would put the fisheries at risk. EOS BOS Scrapping in-house research for a hand-picked talk shop will not serve Canadians who rely on fisheries science to protect their livelihood. EOS BOS How does the minister expect to respond to crises that could cripple vital fisheries without this science? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we certainly agree that science is very important to the protection of our fisheries. EOS BOS That is why we invest about $230 million every year in science EOS BOS . We will continue to invest in the priorities so that we can protect these fisheries that Canadians depend on. EOS BOS We are committed to that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are ready to roll the dice to determine the fate of coastal communities. EOS BOS The minister will not even say whether he has consulted anyone on separating the fleet and he is keeping mum on his plans. EOS BOS Local fishers are worried and rightly so. EOS BOS They see a minister who is abandoning his responsibilities with respect to scientific research, fisheries and fish habitat. EOS BOS The coastal communities are entitled to answers. EOS BOS Is separating the fleet part of the minister's plans or not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague is suffering from the heartbreak of premature exaggeration. EOS BOS We have said a number of times in this House that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans had a conversation with fisheries stakeholders about changes they would propose in order to make the fisheries more prosperous and sustainable for the future. EOS BOS The minister and his officials are continuing to look at that feedback and will make some decisions in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a batch of weak responses and inappropriate jokes when 1,000 people are being cut from the staff of Department of Fisheries and Oceans. EOS BOS It is unworthy to assault knowledgeable and dedicated former ministers for voicing their real concerns about the plan to weaken habitat protection for fish. EOS BOS The government's strategy is to attack anyone who disagrees with it. EOS BOS The four former fisheries ministers from B.C. are just the latest targets. EOS BOS West coast salmon are far too important to British Columbians to be lost because of the government's petty ideology and gross mismanagement. EOS BOS Why condemn the Pacific fisheries to the fate of the Atlantic cod? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we did not have much of a conversation with former minister Siddon about Atlantic cod. EOS BOS I suppose we could have. EOS BOS Let me remind the member that salmon are part of aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries. EOS BOS We are going to be protecting those with excellence to ensure that they are available for future generations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, many Canadian companies are transitioning to the new banking system, but the Conservatives are having a hard time keeping pace. EOS BOS Banks and telecommunications companies have agreed to new rules for telephone payment. EOS BOS The government's voluntary code of conduct does not address payment by phone or through electronic banking systems. EOS BOS If the Conservatives do not take action, consumers will not be protected. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives introduce mandatory rules for new technologies in order to protect consumers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, the private sector telecommunications companies and the banks are innovating, which is a good thing. EOS BOS It is something that we in the Conservative Party actually encourage in our country, unlike the NDP, which would like the government to run everything. EOS BOS That is not what we are doing. EOS BOS Now we are responsible for regulation of the banking system, and I am proud to say we have the best-regulated banking system in the world. EOS
BOS That fact is, Mr. Speaker, mobile payments will have a huge impact on consumers, small businesses and the digital economy, something the Conservatives do not seem to get. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance's own task force on mobile payments released recommendations months ago, but he has simply allowed it to gather dust. EOS BOS A voluntary code that lets $5 billion in hidden merchant fees slide will not protect small businesses and consumers from being gouged even more in the new mobile market. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives now admit that a binding code of conduct is necessary? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are two points about a code of conduct. EOS BOS One is not whether it is voluntary or not; it is that it is obeyed. EOS BOS The code of conduct that we have devised, and this is the second point, with the support of consumers, with the support of the financial sector, on consent at the end of the day, has the support of all the parties and is obeyed, is complied with, precisely because of the process that we used. EOS BOS With respect to payments, we have the report of the task force. EOS BOS I am glad the private sector is innovating, but at the end of the day the government makes the rules. EOS
BOS The result, Mr. Speaker, is that 300,000 more Canadians are looking for work. EOS BOS Canadians deserve better than that. EOS BOS The government has been repeatedly warned that failing to protect the environment will have economic costs. EOS BOS Now it is being challenged by our closest ally to take action on climate change. EOS BOS How many jobs will Canadians miss out on while Conservatives get their act together? EOS BOS How many countries will shut their doors to our resources because of the government's irresponsible policies? EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop stalling, defend the Canadian interest and take real, effective action on climate change? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course we have taken action on climate change, and as a matter of fact, we are already halfway toward our goal to reduce emissions by 17% for 2020. EOS BOS The action is before us. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, the Commissioner of the Environment made very clear testimony about the fact that he has confidence in our government's approach. EOS BOS What Canadians do not have confidence in, of course, though, is the NDP way, and we know what the NDP way is, which is to tax and to regulate into the ground industries and whole economies of this country. EOS BOS We know that the leader of the NDP thinks that Alberta's energy sector is a disease in the country. EOS BOS We know that the NDP supports a carbon tax EOS BOS . We will continue to fight them and stand up for the environment at the same time. EOS
BOS The NDP way is to get the job done, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS What the Conservatives have done against the environment, they are doing against manufacturing. EOS BOS This government has been the worst government in our nation's history for loss of manufacturing jobs. EOS BOS They have lost 500,000 family-sustaining jobs on their watch. EOS BOS The latest figures are even worse: a 3.1% further decline in manufacturing sales. EOS BOS That is the largest decline since May 2009.Will they start fixing what they have broken? EOS BOS Will they change their policies in the next budget to get back the manufacturing jobs they have lost? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what we will do in our budget is what we have done in our previous budgets, of course, which have seen success for the Canadian economy. EOS BOS I do not know where he gets his job numbers from, but the truth, through Stats Canada, is that the Canadian economy has created 900,000 net new jobs since the worst part of the recession. EOS BOS Our plan is working. EOS BOS When he talks about the manufacturing sector, here is what the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters Association has said:The government's policies with respect to taxes, technology, trade, training, and transformation are extremely important in setting the stage for growth of advanced manufacturing industries in Canada. EOS BOS They are the experts. EOS BOS They agree with us. EOS BOS The NDP members do not know what they are talking about. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the Halifax explosion, when a munitions explosion killed 1,600 people, injuring thousands more. EOS BOS It was also the largest loss of firefighters in a single event in Canadian history. EOS BOS To mark this anniversary, the Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Service hosted the annual firefighters memorial weekend in Ottawa earlier this month. EOS BOS Honoured at that memorial was my constituent Jeffrey Lilly, a 15-year veteran of the Lunenburg and District Fire Department. EOS BOS Could the minister tell us what the government is doing to support the brave firefighters who put themselves at risk to keep us safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, firefighters are community heroes, and we have been pushing an agenda to support their needs by restoring search and rescue funding, developing an action plan to deal with operational stress injuries, and creating a fund for families of firefighters who fall in the line of duty. EOS BOS We have also designated the second Sunday in September as Firefighters National Memorial Day, beginning last week with flags lowered in honour of those who have lost their lives protecting the rest of us. EOS BOS They have our deepest gratitude and our enduring respect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report outlines the serious problems that affect the disability benefits paid to injured veterans. EOS BOS Claude Rainville's wife, Jenifer Migneault, was desperately trying to speak to the Minister of Veterans Affairs earlier this year. EOS BOS He ran away from her. EOS BOS Jenifer was forced to quit her job to take care of her husband. EOS BOS Why is this government dragging its feet when it comes to taking care of people like Jenifer and her husband? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has a strong record when it comes to providing benefits and services for Canada's veterans, which is precisely why we have spent over $30 billion since taking office. EOS BOS That is $5 billion more than what the Liberals would have spent in additional dollars. EOS BOS We will take no lessons from the Liberals over there. EOS BOS Canadians still remember that it was under the Liberal government that our men and women in uniform suffered a decade of darkness. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 15,000 veterans applied for disability benefits for mental health services since 2006. EOS BOS Nearly one-quarter were denied. EOS BOS One-third appealed, and 65% of them received the benefits they deserve. EOS BOS What of those frustrated and hurting who did not appeal, veterans who fought for our country and did not expect to have to fight against it to get help? EOS BOS What is the government doing to help those frustrated thousands the Auditor General identified who gave up, even though many were entitled to the mental health benefits they were denied? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our commitments in the Veterans Affairs' mental health action plan are very clear. EOS BOS We are improving the disability benefit application process to reduce barriers to a timely access to benefits. EOS BOS We are strengthening our outreach effort to better inform the reserve forces of mental health care services, as well as reaching out to families and family physicians. EOS BOS We will measure and report on the effectiveness of our mental health strategy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Gregory Matters was a long-serving member suffering from PTSD and released from the forces in 2009. EOS BOS In 2012, he was shot and killed by the RCMP in Prince George while he was acting erratically. EOS BOS That very same day, Veterans Affairs had called Greg, saying that his claim for PTSD was finally approved but that he that still faced more hoops to jump through before any payment would flow, and this was after literally years without help or compensation. EOS BOS In fact, Greg had been treated by a psychiatrist, but on his own dime. EOS BOS Why will the Conservatives not stop pretending everything is okay and fix this tragic mess? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has consistently increased its support for Canadian veterans. EOS BOS Last week, we announced an additional $200 million investment to strengthen mental health services for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans, and their families. EOS BOS Our veterans' mental health is something our government takes very seriously, and we will continue to improve upon those services. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, many Quebec stakeholders gathered at the Quebec National Assembly to talk about the NAFTA negotiations. EOS BOS The Premier of Quebec and these socio-economic stakeholders were clear. EOS BOS They will not back down when it comes to supply management and the cultural exemption. EOS BOS The Premier of Quebec even said that the American administration's demands were extreme and unacceptable. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Foreign Affairs be firm with Donald Trump and tell him that supply management and the cultural exemption are non-negotiable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for her question and assure her, my colleagues, Quebeckers, and Canadians that the cultural exemption is a priority for our government. EOS BOS Supply management is also a priority for our government. EOS BOS These are tough negotiations because we are dealing with a most protectionist administration, but we are working and will continue to work to defend Canada's national interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have yet to stand up to the bullying tactics by the Trump administration. EOS BOS U.S. trade representative Lighthizer has said it is “unreasonable to expect that the United States will continue to...guarantee U.S. companies to invest in... EOS BOS Canada primarily for export to the United States” in NAFTA. EOS BOS This is a serious swipe at our manufacturing supply chains in Canada and our jobs. EOS BOS Enough is enough. EOS BOS Even the Liberal member for Kenora agrees that being charming and polite is not working. EOS BOS We need a stronger approach. EOS BOS When will the minister stand up against these blatant and extremely aggressive U.S. threats? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me assure the member opposite and all Canadians that at the negotiating table, I absolutely stand up for the Canadian national interests. EOS BOS I believe that it is right to be polite and when we say “no”, we say “no” with a smile. EOS BOS However, I want to say for Canadians that we will always stand up for our national interests and we will stand up for Canadian values. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Canadians are facing a retirement security crisis. EOS BOS The minister has been briefed on the fact that Canada spends significantly less on public pensions than other OECD countries. EOS BOS He has been briefed on the reality that young people today simply are not able to save enough for retirement. EOS BOS When he meets with the provinces, will the minister make it crystal clear that the federal government believes CPP must be expanded so that Canadians can retire in dignity and security? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, every Canadian shares the goal of a secure retirement. EOS BOS That is why our Minister of Finance, in one of his first acts, met with provincial ministers of finance in order to look at CPP enhancement. EOS BOS I am proud to say that under his leadership, on Monday, provincial ministers of finance will meet with him in order to ensure Canadians can retire in dignity. EOS BOS This government is going to pursue that policy because retiring in dignity is one of our priorities. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, vague answers about pensions are always worrisome. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Minister of Finance tried to reassure us. EOS BOS The problem is that he finished his answer by saying, “ EOS BOS I hope to have something positive to report to this House in the coming days. EOS BOS ” No one can retire comfortably on hope. EOS BOS Will the minister commit to end the meeting with the provinces with nothing less than an agreement to enhance the pension plan? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. EOS BOS My colleague should be pleased because our Minister of Finance is dealing with the pension problem in Canada. EOS BOS It would be pretentious to make assumptions about the outcome of the meeting. EOS BOS This government is open and co-operative. EOS BOS We invited the provinces in December. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance will be meeting with his provincial counterparts in Vancouver on Monday. EOS BOS We will continue to work hard to ensure that all Canadians can retire with dignity. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, over the past eight years, $1.1 billion that should have been used to help veterans was funnelled back into federal coffers because of the minister's incompetence and his chronic inability to process claims properly. EOS BOS Two years ago, he was told that his department had seriously underestimated the number of veterans who need help. EOS BOS He did absolutely nothing to address the situation. EOS BOS In fact, he made it worse. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister get rid of the Minister of Veterans Affairs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has delivered, and today there are more services, more benefits and more points of service for our veterans than ever before. EOS BOS Here are the facts. EOS BOS The opposition voted against expanding funeral and burial funding. EOS BOS It voted against career transition services. EOS BOS It even voted against the children of deceased veterans education assistance program. EOS BOS We take no lessons from a party that speaks one thing and does another. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, ministerial responsibility is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. EOS BOS That person has caused the harm. EOS BOS He shut down nine veterans offices and allowed $1.1 billion to lapse when veterans needed help, and he says that it is somebody else's fault. EOS BOS No, he is responsible. EOS BOS What is he waiting for to finally, for once in his life, do the honourable thing and resign? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have brought in real services and real programs for our veterans, and we will continue to do so in spite of the opposition voting against every one of those items. EOS BOS The reality is that those members voted against disability and death compensation. EOS BOS They voted against the earnings loss and supplementary retirement benefits. EOS BOS They voted against the veterans independence program. EOS BOS I hardly think we need to take any lessons from a party that says one thing and does exactly the opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Jean-Pierre Kingsley clearly indicated that the Conservatives' election “deform” bill is unacceptable in its current form. EOS BOS It is unthinkable that the government would get rid of the vouching system, which allowed tens of thousands of people to vote in 2011.It is also unacceptable that the Conservatives are trying to muzzle the Chief Electoral Officer by preventing him from informing and educating the public. EOS BOS Will the minister listen to the recommendations of experts such as Kingsley and Mayrand, who know a lot more about the subject than he does? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are rules in place to safeguard the vouching system. EOS BOS However, unfortunately, according to Elections Canada's report, these rules were broken in 50,000 different instances during elections. 
							[ EOS BOS English]When it was revealed that there were 50,000 irregularities related to vouching, this is what the leader of the NDP said. EOS BOS “If we can’t even guarantee that the people who are voting are entitled to vote, and that can throw off the results of the elections, all is being lost”. We agree, and that is why we are asking people to simply bring their choice of among 39 different forms of ID to prove who they are and where they live. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance is collecting dividends from his family business, Morneau Shepell. EOS BOS Yesterday we learned that Morneau Shepell does business with Bombardier. EOS BOS As everyone knows, Bombardier got millions of dollars from the government. EOS BOS When a subsidized company contributes indirectly to Morneau Shepell's bottom line, that clearly puts the finance minister in conflict of interest. EOS BOS My question is a simple one: did the minister recuse himself from all discussions about subsidies with Bombardier? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, the Minister of Finance has always worked with the Ethics Commissioner and will continue to do so transparently and proactively to make sure he is in full compliance with the rules that govern us all and to avoid any conflict of interest. EOS BOS By virtually every economic indicator, the Conservatives gave us our worst 10 years since the Second World War, and they neglected the middle class, so I can understand why they might not like it when we compare their record to ours. EOS BOS Our finance minister's record speaks for itself: 400,000 jobs, a 40% reduction in child poverty, and 900,000 seniors with more money in their pockets thanks to the guaranteed income supplement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government does not like the fact that we are focusing on the Minister of Finance's conflict of interest. EOS BOS The government does not like it because what we are saying is true: the minister is working for his own personal interests, when he is in a conflict of interest, and not the interest of all Canadians. EOS BOS We have a number of examples, including Bill C-27 and the Bombardier deal. EOS BOS In any case, the most flagrant is the fact that the minister said he was going to put his assets in a blind trust, but he failed to do so for two years. EOS BOS He misled the House about that. EOS BOS How can the Minister of Finance continue to act as the government's bagman while being in a conflict of interest because of his personal affairs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance can fulfill his role by acting on the recommendations of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and working with her, as he has done from the very beginning, to ensure full compliance with the laws and rules that govern us in the House. EOS BOS That is what he has been doing since he was elected and what he continues to do. EOS BOS He did even more than what the commissioner recommended. EOS BOS Now the Minister of Finance is focusing on working for all Canadians, for the Canadian economy, as he has done brilliantly for the past two years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today we have learned that Morneau Shepell is managing Bombardier's insurance and pension plans. EOS BOS As former chairman, the Minister of Finance would have known about this contract. EOS BOS Clearly, the finance minister's family company has a huge interest in Bombardier's survival. EOS BOS Last year, the Liberals gave a bailout of over $300 million to this company. EOS BOS Did the Minister of Finance recuse himself from all discussions around the Bombardier bailout? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. EOS BOS member that the Minister of Finance has always worked with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and acted on her recommendations, one of which was to set up an ethical screen early on to prevent any conflict of interest. EOS BOS That screen has been in place since his election and still is. EOS BOS Last week the minister announced that he would go even further in order to avoid any distraction and continue the work he is doing for Canadians, which is to ensure growth and prosperity for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as much as the Liberals are hoping to just move along, the fact is that these are very serious conflicts of interest. EOS BOS Canadians have questions. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance, whether he likes it or not, answers to Canadians. EOS BOS Regarding the connections with Bombardier that the Minister of Finance has, did the finance minister inform the Ethics Commissioner that Morneau Shepell did business with Bombardier, or did he forget about that just like he forgot about his villa in France? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can reassure the member that the Minister of Finance has, from the get-go, worked with the Ethics Commissioner in a transparent, forthcoming, and proactive manner to make sure he respects all the rules and follows all the recommendations, namely, to put up a conflict of interest screen, which he has done. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance will keep working for Canadians, as he has done with remarkable results, growing our economy at the fastest pace in the G7. EOS BOS We are the envy of the world under the stewardship of the finance minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister finally visited the Montérégie region today, more than one month after the flooding started. EOS BOS The Prime Minister reluctantly made a flyover visit, and, what is more, he is not responding to the immediate demands of officials and the people affected. EOS BOS As the mayor of Saint-Paul-de-l'Île-aux Noix said, “I do not think that [the Prime Minister] understands what we have been going through all along.”The 3,000 victims of the flooding in the Montérégie region are no less deserving than the victims in Manitoba and Alberta. EOS BOS Yet the Prime Minister still refuses to change the army's mandate. EOS BOS The flood victims simply want the army to help with the cleanup. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister listen to reason? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Forces will remain in these regions during the emergency period to provide assistance to the civilian authorities, until their specific skills are no longer needed. EOS BOS (1510)[English]The member would know that the regional minister for Quebec attended the flood-ravaged area, as did the Minister of Veterans Affairs and myself. EOS BOS Our thoughts are certainly with the people of the region. EOS BOS We will continue to work with them as members of the Canadian Forces continue to go about their important work there. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a recent lawsuit by the SSN is looking to declare aboriginal title over private property. EOS BOS The Premier of British Columbia responded that government must defend with conviction the sanctity of private land and private land rights. EOS BOS Furthermore, she told the people of Kamloops she has their backs. EOS BOS There was no such message from the federal government. EOS BOS Will the justice minister stand shoulder to shoulder with the premier of B.C. and defend private property ownership? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. EOS BOS Our government is committed to developing a substantive nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous peoples in this country, sitting down and working jointly, based on recognition and moving forward in order to ensure that indigenous communities can have an improved quality of life, can settle, ultimately, the land question, and do it based on respect and based on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the finance minister has been artfully dodging questions about his own foreign tax shelters, it turns out that exactly a year ago, his billion-dollar company, Morneau Shepell, was registered in Barbados where he only pays tax at a rate of two and a half per cent. EOS BOS Yet, he is asking Canadian small business owners to pay tax at a rate of 73%. EOS BOS How do they spell “hypocrisy”? EOS BOS Again, for the artful dodger himself, can he tell this House whether any of his proposed tax increases would actually apply to him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the minister left the company before taking up his duties as minister. EOS BOS He has always worked with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner with complete transparency to make sure he complies with the rules at all times. EOS BOS I want to reassure the opposition member that we will always stand behind our small business owners. EOS BOS We are keeping their tax rate the lowest in the G7 to promote growth, because we know small business owners contribute to this country's prosperity. EOS BOS That being said, the fact is that our current tax system has some inequities we need to correct. EOS BOS We have made a very clear commitment to the middle class to build a fairer tax system. EOS BOS We are in the process of reviewing the comments we heard from coast to coast. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us use Remembrance Day to honour our veterans and not use it for political purposes. EOS BOS Military commanders on the ground broke the Liberals' cone of silence because “they want the Canadian public to have a better understanding of the...mission” in Iraq. EOS BOS The Liberal government not only has attempted to silence our military, it continues to mislead Canadians by insisting we are in a non-combat role. EOS BOS Lieutenant Colonel Steve Hunter confirmed Canadians troops had been the first ones to engage the enemy on multiple occasions. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Defence finally be honest, acknowledge that our troops are in combat, and apologize for misleading Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, regardless of where we send our troops in the world, regardless of operations, we are going to make sure they have a robust engagement, and we can be proud of their work. EOS BOS On the information the member opposite is talking about in terms of the rules of engagement, our soldiers have a duty to protect civilians at times. EOS BOS Our troops are fulfilling this mission within the appropriate advise and assist mandate. EOS BOS Our Chief of the Defence Staff was at committee today. EOS BOS I have a tech brief that will be presented tomorrow. EOS BOS Also, we have journalists right now reporting on this in theatre. EOS BOS That is open and transparent in what we are providing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence is playing word games.We know full well that there are troops on the ground. EOS BOS Indeed, the words “assist”, “train”, “advise” and all the other possible words they can think of in French or English are being used. EOS BOS What we want is for the government to tell us whether Canadian troops are engaging in combat in any way. EOS BOS Canadians need to truly know whether the Canadians in combat are really on the ground. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I stated before, our troops are in the advise and assist function, but they have robust rules of engagement to protect themselves. EOS BOS In many cases, they need to protect not only themselves but their coalition partners and civilians. EOS BOS This is imperative. EOS BOS They have a duty to do so. EOS BOS I am proud of the work they are doing in fulfilling their mission in an honourable manner. EOS BOS When we conduct any operations around the world, we make sure they have the right capability, the right equipment, and robust rules of engagement to carry out their mission. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 13 days remain until the government must decide whether to appeal the decision of the Federal Court ordering it to cease clawing back veterans' pensions from people like Dennis Manuge. EOS BOS It has been almost three weeks, and we still have no indication of what the government will do. EOS BOS We are still not sure whether the Minister of National Defence has managed to read the 31-page court decision. EOS BOS The Conservatives have two choices: appeal the Federal Court decision or do the honourable thing and accept it. EOS BOS Which is it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, the Government of Canada is currently studying the decision and considering the next steps. EOS BOS No decision has been made at this point in time, so it is premature to assume that any decision has been taken or will be taken until such time as we make up our minds as to what needs to be done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, former Premier Dunderdale of Newfoundland and Labrador was there to announce that there was a deal with the federal government: $280 million would flow to Newfoundland and Labrador as compensation for the European trade deal. EOS BOS Now we find out that the government is imposing conditions that will mean, in practical effect, that the $280 million it promised will never flow. EOS BOS Why did the government make the promise to Newfoundland and Labrador and break it such a short while later? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to working out the details of this minimum processing requirement fund with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. EOS BOS The fund was created to compensate for anticipated losses from the removal of minimum processing requirements. EOS BOS The fund was never intended as a blank cheque that would give the industry of Newfoundland and Labrador an unfair advantage over other Atlantic provinces. EOS BOS We have been very clear from the start that the MPR fund was to compensate for demonstrable losses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday the Minister of Foreign Affairs was asked directly whether the government had been asked to extend the C-17 deployment in Mali. EOS BOS He replied, “ EOS BOS Not at this time”. EOS BOS Then yesterday, the Minister of National Defence told reporters that in fact Canada had received such a request “a few days ago”. EOS BOS Not consulting properly before announcing decisions is a worrying tendency by the government. EOS BOS I have a very simple question. EOS BOS Why did the minister fail to inform the committee about this request? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in response to direct requests from the French government, Canada has provided heavy lift aircraft and we have extended the support until March 15. EOS BOS Parliamentary hearings have been taking place where some witnesses have suggested that there be a Canadian combat mission. EOS BOS Let me be very clear that this government is not considering a combat mission and neither would it train Malian forces. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Liberals claim they are listening to Canadians, but all their actions point to arrogant Liberal political self-interest. EOS BOS Changing the way we vote should not be about a committee of politicians, it should not be about the Prime Minister, and it should not be about the self-interest of political parties. EOS BOS It has to start being about what Canadians want. EOS BOS Will they give each and every Canadian a direct say through a referendum, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be here on this traditional Algonquin territory with my colleagues on this fine Friday. EOS BOS I do believe that the member opposite and I agree that we need to listen to Canadians, that we need to hear from them. EOS BOS This is about them. EOS BOS This is their electoral system that we are trying to modernize. EOS BOS We will do that by leveraging the commitment and the options that the members in this House have to reach out to their constituents and bring their voices into this effort. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, those are fine words, but it has to be more about the actions than the words, and we are not seeing it in the actions. EOS BOS Liberals set up a committee that is made up of politicians, by politicians, and for politicians. EOS BOS That is all we keep hearing from them. EOS BOS We have actually seen them start to charge people entrance into their so-called open town halls. EOS BOS A newsflash to the Liberals: this should not be about their self-interest; this should be about all Canadians and their interests. EOS BOS Will they give Canadians, each and every one of them, a direct say in a referendum, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank the parties in this House which have brought forward the names of the individuals they would like to see represented on the all-party committee, to reach out to Canadians, to hear from experts and academics, to hear from those who have come before us in this place, and also to reach out to our constituents to make sure their voices are heard. EOS BOS I hope that the party opposite has had the time to put the names of its representatives forward. EOS BOS I look forward to the committee beginning its work as early as next week. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, today I will quote a Liberal to the Liberals: Our democracy belongs to its citizens, and it is the voters of this province that should decide how their representatives should be elected. EOS BOS That was the Liberal minister for democratic renewal announcing, almost 10 years ago today, the Ontario referendum on changing the province's voting system. EOS BOS After conducting a far more credible consultation process than that proposed by the Liberal government, those Liberals still had a referendum. EOS BOS Why will these Liberals not hold a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I note that the member is wearing a plaid tie on this very important day, raising awareness about prostate cancer EOS BOS .I would like to assure him that the efforts we are about to undertake to reach out to constituents across this great country will involve listening and will involve reflecting their wishes in this process. EOS BOS I am counting on the member opposite to hear from his constituents especially, and to bring all voices, a range of diverse opinions, into this conversation. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, I will continue with the same referendum announcement from June 20, 2006: The adoption of a new electoral system would represent a foundational change to Ontario's democracy. EOS BOS This is an important decision that would require the support of a solid majority of Ontarians.... Holding a referendum is what we do in Canada before we change how the people get to exercise their franchise. EOS BOS When the Liberal cabinet finally proposes its new voting system in 2017, will the Liberals allow Canadians to make the final say in a referendum, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, if that is truly what the member opposite believes, where was this push for good process and referenda when his government pushed through the Fair Elections Act? EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Ontario Liberal government, 10 years ago, announced a referendum on electoral reform. EOS BOS A quote from the committee at the time stated: Legitimacy must also apply to the process by which electoral reform is achieved. EOS BOS [...] A key ingredient to that process will be measuring public support through a plebiscite or referendum.... Will the minister agree to hold a referendum on electoral reform to make the process legitimate, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. EOS BOS I believe this is the first time he has asked me a question in this House. EOS BOS I can assure him that in 2016, we will use all the tools and options available to us to ensure that the process is legitimate, that we hear from Canadians. EOS BOS We will not move forward with any reforms without the broad support of the people of this country. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Ontario Liberal minister who headed up the Ontario referendum process 10 years ago still supports having a referendum. EOS BOS She recently said that if we are going to totally change the election system, “ EOS BOS I think it would have to be a referendum”.Will the Liberals hold a referendum on any changes to how Canadians vote, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. EOS BOS I can assure him that we are about to undertake a thorough conversation with Canadians, hearing from them what reforms they would like to see reflected in their electoral system. EOS BOS Should we consider online voting? EOS BOS Should we consider mandatory voting? EOS BOS These are the among the questions that we need to ask Canadians. EOS BOS I look forward to the work of all 338 members to reach our goal. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two years ago, the Auditor General informed us that the Conservatives were underestimating veterans' needs and that demand would probably go up. EOS BOS What did the minister do? EOS BOS He cut 1,000 jobs, and the biggest cuts were made to front-line programs for health, financial and transition services. EOS BOS The minister is not only incompetent; he is also mean. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister putting up with this? EOS BOS When will he show this incompetent and insensitive minister the door? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we support our veterans. EOS BOS The reality is that we voted for many of the benefits and services for veterans and their families. EOS BOS However, let me just inventory a few of the items that the Liberal Party voted against. EOS BOS They are the veterans independence program, the earnings lost benefit, the supplementary retirement benefit, the financial support program, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, career transition services, the disability allowance, and many more. EOS BOS Again, the hypocrisy is more than anybody can really believe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it was convenient, the Prime Minister praised the new veterans charter. EOS BOS For example, in 2006, in speaking with veterans, he claimed to support the troops and noted, “ EOS BOS This veterans charter is one example of our government’s commitment”. EOS BOS However, when it became clear how badly his government had mismanaged that supposed commitment, he rushed to blame the charter on a previous government. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has been exposed for his mean-spirited neglect of our veterans. EOS BOS How can they possibly trust anything he says? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since the advent of the new veterans charter, what this government has done consistently year after year, while the opposition has voted against it, is enhance the benefits, the services and the delivery of programs for veterans and their families. EOS BOS We have been delivering for our veterans. EOS BOS We continue to do so, while the opposition opposes everything we do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Leony Pavithra Lawrence is a perfect example of a refugee who has adjusted well to life in Quebec and makes Quebec even stronger, but the government wants to deport her and her entire family. EOS BOS The school board is calling on the government to reverse its decision. EOS BOS The opposition in Quebec City, much like the opposition here, is calling on the government to reverse its decision. EOS BOS The Government of Quebec, with the support of Quebec society as a whole, says it wants to find a way to keep the Lawrence family in Quebec. EOS BOS They will be deported on Sunday if no action is taken immediately. EOS BOS Will the government reverse its decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns of the member opposite. EOS BOS As members know, pursuant to Canadian privacy laws, we cannot discuss individual cases. EOS BOS Every case is unique and is assessed on its own merit. EOS BOS In accordance with Canadian law, our government is committed to submitting each case to IRCC where it will be assessed fairly and based on merit. EOS BOS All applicants can expect fair and impartial treatment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to come back to certain events that took place in 2009, when the Minister of Industry visited the private hunting cabin belonging to Marcel Aubut. EOS BOS The serious thing is that at the time, Mr. Aubut was involved in efforts to secure public funding for a new arena in Quebec City. EOS BOS A “ EOS BOS senior” EOS BOS minister should not have put himself in that kind of compromising situation. EOS BOS I repeat: why did the minister do that? EOS BOS What was he thinking? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate, it was a hunting trip like the others I have been on in my life. EOS BOS I paid my own way. EOS BOS I took my own car. EOS BOS I got there under my own steam and took my own equipment. EOS BOS Mr. Aubut never lobbied me, either before or after that trip. EOS BOS And after that, we mounted a campaign to tell Canadians that the federal government would not fund professional sports. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, are there just no limits to Conservative corruption? There is a second breach of ethics by the Minister of Industry and still he sits in cabinet. EOS BOS On the in and out scandal, the Prime Minister stonewalled for years. EOS BOS Now, after paying back $230,000 virtually stolen in rebates, he has not apologized to this House or Canadians. EOS BOS And on election fraud perpetrated by the Conservative Party, there is not even a sign of humility from the Prime Minister or the government. EOS BOS Why the utter contempt by this Prime Minister for democracy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that was quite a laundry list by the member for Malpeque. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the members on this side and Canadians at home, some 34 million of them, for the member for Scarborough—Rouge River, would really like to know where this indignation from this member was when his party siphoned some $360 million, $43 million of which is still missing. EOS BOS Where is the indignation? EOS BOS Why does this member not stand up right now and say where that missing money is? EOS BOS That is money stolen from Canadians. EOS BOS This party has stood in defence of Canadian taxpayers from coast to coast to coast and we will not stop. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year, the Human Rights Tribunal found the federal government guilty of discrimination against first nations children. EOS BOS An internal memo confirms that Health Canada knew about this serious problem and had no intention of making any changes. EOS BOS After two years and three compliance orders, the Liberals have done nothing. EOS BOS When will the minister address this major problem that has been lingering in her department or does her government's most important relationship not include indigenous children? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the documents the member opposite is referring to are based on Jordan's principle, which was passed in the House in 2007. EOS BOS Tragically, there were zero cases approved under the previous government. EOS BOS As soon as our government came into power, we got the resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to fully implement Jordan's principle.
               I am pleased to report to the House that now 20,000 cases have been approved. EOS BOS Children are getting access to the care they need, and we will continue to do this work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, so speaks the woman who is fighting Cindy Blackstock in federal court. EOS BOS The government has fought Cindy Blackstock for 12 years tooth and nail, and now it is is fighting her in court. EOS BOS Internal documents show that when the ruling came down, her top officials did not even know what Jordan's principle was or how children were being routinely denied services. EOS BOS Health Canada did draw a line in the sand, that it would not accept the definition that would “ensure that First Nations children have access to the same publicly funded health and social services”. EOS BOS Will the minister please explain why indigenous children do not have that right under her government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by correcting the record. EOS BOS In fact I am working very closely with Dr. Cindy Blackstock. EOS BOS I meet with her on a regular basis, including yesterday, and my staff meets with her regularly as well. EOS BOS We are determined to bring justice to indigenous children in this country. EOS BOS We know that there are absolutely unacceptable gaps that exist in child and family services and that children are being apprehended at rates that are the highest in the world. EOS BOS We will work with Dr. Cindy Blackstock and first nations, Métis, and Inuit leaders to bring justice for indigenous children. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, new GDP numbers confirm what the Bank of Canada was saying, that Canadian economic growth is atrocious. EOS BOS The fact is that it has not grown at all in 2015. EOS BOS In fact, it has shrunk. EOS BOS The manufacturing sector has been hit particularly hard, with its output declining by almost a percentage point in February, following a decline in January. EOS BOS When Canadians needed a plan, the Conservatives delayed presenting a budget. EOS BOS With all the extra time to prepare the budget, why did the minister not present us with a plan for jobs and growth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have a few facts for the member opposite and for the House. EOS BOS Both the International Monetary Fund and the OECD are projecting that Canada will have the strongest economic growth in the G7 in the years ahead. EOS BOS In addition to that, for the seventh straight year, the World Economic Forum has ranked Canada's banking system as the soundest in the world. EOS BOS Our net debt to GDP ratio remains among the lowest, and organizations like Bloomberg ranked Canada as one of the most attractive places in the world to do business. EOS BOS Maybe those members should factor that in their questions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, just to be clear for the record, that question was for the Minister of Finance to answer. EOS BOS Today, GM has cut 1,000 jobs in Oshawa. EOS BOS Today, there are 160,000 fewer jobs for young Canadians than in 2008. EOS BOS The percentage of people unemployed for over a year has doubled since 2008. EOS BOS CIBC says that the quality of Canadian jobs is at its lowest in 25 years. EOS BOS With Canada's job market so weak, how can the Conservatives pretend everything is fine, and why do they refuse to present a real plan for jobs and growth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have a real plan: tax cuts, trade and training, which has created 1.2 million net new jobs in Canada. EOS BOS One of those job-creating tax cuts is the reduction in the small business tax rate. EOS BOS We all know that small businesses are the major drivers of job creation, but the Liberal leader announced that he would raise taxes on small businesses if he ever got the chance. EOS BOS This is the same leader who thinks that budgets balance themselves. EOS BOS Small businesses know better and that is why they support our government, our tax cuts, and ultimately they will support us in the next election. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the budget notwithstanding, the Canadian economy is in obvious trouble. EOS BOS It shrank in January, worse than first reported. EOS BOS February was flat. EOS BOS Oil and gas have tumbled. EOS BOS Manufacturing was supposed to pick up the slack, but it is dropping too. EOS BOS U.S. growth was supposed to pull Canada along, but that is not happening either. EOS BOS A thousand more jobs are gone today at GM. EOS BOS Thirty-five per cent of Canadian families are carrying debt ratios over 200%.Why did we waste two months for a pointless budget with no plan for growth and not even a basic job creation target? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have a one-point plan for the economy, and that is to raise taxes on the middle class. EOS BOS We learned last week from the Liberal leader that they propose to raise taxes on small businesses. EOS BOS Canadians know that budgets do not balance themselves. EOS BOS Hard work and discipline balanced our budget, and now we will help families balance their budgets by reducing their taxes with a total of $6,000 in tax savings for the average family of four. EOS BOS We have reduced taxes; the Liberals would raise them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, more than 50 years ago, thalidomide was prescribed to treat morning sickness in expectant mothers. EOS BOS Tragically, thalidomide caused serious and permanent physical and emotional damage to mothers, infants, and families. EOS BOS Canada's drug safety system has come a long way since the days when thalidomide was approved. EOS BOS I have been proud to be part of that change. EOS BOS I was pleased to support the call for full support to be provided to thalidomide survivors. EOS BOS I ask the Minister of Health to please update the House on the government's support for survivors. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, survivors have exhibited great courage in overcoming daily challenges throughout their lives. EOS BOS I was very pleased on Friday to announce that the government will be providing survivors with tax-free payments every single year, up to $100,000, for the rest of their lives to make sure that they are able to live in dignity. EOS BOS In addition, they will have access to an extraordinary medical assistance fund. EOS BOS We are very pleased to be able to support the survivors. EOS BOS In particular, I would like to thank Mercédes Benegbi, who is the head of the Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, for working so closely with me, with the entire House, and with the government. EOS BOS I want to congratulate her on a great victory. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all of this raises a question of how the government defines the middle class. EOS BOS There is $372 million for Bombardier billionaires; however, everyday Canadians will pay more for gas and groceries, kids' sports, Uber rides, beer, and bus passes. EOS BOS Why is the government taxing more from those who take the bus, so it can give more to those who take limousines? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question from my hon. colleague. I am just afraid that his memory is failing. EOS BOS The first thing that our government did was to reduce taxes for the middle class. EOS BOS Nine million Canadians are paying less tax. EOS BOS I would guess there are thousands in the member's riding today who are paying less tax because of the government. EOS BOS We invested in families. EOS BOS We invested in the middle class. EOS BOS We invested in infrastructure. EOS BOS That is what responsible government is doing. EOS BOS That is exactly what we will continue to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning I met with female university presidents. EOS BOS We discussed the challenges of social media messaging, opportunities to increase diversity in university leadership, and their plan moving forward. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Status of Women update the House on how this government is leading by example and delivering results for gender equality? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my hon. EOS BOS colleague from New Brunswick Southwest knows that gender equality is fundamental to our collective success as a country and is at the core of our government's feminist agenda, and we are seeing the results: more economic growth. EOS BOS In this pursuit, our words matter just as our actions do, so when members across the aisle label our daughters as feminazis, as Barbies, it sets us all back. EOS BOS Our sons and daughters are watching. EOS BOS Let us all lead by example. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 900 positions were eliminated at Veterans Affairs. EOS BOS That is more than a third of the unit that administers services and 372 positions in the health and rehabilitation unit. EOS BOS To mask their ideological cuts, the Conservatives claimed that this would not affect services. EOS BOS That is what got us into the mess we are in right now: veterans are dying before they can get the care they need and others are committing suicide. EOS BOS This makes no sense. EOS BOS What is the Prime Minister waiting for? EOS BOS When will he dismiss this completely incompetent minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the work that we on this side of the House have been doing, while the opposition constantly votes against our programs and services for veterans. EOS BOS We opened or announced new front-line medical facilities for veterans' mental health. EOS BOS We are working with family resource centres to support medically-released veterans and their families. EOS BOS We have shrunk the application and the paperwork to deliver more services upfront for our veterans. EOS BOS We have created new monthly financial benefits totalling thousands of dollars each year for seriously injured veterans. EOS BOS The opposition votes against all these things. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Veterans Affairs is totally out of touch. EOS BOS For two years, he has been unable to forecast the needs of his department; yet, he has done nothing to correct the situation, despite a stern warning from the Auditor General, who told him that his data did not take into account the growing needs of soldiers with post-traumatic stress. EOS BOS For the past two years, the minister has been laying off all kinds of staff and closing regional offices without knowing what the future needs would be. EOS BOS Now, he has to backtrack and rehire some staff. EOS BOS It is high time the Prime Minister gave veterans a nice gift by dismissing this irresponsible minister. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all of us on this side of the House are proud of the fact that we have been, and continue to, looking after the needs of our veterans and their families. EOS BOS We do that through the delivery of programs and services. EOS BOS Let me give the House just one example where the NDP voted against a program, and that was disability and death compensation benefits for our veterans. EOS BOS The New Democrats voted against that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have failed veterans every step of the way, and they refuse to take responsibility. EOS BOS A 2012 Auditor General's report warned that Conservative mismanagement was: creating a mess at Veterans Affairs; failing veterans on mental health issues and PTSD; and creating a state of confusion with front-line case managers. EOS BOS The Conservatives' response was to cut front-line staff and close regional offices. EOS BOS It is inexcusable. EOS BOS When will they finally fire the minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have brought in real services and real programs for our veterans, and we will continue to do so in spite of the NDP voting against all of these things. EOS BOS The reality is that the New Democrats keep voting against every program or measure that we have brought forward. EOS BOS They voted against disability and death compensation, earnings lost and supplementary retirement benefits and the veterans independence program. EOS BOS There are no lessons to be learned on this side of the House from that party which votes against the very things we are trying to achieve for our veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, question period is an opportunity for opposition parties to ask about government business. EOS BOS Common sense dictates that having a period for questions assumes answers. EOS BOS The NDP has proposed a practical motion simply requiring answers to be related to the questions that are asked. EOS BOS To be clear, Conservative ministers would still have the right to be wrong; we are just requiring them to be relevant. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives now do the right thing, stop their procedural tricks and support our motion to make Parliament more honest and more accountable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our Parliament enjoys the most accountable question period of any Parliament in the world. EOS BOS Questions come without notice on any subject and we have to be ready to answer them, unlike in the U.K. where, for example, notice is required, and only a limited number of ministers is available in any particular question period. EOS BOS However, I will say that the NDP motion, which is a one-way street, seeks to fully constrain the government without applying any new standards at all to the opposition to elevate the level of question period. EOS BOS This is simply unfair. EOS BOS We believe in two-way debates. EOS BOS We also believe that question period should be a two-way street, and the government should not be left with its hands tied while the opposition has a free hand. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today the Province of Saskatchewan is taking the first step toward Senate abolition. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister, just like the Liberal leader, defending the status quo for the Senate? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, this government has proposed, since the beginning, reforms to the Senate. EOS BOS In fact, it is the NDP that has opposed any reforms to the Senate. EOS BOS In fact, the NDP governments are actually right now before the court arguing that we should make Senate abolition virtually impossible to achieve. EOS BOS When it comes to the status quo in the Senate, the NDP is not the solution; it is part of the problem. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the Liberal government is doing everything it can to protect the finance minister with his conflicts of interest and his nine numbered companies with links to Barbados, villas in France, pension plans for Morneau Shepell, and now Bombardier, it is reaching into the pockets of disabled people to pay for its spending problem. EOS BOS Diabetes Canada says it is concerned that 80% of diabetics making applications are now being denied, whereas a year ago 80% were being approved. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals care more about protecting the wealthy finance minister than people with type 1 diabetes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is committed to ensuring that all Canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. EOS BOS The concerns raised by the groups are important. EOS BOS We have already met with these groups and we will continue to work with them. EOS BOS In contrast to the previous government, our government, in budget 2017, made this credit more accessible by allowing specialized nurse practitioners to fill out their patients' applications. EOS BOS I asked the agency to improve the collection of data on the credit in order to have a better understanding of the applications and the agency's decision-making process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, disability tax credit applications for type 1 diabetics have gone from 80% approval to 80% rejection since May 2017. EOS BOS Yesterday, the minister denied that she had anything to do with this, but we have obtained a letter that she wrote in July defending these rejections and confirming that CRA changed the forms for doctors. EOS BOS She wrote that “adults who independently manage their insulin therapy...are unlikely to meet the 14-hours...requirement”. EOS BOS Why did the minister defend these rejections? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all Canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. EOS BOS As I said, in contrast to the former government, we simplified the forms. EOS BOS Our government made the credit more accessible by allowing specialized nurse practitioners to fill out their patients' forms. EOS BOS We will always work on ensuring that people receive the credits to which they are entitled and that Canadians are protected. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, now that the Liberals have gouged small business owners and retail employees, they are going after people with type 1 diabetes. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Minister of National Revenue said that she had not given any specific instructions and that she did not know what was happening in her department. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance, on the other hand, sees everything that is going on as he looks down from his throne. EOS BOS He has put himself above the law and he is throwing his colleague under the bus. EOS BOS Can the Minister of National Revenue tell the House that people with type 1 diabetes will be retroactively entitled to the tax credit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I fully understand the concerns of people with diabetes. EOS BOS My husband died of diabetes-related complications. EOS BOS We met with diabetes advocacy groups and doctors, and we are continuing to work with public servants. EOS BOS We simplified the forms and we have hired specialized nurse practitioners. EOS BOS As I was saying, unlike the previous government, we will continue to work to make the disability tax credit even more accessible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals cut off diabetics from the disability tax credit with a stroke of the minister's pen. EOS BOS Meanwhile, they allow the finance minister to use loopholes so he can hide millions of dollars of investments from Canadians. EOS BOS However, when Canadians suffering from diabetes try to access the tax credit, the Liberals claim that they are somehow cheating the system. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals working so hard to protect the finance minister from paying his fair share while they go after Canadians suffering from diabetes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I fully understand what diabetes can mean for diabetics and their families. EOS BOS As I was saying, my husband died of diabetes-related complications. EOS BOS We worked with diabetes advocacy groups last year. EOS BOS We met with people from the diabetes association, and we worked with doctors. EOS BOS We remain focused on simplifying the forms and making the disability tax credit more accessible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if that is a promise, let us see the details in writing. EOS BOS I would remind Conservatives that they also promised to compensate Newfoundland and Labrador for giving up rules that protect our fish processing jobs. EOS BOS What happened to that promise? EOS BOS Tomorrow, the premier is coming to Ottawa to meet with the Prime Minister to find out what happened. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister agree to honour the terms of the commitment he made, or will this be a replay of the foot-dragging, promise-breaking, disrespect, and contempt that Conservatives showed to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians with the Atlantic accord? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member should better inform himself on this file. EOS BOS The fund was created to compensate for anticipated losses from the removal of minimum processing requirements. EOS BOS The fund was never intended as a blank cheque that would give the industry in Newfoundland and Labrador an unfair advantage over other Atlantic provinces. EOS BOS The Canada-European Union trade agreement represents an unprecedented opportunity for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and it would be a shame for anything to interfere with that. EOS BOS We have been very clear from the start that the MPR fund was to compensate for demonstrated losses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is a new argument. EOS BOS Yesterday, first nations in Canada and the United States signed a treaty to fight the tar sands expansion and distribution of tar sands oil. EOS BOS Like Quebeckers, they realized that the fight against climate change is urgent. EOS BOS The government says it wants to take action, but it has again refused to say no to energy east, a pipeline that will increase production of bitumen by 40%. EOS BOS There is no social licence for the project: first nations and the Quebec nation oppose it. EOS BOS Will the government finally abandon this toxic project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member knows that the government is committed to establishing a nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous peoples. EOS BOS She also will know that we have been moving across the country, deliberately and seriously, talking to indigenous leaders about real accommodation, as energy projects are now in front of the regulatory process. EOS BOS In all provinces of Canada, we will be looking very carefully at the impact of these developments on indigenous communities. EOS BOS The conversations and the consultations have been meaningful, and we hope for accommodation. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, in a little more than nine months, the new formula for health transfers will come into force, and it will deprive the provinces of $36 billion. EOS BOS During the election campaign, the Liberals said that they would renegotiate the transfers. EOS BOS Now is the time to take action. EOS BOS The premiers of Quebec and Saskatchewan have even said publicly that this takes time and have called for an increase to the transfers. EOS BOS When will the Liberals take this seriously? EOS BOS The future of our health care system is at stake. EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for her question. EOS BOS With an aging population and challenging conditions facing all governments, our system must adapt so that it delivers better care and better outcomes at a cost that is affordable. EOS BOS In budget 2016, we increased the Canada health transfer to $36.1 billion. EOS BOS We will continue to build upon the success of most recent health ministers meeting in Vancouver, and ensure that our common priorities can be addressed while protecting the provinces and territories ability to deliver the best possible care. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has the right to change the law, but the government does not have the right to break the law. EOS BOS That seems to be the critical question that the Prime Minister has lost. EOS BOS Let me ask the Prime Minister a question with respect to Attawapiskat. EOS BOS Without consultation with the band council, the government itself decided to set up a third party management; does the government think it is reasonable and fair that the band itself now has to pay the $1,300-a-day fee being charged by that individual, which could cost up to $300,000? EOS BOS Does the government not realize what kind of a burden that places on the band council itself? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, not only is the government already spending tens of millions of dollars in this particular community, it is also spending additional moneys on particular emergency needs because of mismanagement. EOS BOS It is the absolute responsibility of the government to ensure that those needs are met and to ensure the management steps are taken to make sure those needs are met. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if we look at the report of the Auditor General, it is the government's own mismanagement that is at stake in this question. EOS BOS It is the government's own failure to provide appropriate housing and education, not only in Attawapiskat but right across the board. EOS BOS [Translation]How can the government continue to talk about the management problems in Attawapiskat and elsewhere when it is clear that the government is responsible for the mismanagement resulting in the human and moral condition on these reserves? EOS BOS That is entirely the responsibility of the Government of Canada. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of blaming someone, but of taking action and finding solutions. EOS BOS [English]Once again, the government's responsibility is clear. EOS BOS We are investing not just millions of dollars, but hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in emergency services to make sure people are taken care of. EOS BOS The people of that community and the wider taxpayers of this country have an absolute right to ensure that the money is being used and being used effectively, and that is what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite the government's announcement, a lot of work remains to be done to save all the forestry jobs once and for all. EOS BOS Just yesterday, Unifor organized a day of action across the country, including in my home of Jonquière. EOS BOS I marched side by side with the workers to acknowledge the importance of the forestry sector, which is central to the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean communities. EOS BOS The former government left a lot of money on the table in the last agreement. EOS BOS Can the minister assure us that her government will not negotiate a sellout agreement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to defending Quebec's forestry sector and we continue to include it in all our negotiations. We strongly oppose the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to impose unfair countervailing duties. EOS BOS We will continue to work closely with our industry and provincial partners. EOS BOS A negotiated agreement would be the best outcome for Canadians and for the Americans. EOS BOS Nevertheless, we want a good agreement for Canada, not just any agreement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, workers are out in the streets fighting for their jobs because the Liberal government is failing to fix it. EOS BOS The failure of the Liberals to secure a deal on softwood is seriously threatening forestry jobs. EOS BOS On the eve of NAFTA renegotiations, the lack of a softwood deal is not inspiring much confidence. EOS BOS The Liberals like to talk about their respectful relationship with the U.S. and how they will get the best deal. EOS BOS How can Canadians trust the government to get a good deal on NAFTA when the Liberals continue to fail to get an agreement on softwood lumber? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we know, the previous Conservative government allowed the agreement to lapse. EOS BOS We strongly disagree with the U.S. commerce department's decision to impose unfair and punitive duties—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS parliamentary secretary has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will challenge this U.S. decision in the courts and we will win, as we have done on every past occasion. EOS BOS The Prime Minister raises softwood lumber with President Trump at every opportunity, just as the minister for global affairs and trade does. EOS BOS However, we want a good agreement for Canada, not just any deal. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. EOS BOS During question period, I believe the Minister of National Defence misspoke, and I would like to give him an opportunity to correct the record, when he said that we sent troops to Iraq without any support. EOS BOS I can tell members there was danger pay. EOS BOS He has an Order Paper question that he has tabled in the House under his signature, and I would like to point out for him that if he would look at Question No.— EOS </s> BOS This is a matter of debate. EOS BOS I do not think it is appropriate. EOS BOS This can be carried on in debate at another time, but it is debate, not a point of order. EOS BOS I am sorry. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the current Liberal government promised during the election to restore Canada's historic relationship with our veterans. EOS BOS First and foremost was the pledge to end the Conservatives' court battle that would deprive veterans of the benefits they deserve. EOS BOS The Liberals promised to honour those benefits, but now we learn they are backtracking and again taking our veterans to court. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals punishing our veterans and forcing them to fight in court for the benefits they deserve and have earned in service to Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member is aware, this lawsuit emerged under the previous government. EOS BOS I can say that this government is moving forward on treating veterans with care, compassion, and respect. EOS BOS We are moving forward on an aggressive mandate that is ensuring financial benefits to them. EOS BOS We saw that in budget 2016 with a $5.6-billion investment that would improve the lives of our most disabled veterans and ensure financial security for them and their families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, DFO's new rules on muzzling science and restricting the release of information have sent shock waves throughout the country. EOS BOS Now the Conservatives are trying to silence American scientists, as well, on the giant Arctic project in the north. EOS BOS DFO's new publication procedures are an unprecedented measure of political control of information. EOS BOS This is unacceptable. EOS BOS When will the government learn that muzzling science and information is an absolute shameful action that will cause our country a lot of harm? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Fisheries and Oceans is a science-based department. EOS BOS Our scientists give thousands of interviews a year and publish hundreds of papers, some of those in partnership with other non-DFO scientists. EOS BOS We understand that regional officials of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans advised scientists to seek approval before allowing external partners to publish articles that may include government intellectual property. EOS BOS That was done without political direction or the knowledge of the minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for the scientists who are left at DFO after the government's fire sale, morale is at rock bottom. EOS BOS The department is in tatters, and stress and uncertainty are far too common. EOS BOS The timeline to implement the destructive Fisheries Act changes keeps getting pushed back because the staff is simply not equipped to deal with the government's agenda. EOS BOS Will the government finally learn its lesson and reverse this destructive agenda? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no, we will not, because the common sense changes we are making to the Fisheries Act allow us to focus on commercial, aboriginal and recreational fishers in a way that the previous government was not able to do, and we are continuing on that path. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not true. EOS BOS It is all about big business for this particular government. EOS BOS Let us look at the turbot fishery. EOS BOS Last year, the turbot fishery was overfished by up to 60%. EOS BOS A major culprit, of course, was foreign overfishing. EOS BOS Now we have a situation where sources say that an agreement has been worked out between Ocean Choice International and a Japanese company, allowing it an international quota to be fished inside the 200-mile limit in 3K, which affects the smaller independent fishermen. EOS BOS Why is the government favouring big business over the smaller independent fishermen in 3K? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, none of that is true. EOS BOS I would be happy to relay those comments to the minister. EOS BOS However, the member will know that the changes that Canada has made to NAFO, for example, have strengthened our ability to combat overfishing. EOS BOS We are continuing to work in that area and are pleased with the results we have seen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday it was revealed that since 2007 over $47 million has been wasted on false search and rescue responses caused by outdated emergency beacons. EOS BOS When already overstretched search and rescue assets are deployed on a false alarm and are not available for a real emergency, that puts lives at risk. EOS BOS These beacons are outdated, ineffective, and harder to find in an emergency. EOS BOS They have not even been tracked by satellite since 2009 and the government has failed to act. EOS BOS When is the government going to ensure that these unsafe beacons are replaced? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, emergency locator transmitters are mandatory on all aircraft in Canada, and the band that is used is 121.5 MHz. EOS BOS That is accepted under our current regulations. EOS BOS As well, it is also used and monitored by search and rescue officials to help what we want to do, which is to find Canadians who are in distress so we can make the difference between life and death. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2007, Transport Canada recommended new mandatory digital beacons, but the Conservatives have done nothing since that time. EOS BOS It is not enough to simply accept the recommendations when a report is tabled. EOS BOS They then have to be implemented. EOS BOS The Conservatives are wasting time with useless studies when we already know the solution. EOS BOS The fact that search and rescue equipment is not available to respond to real emergencies is putting people's lives in danger. EOS BOS What does the government intend to do to address this problem once and for all, before a tragedy occurs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I take offence that the hon EOS BOS . member would think it is useless to conduct studies and to ensure we are putting in place the right type of framework in order to save Canadians' lives. EOS BOS What I can say is this. EOS BOS The report recommended that Transport Canada consider the use of emergency beacons in other modes of transportation. EOS BOS It initiated consultations with stakeholders, in 2013, as was recommended. EOS BOS Based on those consultations, my officials are doing a risk assessment to ensure that we do the right thing in this matter. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the immigration committee held two meetings to review how Canada is assisting Yazidi genocide survivors, and today I moved a motion to have the findings presented in a report and to have one additional meeting to hear directly from genocide survivors who have been resettled to Canada. EOS BOS In a shameful display and in front of Yazidi witnesses, the member for Surrey Centre moved to adjourn debate. EOS BOS The chair then shut down the committee without a vote on anything. EOS BOS I feel that this should be a non-partisan issue, so will the chair of the committee correct his error and commit to holding an extra meeting and tabling a report on this issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Calgary Nose Hill for her question and also for her commitment and her work for the Yazidi women, men, children, girls, and boys. EOS BOS The concern that she raised has come to our committee for the last two meetings. EOS BOS We have heard from officials and stakeholders. EOS BOS There is now a motion on the floor that we extend that by at least one more meeting, and that motion will be dealt with at the next meeting possible. EOS BOS I do need to add that, very personally, I think that more information and better information is very important for us, as we all are very concerned about Yazidi men and women and their settlement in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, government after government, be it Liberal or Conservative, has left seasonal workers out in the cold. EOS BOS The spring gap is when workers' benefits run out during the off-season because of bad employment insurance reforms. EOS BOS For some, the spring gap can last over four months. EOS BOS The Liberals broke their promise to scrap the Conservatives' reform, which penalizes seasonal workers and their families. EOS BOS When will this government keep its promises and help seasonal workers? EOS BOS Maybe in the upcoming budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when we were elected, we promised to restore employment insurance and reverse the Conservatives' changes, and that is exactly what we did. EOS BOS I would like to thank all our members from the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, and elsewhere in the country who worked with us to give seasonal workers the employment insurance options they need. EOS BOS Yes, we are very aware of the upcoming spring gap. EOS BOS That is why we are committed to working with them to address that challenge. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the F-35 procurement secretariat just released an update on this file. EOS BOS As we expected, the cost for Canadians has gone up again. EOS BOS It is now going to cost $45.8 billion to purchase, maintain and operate the F-35s. EOS BOS As if that were not enough, the last plane would not be ready until 2025. EOS BOS Confusion reigns and Canadians want to know how their money will be spent. EOS BOS Will the minister finally commit to holding an open and transparent bidding process? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, no decision has been made on replacing the CF-18 fleet. EOS BOS We want to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the equipment they need, which is why we are doing a life extension on the CF-18s so that they can run right through until 2025.In our commitment to transparency, we released three reports yesterday and all of the unclassified reports, and all of the information therein will be taken into consideration when a decision is made. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, rising costs and slipping timelines of the F-35s were laid out in careful detail in yesterday's independent review report. EOS BOS There could be $1 billion more in costs and the final purchase could be pushed back to 2025, a far cry from the $9 billion originally claimed in 2010. EOS BOS The report also says three other jets could equally meet Canada's needs. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives be having an open competition, or are they still in favour of a sole-sourced purchase of the F-35s? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, no decision has been taken as part of our seven-point plan. EOS BOS We commissioned several reports, and those are being evaluated. EOS BOS In fact, they have been released publicly. EOS BOS They were tabled yesterday. EOS BOS The information in those will be considered when a decision is made. EOS BOS Meanwhile, to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the equipment they need, we are doing life extensions so that the F-18 fleet can continue through 2025. EOS BOS Quite frankly, the NDP, the no defence party, has been arguing to buy absolutely nothing to support our troops. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has had these reports in its hands for months. EOS BOS The Pentagon has documents showing that we have already asked for earlier purchase of the F-35 and there is an entire secretariat devoted to this, so it hardly seems likely that a decision has not already been made. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us whether this proposed purchase has actually gone to cabinet? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not know how to make it more clear: no decision has been made. EOS BOS We are going to consider all of the information that has been prepared in the various reports, which were made public yesterday, and we will evaluate the different options to make sure that our men and women in uniform get the equipment they need at a price that is responsible to taxpayers. EOS BOS We will make sure that the troops have the equipment they need by doing life extension to 2025 on the CF-18s. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on International Women's Day, I asked the Prime Minister if he would take action to help protect Yazidi girls who have been forced to be sex slaves by ISIS. EOS BOS I asked if he would step up and ensure that Yazidi girls get placed in the joint sponsorship program so they can come to Canada. EOS BOS He had no answer. EOS BOS Yesterday we learned that another 19 Yazidi girls were burned alive for refusing to become sex slaves to ISIS terrorists. EOS BOS After three months of silence, I am still waiting for an answer. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals turning a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against these girls? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is certainly not what the Liberals are doing. EOS BOS Our acceptance of refugees is based on those who are most vulnerable, as determined by the United Nations, irrespective of religion. EOS BOS I might point out that in seven short months, we admitted twice as many refugees as the previous government did in a whole year, so I am proud of our record on refugees, especially compared to the previous government's. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one of the first actions taken by the Minister of Science was to recruit Professor David Naylor to review federal science funding. EOS BOS That is a great move. EOS BOS Our leader, Jagmeet Singh, who has a degree in biology, supports the Naylor report, as does most of Canada's scientific community. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us how many of the 35 report recommendations the government intends to implement, and most importantly, will it bring forward legislation to establish an independent national advisory council on research and innovation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government was elected on a promise to put science at the heart of decision-making. EOS BOS After a decade of neglect, I am working to put people, our researchers, at the heart of how we think about science and how we fund science. EOS BOS Whether that is by ensuring our young researchers have the supports they need to succeed or by addressing the chronic under-representation of women and visible minorities, our government will ensure that people are at the forefront of Canadian science. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Halifax's Leave Out Violence program, or LOVE program, does incredible work by helping extremely at-risk youth find and keep jobs in our community. EOS BOS There are glowing reports of its success. EOS BOS Everyone at the department recommended a renewal of LOVE's funding, but the minister denied its funding. EOS BOS How are people supposed to play by the rules when the minister changes the rules at whim, casts aside evidence, and ignores everyone's advice? EOS BOS Why is he denying funding to LOVE, a program with proven success in helping at-risk youth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, very simply, the proposed grant would have cost approximately $45,000 in tax dollars for every job created. I know that to the New Democrats there is no limit in the largesse with which they would have government EOS BOS spend tax dollars. EOS BOS We are committed to creating jobs and assisting youth at risk, which is why we invest enormously in skills development in that area. EOS BOS However, there has to be a practical limit. EOS BOS I know the New Democrats would be happy to spend $80,000 or $120,000, but we think that spending $45,000 in tax dollars to create one job is unreasonable and unjustifiable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my constituents are extremely concerned about the impending closure of the Terrebonne post office on October 26, 2012. EOS BOS This closure is part of a whole round of privatization of Canada Post services. EOS BOS Many local citizens and businesses will be affected by this senseless closure. EOS BOS Once again, for the Conservatives, profits come before people. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives so determined to undermine the economy of my riding by privatizing essential services like Canada Post services? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is an arm's length crown corporation that makes day-to-day operating decisions based on market demand. I know that is difficult for members of the NDP to understand, but EOS BOS if we want to make Canada Post viable in the long term, it will have to make adjustments from time to time. EOS BOS That is what Canada Post has done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our men and women in uniform have front row seats for the sad spectacle of the Liberals and the Prime Minister. EOS BOS For the past year, the opposition, experts, and the military have been telling the government to stop misleading Canadians with the unnecessary purchase of 18 Super Hornets. EOS BOS The minister has lost all credibility. EOS BOS Canadians also realize that the Prime Minister is improvising at the expense of national security. EOS BOS Can the government stop improvising and finally hold an open and transparent process to replace the fighter jets in order to give the military the equipment they are entitled to right now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was very proud, on behalf of the government's new defence policy, to be able to announce that we will be purchasing not 65 fighter aircraft but 88, making sure that we have a full, transparent competition to replace the entire fleet. EOS BOS We are investing in our legacy fleet as well. EOS BOS We do have a capability gap and we need to fill it to make sure that the air force has all the planes necessary to meet all their commitments simultaneously. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance does not seem to like discussing his personal finances. EOS BOS However, he is free to discuss them with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, as stated in the Conflict of Interest Act. EOS BOS With regard to Canada's tax treaty with Barbados, Canadians want the Minister of Finance to avoid getting into another conflict of interest. EOS BOS Yes or no, has he recused himself from all discussions about this tax treaty? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance has always worked with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, and he will continue to do so very transparently, openly, and proactively to make sure he is following all of the laws that govern us and following her recommendations as well. EOS BOS That is something he has been doing from the get-go, including putting a conflict of interest screen in place. EOS BOS Another thing the Minister of Finance has also been doing very successfully for the past two years is growing our economy. EOS BOS I understand why the Conservatives are reluctant to compare their track record with ours, because they would lose on all counts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Morneau Shepell is a financial services company with operations in Canada. EOS BOS We now know that it also holds a tax shelter corporation in Barbados. EOS BOS For two years, the finance minister secretly owned millions of dollars of Morneau Shepell shares. EOS BOS For two years, the minister resisted calls to address problems with the Canada-Barbados tax treaty, saying “ EOS BOS we’re not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater”—some baby, some bath water. EOS BOS Did the minister declare his Morneau Shepell Barbados tax treaty conflict of interest to the Ethics Commissioner, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for two years the finance minister has worked with the Ethics Commissioner to make sure all recommendations are followed. EOS BOS For two years, the finance minister has grown our economy at its fastest pace in the last decade; has reduced unemployment to its lowest level since 2008; has created 400,000 jobs, most of them full-time; has reduced child poverty by 40%; and has helped 900,000 seniors. EOS BOS That is what the finance minister has been doing for the last two years. EOS BOS Members should take note. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us try again. EOS BOS The finance minister secretly held millions of dollars of Morneau Shepell shares for the last two years. EOS BOS The same company has a tax shelter corporation in Barbados. EOS BOS The minister is responsible for negotiating the Canada-Barbados tax treaty. EOS BOS A good deal for Morneau Shepell in Barbados could mean a good deal of money for the minister. EOS BOS Did the minister declare his conflict of interest on the Morneau Shepell Barbados tax treaty file, did he recuse himself from the negotiations, or do ethics rules like this not apply to Liberals like him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that, as I said, the finance minister has always acted on the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner's recommendations, including her recommendation to set up an ethics screen to prevent any conflict of interest. EOS BOS The Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner said that was the best way to handle things. EOS BOS Last week, he took yet another step to keep doing his important work for Canada's economy and for all Canadians, to reduce inequality, and to bring prosperity to everyone in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Remembrance Day is a time for Canadians to pay unpoliticized tribute to the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform. EOS BOS It is also a time to pause and honour the loved ones they leave behind. EOS BOS Our government has consistently taken concrete and substantial action to support the men and women of Canada's military, veterans and their families. EOS BOS Would the Minister of National Defence inform the House as to what our government is doing to recognize the personal loss and sacrifice of the close family and friends of Canada's fallen? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Edmonton Centre for the question and also for his 31 years of service with the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS Today I was honoured to be with the Minister of Veterans Affairs to announce the creation of the Memorial Ribbon as part of our government's ongoing support to Canada's military and their families. EOS BOS The Memorial Ribbon will recognize loved ones of our fallen heroes who have not been recognized by a Memorial Cross. EOS BOS This demonstration of our continued care and concern for Canada's military families extends to our brave men and women who have served our country but also their families and loved ones who have sacrificed so much for us. EOS BOS We honour those families. EOS BOS We will never forget their sacrifices. EOS BOS Lest we forget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been a full year since Canadians voted out the Conservative government, which was a laggard on action on climate change. EOS BOS Canadians had high hopes for a new government, yet the Liberals are embracing what they once called Stephen Harper's woefully inadequate reduction targets. EOS BOS Canadians are just as troubled that the Liberal government has broken its promise for a new, fair environmental assessment process. EOS BOS How many more projects are going to be approved before Canadians are finally given a voice on the projects that impact them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to be standing here today representing the residents of Ottawa Centre a year after I was elected. EOS BOS We understand that the environment and the economy go together. EOS BOS We have worked extraordinarily hard this year to deliver on that promise. EOS BOS We have helped to negotiate an ambitious Paris agreement. EOS BOS We brought in the biggest budget in Canada's history. EOS BOS We are reforming our environmental assessment process. EOS BOS We entered into the historic clean tech climate change agreement with Mexico and the United States. EOS BOS We have ratified the Paris agreement. EOS BOS We put a price on pollution. EOS BOS We will keep on doing this because #realchange. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if only a hashtag did the trick. EOS BOS Last Thursday, a tanker barge spilled more than 200,000 litres of toxic diesel into the critical fishing areas off B.C.'s central coast. EOS BOS First nations leaders told me that the government's response has taken far too long, and done far too little to stop the devastation. EOS BOS In just one year, we have seen Haida Gwaii, English Bay, and now Bella Bella. EOS BOS Crossing our fingers and praying does not protect our environment. EOS BOS The Prime Minister promised to protect our beautiful B.C. coast with a permanent oil tanker ban. EOS BOS When is he actually going to finally bring that promise to reality? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to improving marine protection, and taking measures with respect to marine safety. EOS BOS We have been very clear on the fact that we are coming forward, shortly, with a coastal strategy that will improve marine safety off our coasts. EOS BOS We are very concerned, obviously, about the incident. EOS BOS We are responding as quickly as possible. EOS BOS That is a good indication of why we need to improve marine safety. EOS BOS That is what we are going to do. EOS BOS Stay tuned. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to look at the case of a single mother in Margaree Harbour in Cape Breton who contributes to the success of two seasonal industries. EOS BOS She works as a chambermaid during the tourism season and she makes Christmas wreaths at a small shop each fall. EOS BOS EI helps feed her family between seasons. EOS BOS Like many rural Canadians, she has no access to public transit or child care, and members should know this: her attitude is not defeatist. EOS BOS As the Prime Minister  now makes the rules for EI, in the case of this single mother, will she be packing or will she just be poor? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us face it, Canada is facing unprecedented shortages of labour and skills. EOS BOS We need to help Canadians who are unemployed to get back to work quickly. EOS BOS The changes that we are proposing will help the unemployed find jobs in their local area and will, at the same time, address the skills shortages faced by Canadian employers. EOS BOS Canadians will be expected to take jobs appropriate to their skill level in their area. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, recent comments by the  Minister of Finance reinforce the government's attitude toward those who are unemployed through no fault of their own. EOS BOS Clearly, it is the government's intention to force anyone looking for work to pack their bags and take whatever job is available, regardless of his or her circumstances. EOS BOS This would mean having to leave families behind for low-paying jobs, which would make it impossible for people to make ends meet. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister, whose prejudice against Atlantic Canadians is well known, forcing them to take jobs that would make them financially worse off? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all those statements are completely wrong. EOS BOS We are facing skills shortages right across the country right now. EOS BOS We need to help employers find the workers they need. EOS BOS We will help connect people who are out of work through no fault of their own get access to those jobs in their local area in their range of skills. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I will try a question for the regional minister for Prince Edward Island. EOS BOS With respect to employment insurance, we have heard the immigration minister insult both the unemployed and foreign workers, the Minister of Finance's comments yesterday were clearly an attack on the seasonal industry with this “just move” attitude, and now the minister's answers clearly show that cabinet does not understand seasonal workers and their needs. EOS BOS How can the minister stand in her place and allow Parliament to be passed over, Islanders to be blindsided and all decisions on employment insurance being made by the Prime Minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are facing skills shortages and labour shortages right across the country. EOS BOS We want to ensure that we help Canadians who are out of work through no fault of their own to get access to those jobs, help the employers stay in business so they can produce for the country and to help the families. EOS BOS We will help connect these people with jobs and, yes, they will be in their own area and within their appropriate skill level. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand there was a little noise in the chamber toward the end of question period, and you may not have heard the question by the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands. EOS BOS I think if you do check the blues on it, you may find that it does not fall under the administration of government. EOS BOS The position of the Conservative Party is not something the Prime Minister has to answer for. EOS BOS We are about to enter into tabling of documents, and during question period, the Prime Minister said that our party “a éliminé...le droit de vote”. EOS BOS I wonder if the government can table any evidence of anyone in Canada being disenfranchised. EOS </s> BOS First of all, as the hon. EOS BOS member very well knows, the rules of relevance are not all that strict here. EOS BOS In fact, the member for Saanich— EOS BOS Gulf Islands's question was about the voting electoral system, which is within the responsibilities of the government. EOS BOS [Translation]
              Now we will hear from the hon. EOS BOS member for Montcalm on a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to statements we just heard during question period. EOS BOS I am sure that if we ask— EOS </s> BOS Would the member please start over because his microphone was not on when he started. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in light of the statements made during question period, I am sure that if you were to ask all parties in the House about membership of the electoral reform committee, people would give the Green Party and the Bloc Québécois the right to participate and vote. EOS BOS I would like to move the following motion; “That the participation of the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party be governed by the same provisions governing all other members and include the right to vote”. EOS </s> BOS Does the member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: No. EOS BOS The Speaker: There is no consent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, then why is the government fighting them in court?A humpback whale was found dead, entangled in an empty net at a salmon farm near Campbell River. EOS BOS This is the second time a whale has been entangled in this fish farm in three months. EOS BOS The last time, a juvenile humpback was trapped and needed to be rescued at this same site. EOS BOS Open-net salmon farms are clearly a risk to marine mammals. EOS BOS Will the government eliminate this problem by supporting my bill to transition this industry to safe closed containment and protect marine mammals? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we obviously share our colleague's concern with respect to the protection of marine mammals. EOS BOS The circumstances around these humpback whale mishaps are obviously of huge concern to the government. EOS BOS This is why, two weeks ago, the Prime Minister, in a historic investment of $1.5 billion for ocean protections, put in place a series of measures that will not only ensure better protection of marine mammals but also make the scientific and operational investments to ensure that this kind of horrible incident does not happen again. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians cherish our democracy. EOS BOS Yesterday, they went to the polls in Lac-Saint-Jean in Quebec and Sturgeon River—Parkland in Alberta. EOS BOS Two new MPs were elected to represent their constituents with us here. EOS BOS Can the minister update the House on what our government is doing to strengthen our democracy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alfred-Pellan for his question.
              I was proud to introduce Bill C-50, which will make fundraisers for the prime minister, cabinet members, leadership contestants, and opposition leaders more open and transparent. EOS BOS I am pleased that the committee reported the bill back to the House yesterday. EOS BOS While I am up, I would like to congratulate the members for Lac-Saint-Jean and Sturgeon River—Parkland as well as all of the candidates and the volunteers who played an active role in our democracy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when Canada decides to use information obtained through so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, it implies that the Conservatives are authorizing things such as forcing detainees to stand even though they are injured, making sexual threats regarding detainees' families and depriving detainees of sleep for more than a week. EOS BOS Does the minister condemn torture? EOS BOS If so, will he refuse to use information obtained through torture in the future? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my hon. colleague that the issue she is referring to has to do with the American authorities, not American politicians. EOS BOS That being said, let me be clear: Canada does not condone the use of torture. EOS BOS However, if information that can save Canadian lives is brought to the attention of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service or our law enforcement agencies, I expect that information to be considered. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Senate report on the CIA's so-called enhanced interrogation techniques is very clear: torture is not only morally wrong, it does not work. EOS BOS Information obtained through torture is unreliable. EOS BOS However, despite this, the Conservatives have directed Canadian security agencies to use and share information obtained through torture. EOS BOS Why is the minister making Canadian agencies go along to get along with states that torture? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. EOS BOS Canada does not condone the use of torture. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I remember someone once saying that when someone is under the kind of cloud the Prime Minister admits his government is under, I would think they would use every opportunity to be as forthright as possible. EOS BOS Who said that? EOS BOS Oh, that was the Prime Minister. EOS BOS However, that was back when the Conservatives thought that telling the truth actually mattered to Canadians. EOS BOS Today is another day of questions. EOS BOS Will it be another day of changing stories? EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister aware of any other cheques from Nigel Wright to Mike Duffy? EOS BOS It is a simple question. EOS BOS How about a simple answer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me just begin by saying “ EOS BOS Happy Halloween”. EOS BOS Tonight is a night when kids will be all over the place. EOS BOS Hopefully everyone will help out. EOS BOS If people have somewhere to go, they should drive a little slower and take a little extra time so we do not have anything happen that will make this a bad day. EOS BOS I hope everyone will consider that. EOS BOS With respect to the question, we have been clear. EOS BOS Our party is no different from other parties when it comes to helping our members who require legal assistance. EOS BOS We do that unlike the NDP, of course, which not only provides legal assistance but actually pays judgments against those members. EOS BOS We do not have that double standard on this side of the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I remember a Prime Minister once saying, “ EOS BOS If you are throwing mud, you are losing ground.” EOS BOS Wait, that was just last week. EOS BOS I have a better expression for the Conservatives, “ EOS BOS When you are in a hole, stop digging.” EOS BOS These guys went out and bought a bigger shovel. EOS BOS Let us start again. EOS BOS The Prime Minister said that a few people in his office were aware of the cheque from Nigel Wright to Mike Duffy. EOS BOS Please tell us how many people in the Prime Minister's Office were aware of the second cheque, the one to pay Mike Duffy's legal expenses. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again I will refer the hon. member to affidavits recently filed in court. EOS BOS However, while I have the floor I will also mention the fact that again today we see that the Canadian economy grew by over 2% annually. EOS BOS That is really good news for the Canadian economy. EOS BOS When they talk about shovelling and talk about digging, of course the opposition members keep digging into this because they know they do not want to talk about the things that Canadians are concerned about: jobs, growth and safe communities. EOS BOS If they talk about that, they know they will be on the wrong side of Canadians. EOS BOS It is this party that is on the right side of Canadians. EOS BOS It is this party that will continue to work to grow the economy and create jobs, even if the opposition gets in the way all the time. EOS BOS Canadians can count on us to focus on the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, only this party and this member would think that a Prime Minister not coming clean with Canadians somehow was not important to Canadians. EOS BOS We believe this to be important to the nation. EOS BOS The issue is Conservative involvement in a cover-up to pay off Mike Duffy and buy his silence. EOS BOS This is just like when the Liberals were mired in the sponsorship scandal. EOS BOS Paul Martin's strategy was to not answer direct questions from the opposition. EOS BOS How did that work out for Paul Martin and the Liberals down the way?Let us try again. EOS BOS Nigel Wright has been interviewed by the RCMP. EOS BOS Can the government tell us, when was the last time the Prime Minister had a conversation with Nigel Wright? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this, coming from a party that actually wanted to have a coalition government with the Liberals. EOS BOS The NDP wanted six seats in the Liberal cabinet. EOS BOS Now, all of a sudden, the Liberals are the worst party ever, but the NDP was ready at one point to set aside what Canadians wanted, when they voted us into office, and to form a coalition government with the Liberals. EOS BOS Wow. EOS BOS It is all over the place. EOS BOS It is trick or treat all day; trick and treat, both of them together. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is actually a very simple question. EOS BOS The parliamentary secretary has to know: when did the Prime Minister last speak to Nigel Wright? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, clearly what is happening here is that they have nothing to talk about. EOS BOS The NDP members do not want to talk about the fact that the Canadian economy continues to grow. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the fact that we have opened Canada to a market of 500 million new consumers. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the fact that we are focused on community safety. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the great work of our Minister of National Defence who is providing our troops with the equipment they need to get the job done. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the fact that our Minister of Natural Resources is opening up new markets for our resources. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the fact that the Minister of Finance is seeing our deficit reduced by an additional $7 billion and we are on track to a balanced budget. EOS BOS They want to talk about the fact that they want to protect these senators. EOS BOS We do not. EOS BOS We are on the side of Canadians. EOS BOS We want them suspended without pay. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has repeatedly changed his story about how many of his employees knew about the scandal. EOS BOS It started out being just Nigel Wright, but now he is saying that several people knew. EOS BOS Exactly how many people in the Prime Minister's Office were aware of the cheque or cheques that bought Mr. Duffy's silence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I refer the hon. member to affidavits that were recently filed in court. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since February the Prime Minister's senior insiders have been up to their necks in a scheme to cover up the wrongdoing and public embarrassment of Mike Duffy. EOS BOS The government has said that paying $90,000 in hush money was wrong but paying $13,000 in legal fees for negotiating that hush money was okay. EOS BOS There would have to have been an itemized invoice for the services rendered by Duffy's lawyer to show in detail what he did to earn the $13,000. EOS BOS When will the government table that itemized invoice? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, hearing this member talk about government accountability is really odd. EOS BOS The member was part of a cabinet that funnelled important government advertising money into the Liberal Party. EOS BOS Apparently, he did not know anything about it and the Liberal prime minister at the time did not know anything about it. EOS BOS Rather, it was all the public works minister, a public works minister who had the time to also cut a cheque for a Liberal cabinet minister to cover the expenses of his son's wedding. EOS BOS The Liberals liked him so much they elevated him from an honourable to an excellency by sending him to Denmark. EOS BOS Give me a break. EOS BOS They have nothing to teach anyone on ethics and accountability. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative cover-up began in February. EOS BOS Along the way it involved Wright, van Hemmen, Woodcock, Perrin, Hamilton, Byrne, LeBreton, Tkachuk, Stewart Olsen, Gerstein, Novak and others. EOS BOS The Prime Minister meets with these people almost every day and somehow he never noticed, they never told him and he never asked about a scheme in their inner sanctum involving potentially illegal conduct. EOS BOS Among these players, who gave the order to sandbag Deloitte's audit and corrupt a Senate proceeding, and is he or she still on the public payroll? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, hearing the Liberals talk about ethics is like watching a snake come out of its skin. EOS BOS The snake will come out looking all shiny and new, but it is really the same dangerous snake it was before. EOS BOS That is what the Liberals are. EOS BOS They are standing in the way of ethics and accountability in the Senate. EOS BOS Their senators need to get out of the way and let the Senate pass this motion so that we can strip these senators of their pay. EOS BOS That is the level of accountability Canadians want. EOS BOS Only the Liberals and the NDP support these senators and are trying to make victims out of these people who took from Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, any delay in the Senate is entirely the responsibility of the Conservative leader in the Senate and the PMO that is pulling his strings. EOS BOS It stands to Mike Duffy's great discredit that he lied to Canadians about the source of the hush money. EOS BOS It is an even greater discredit if someone in the Prime Minister's Office actually counselled Duffy to tell that lie. EOS BOS That is what he said, that the PMO told him to lie on national television. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister make all staff available to testify under oath to contradict Duffy or is Duffy now telling the truth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there go the Liberals supporting Senator Duffy and these disgraced senators. EOS BOS Recently the new Liberal finance critic was on a panel with the Liberal leader and she talked about the fact that she was worried that today's job prospects are not about how smart or educated one is but have more to do with what one's father did. EOS BOS I know she was not talking about me because my dad was a really great hairdresser, he was a great pizza maker and I am not that talented. I wonder who she could be talking about. EOS BOS I will have to ask the Liberal leader who he thinks she was talking about when he makes it back into the House. EOS BOS Who could be— EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for Pierrefonds—Dollard. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday, the Prime Minister said, “...on our side there is one person responsible for this deception, and that person is Mr. Wright... EOS BOS ”.Then, just a few days ago, after months of people asking questions, the Prime Minister finally dropped his flimsy story and admitted that a few people in his office were aware of the scheme. EOS BOS That being the case, why, last Tuesday, did he once again say that Nigel Wright acted alone, even though that theory has long since been debunked? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on February 13, when he was approached by Mike Duffy to try to justify his inappropriate expenses, the Prime Minister told to him to repay those inappropriate expenses that he did not earn. EOS BOS Mr. Duffy went on TV and then said that he made those payments by taking out a loan at the Royal Bank. EOS BOS We subsequently, obviously, found out that it was not true, that Nigel Wright did that. EOS BOS Nigel Wright has taken sole and full responsibility. EOS BOS He knows that what he did was wrong, and he is prepared to accept accountability. EOS BOS We have a motion in the Senate right now, and we hope that the senators will pass the motion that would strip these individuals of their pay, because that is what Canadians want, and that is what the vast majority of this caucus wants. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, here is another inconsistency in the Prime Minister's story. EOS BOS He said that he had received assurances that Mike Duffy would repay the expenses himself. EOS BOS However, on Thursday, he said that it was Mr. Duffy himself who announced on national TV that he had repaid his expenses. EOS BOS When the Prime Minister said that he had received assurances that Mr. Duffy would repay his expenses, who gave him those assurances? EOS BOS Was it Mike Duffy on TV? EOS BOS Was it Mike Duffy during a private meeting? EOS BOS Was it Nigel Wright? EOS BOS Who was it? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Mike Duffy went on TV and told Canadians that he repaid his expenses by taking out a mortgage on his home. EOS BOS I note that the opposition, I do not think, asked any questions about this until May 15, when it was reported, and we all knew, that that was not actually the case. EOS BOS That was wrong. EOS BOS It was wrong for Nigel Wright to have made that payment on his behalf, and it is wrong right now that Mr. Duffy will not accept responsibility for what he has done. EOS BOS We are going to extract that responsibility, hopefully by passing this motion in the Senate, and the Senate can get to the motion and pass it, and we will do what Canadians want: accountability for the senators, nothing less. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to ask again. EOS BOS We still do not have a clear picture of who said what to whom and who did not tell the truth to whom. EOS BOS The Prime Minister seems to be saying he found out how Mike Duffy repaid his expenses when Mr. Duffy went on TV. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister accusing Nigel Wright of lying to him? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, again, Senator Duffy went on TV and told Canadians that he took out a loan on his home and repaid his expenses. EOS BOS We are not talking about the leader of the NDP here, who waited 17 years to talk about the fact that he was offered a bribe and then was not sure if he was or was not. EOS BOS Then, of course, he admitted that yes, he was offered a bribe. EOS BOS Imagine what we could have saved the people of Quebec if only the Leader of the Opposition, 17 years ago, would have told police that he was offered an illegal bribe. EOS BOS That is shameful. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we demand accountability. EOS BOS We have a motion before the Senate right now to do what Canadians want: get accountability from the Senate. EOS BOS The Liberals in the Senate need to get out of the way and let us pass that motion. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we refuse brown envelopes. EOS BOS On the other side, they hand them out. EOS BOS That is the differenceThe Prime Minister is playing innocent—poor thing—when he says that it is unacceptable that Mr. Duffy misled him about the source of his repayment. EOS BOS However, if that is so unacceptable, why was it the staffers in his office who suggested this ridiculous fabrication to Mike Duffy and these lies to journalists? EOS BOS Why? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is coming from a member, who, on Monday, thought it was funny that he made 29 separate donations to a party that wants to destroy Canada. EOS BOS He somehow thinks that is funny. EOS BOS [Translation]On this side of the House there are Conservative members from Quebec. EOS BOS They are proud to be Canadians and proud to be Quebeckers. EOS BOS They work tirelessly towards a stronger Canada and a stronger Quebec. EOS BOS It is too bad that the member does not share the same pride. EOS BOS [English]If he did have that same pride, he would help us build a bigger, better, stronger, safer Canada instead of trying to tear it apart. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to make a confession. EOS BOS I also tell stories to my children in the evening to help them sleep. EOS BOS However, I certainly do not do that in the House of Commons. EOS BOS This weekend in Calgary, the Reform base out west will really be thrilled to see the gang opposite showing the same attitudes and behaviours as the Liberals during the sponsorship scandal. EOS BOS I will try a simple question: did Chris Woodcock say to lie about the source of the $90,000 to Mike Duffy? EOS BOS Did he say that, yes or no? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he is talking about his Liberal partners, of course, who wanted to get into a coalition with them, and maybe get a cabinet seat for himself. EOS BOS I will tell you what is frightening, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS What is frightening is this: he actually wants to separate and destroy Canada. EOS BOS He wants to talk about an issue that has devastated the Quebec economy and has torn apart families in Quebec. EOS BOS No one in Quebec wants to talk about that. EOS BOS They want to talk about building a bigger, better, stronger, safer Canada. EOS BOS They want to talk about jobs and the economy. EOS BOS Only this member continues to harbour the belief that separation is a good thing. EOS BOS That is why he has provided 29 separate donations. EOS BOS That is what is scary. EOS BOS I hope his children do not understand the fact that he wants to separate Canada from Quebec, because that would certainly be scary. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the weekend in Calgary, will there be a panel to provide an historical perspective of a time when the bunch opposite still had principles, perhaps with videos of the good old days when the Conservatives could talk about ethics without making the entire country roar with laughter?Mike Duffy might well be a crook, but at least he is submitting documents, facts. EOS BOS He is putting something out on the table, which the Prime Minister has not done. EOS BOS If the Conservatives want to contradict him, they should follow suit. EOS BOS Will the Conservative publicly release all the emails between Nigel Wright and Mike Duffy? EOS BOS Will they put them out on the table? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am glad he mentions the Calgary convention. I cannot tell the House how excited I am to be in Calgary with the grassroots of this party, whose policies and advice have helped us make Canada the best country in the world in which to live, who have helped shape our policies to help guide us through this second economic downturn. EOS BOS It is the grassroots of this party who have also been instrumental in helping build this country. EOS BOS That is why I am excited to go to Calgary. EOS BOS I am excited to be in Calgary with these grassroots, because they know that building a bigger, better, stronger, safer Canada is better for all of us, unlike that member who continues to try to tear it apart— EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The member for Timmins—James Bay. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been five months since Canadians learned about the secret deal between Mike Duffy and Nigel Wright. EOS BOS We learned in May that there was one cheque. EOS BOS Then in the past week, we learned that there was a second cheque, from Conservative Party donors, to cover off Mike Duffy's legal fees. EOS BOS Does the government know how many cheques Mike Duffy received and how many cheques were handled by the Prime Minister's Office? EOS BOS It should be a simple question to answer. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said on a number of occasions, on occasion, this party does provide legal assistance for the members of its caucus, if it is required. EOS BOS It does not change the fact that what Mike Duffy did in accepting expenses that he did not earn was wrong. EOS BOS It does not change the fact that Nigel Wright, in paying those expenses, was wrong. EOS BOS The Prime Minister stated on a number of occasions that had he known, he would have in no way accepted this particular scheme. EOS BOS Right now, we have a motion in front of the Senate that would give us accountability for these actions. EOS BOS It is only the Liberals and the NDP that are trying to make victims out of these three senators and disgraced former Liberal Senator Mac Harb. EOS BOS We are on the side of Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS That is where we are comfortable, and that is where we will always be. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it was not all that difficult a question. EOS BOS How many cheques were there? EOS BOS Let us try a quote from the Prime Minister when he was taking on Liberal corruption. EOS BOS He said:My difficulty with the prime minister at this point...is that I don't think that he's been...honest on fairly simple questions when there appear to be contradictions. EOS BOS [...] when somebody doesn't answer questions...in a straightforward manner, there may be something else. EOS BOS Let us talk about that “something else”. EOS BOS Will the government tell us when the Prime Minister last spoke to Arthur Hamilton to find out the nature of Mike Duffy's legal fees and whether it was appropriate to use the money of Conservative donors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, talk about flip-flopping all over the place. EOS BOS No wonder my daughters do not like clowns. EOS BOS This is the party that wanted to actually form a coalition with the Liberals. EOS BOS They now call them very corrupt and an awful party, but as long as they give them six cabinet seats, they will be okay with them. Give me a break. EOS BOS This is about Nigel Wright paying off the debts that Mike Duffy did not incur. EOS BOS It is time for some accountability in the Senate. EOS BOS We have made great progress on that. EOS BOS The Liberals in the Senate need to get out of the way so that the senators can pass this motion so that we can get that accountability Canadians want. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Halloween, I am sure his daughters are going to have a wonderful time, and my daughters are wonderful too, but I would never use them to hide behind corruption. EOS BOS Let us find out why they are not being forthright. EOS BOS Is it because the Prime Minister told his base that he would clean up Ottawa, that instead he took the cushy Conservative insiders and gave them lifetime appointments, that he sat on a cover-up in his own office, and that he allowed these Conservative to break all the rules? EOS BOS What happened to that man who promised Canadians that he would make a better country and clean up the corruption of Ottawa? EOS BOS What happened to that man? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will tell members what happened to that man. EOS BOS He has been in this chamber and the head of a government that has created a million new jobs for Canadians. EOS BOS He is opening up new markets and has signed one of the biggest trade deals in Canadian history, opening up a market of 500 million people to Canadian consumers. EOS BOS He is making our communities safer. EOS BOS He is re-equipping our armed forces. EOS BOS He has respect for the Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS He reduced GST from 7% to 6% to 5%. EOS BOS While they talk about the middle class and vote against it constantly, we support the middle class and support accountability. EOS BOS That is what this Prime Minister is all about: the Canadian people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister still refuses to take any responsibility for his senior staff. EOS BOS His senior staff gave $90,000 to Senator Duffy. EOS BOS His personal lawyer in the PMO oversaw that. EOS BOS His PMO staffer, Chris Woodcock, invented the lie about the source of the Duffy funds. EOS BOS In May, the Prime Minister stood by Nigel Wright, and now he throws him violently under the bus. EOS BOS In light of the facts, how can the Prime Minister accept absolutely no personal responsibility for this abuse of the public trust? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that member, sitting in a caucus surrounded by people who owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid leadership debt, could perhaps help us with that form of accountability by working to get them to repay those illegal debts. EOS BOS That would be a good start for the Liberals. EOS BOS Perhaps they could also inform their senators to get out of the way so that we can get real accountability for our senators. EOS BOS What Mike Duffy did was wrong. EOS BOS What Senator Wallin did was wrong. EOS BOS What disgraced Liberal Senator Mac Harb did was wrong, and the Canadian people want accountability. EOS BOS The Liberals in the Senate need to get out of the way so we can get that accountability. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has in his possession a document that Canadians have yet to see that would help answer many questions. EOS BOS Arthur Hamilton's invoice should itemize all of the work he did for the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS We know that he helped the PMO cover up this scandal. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister release that invoice so that we can see the details of the agreement with his office? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said from the outset, we will continue to co-operate any way we are asked. EOS BOS Ultimately, what we are talking about here is the fact that these senators claimed expenses that they were not entitled to. EOS BOS They were not entitled to that. EOS BOS Right now before the Senate there is a motion that would extract accountability from these senators. EOS BOS I ask myself, “ EOS BOS What would Eugene do in this case?” EOS BOS I know what Eugene would do. EOS BOS He would apologize. EOS BOS He would resign, and he would pay it back. EOS BOS It is only the Liberals and the NDP who think it is okay to cheat Canadians and still collect a paycheque. EOS BOS We do not. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has stated for months that no documents existed outlining the cover-up taking place in his own office. EOS BOS We now know that was not true, because Senator Duffy has made public documents and emails directly contradicting the Prime Minister. EOS BOS It is a sad day when Canadians have to learn more from Mike Duffy in eight days than from the Prime Minister in eight months. EOS BOS No wonder nobody believes the Prime Minister anymore. EOS BOS Will the government make public the remaining documents, or will it wait for Senator Duffy to do so? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can tell members what a sad day is. EOS BOS It is a sad day when the Liberals continue to stand up for these disgraced senators. EOS BOS That is what a sad day is. EOS BOS They are now trying to make a victim out of Senator Duffy. EOS BOS Senator Duffy is trying to convince Canadians that somehow he was forced to accept $90,000. EOS BOS He did not want to do it. EOS BOS It was his assistant's fault that he claimed a per diem while he was out in Puerto Vallarta or wherever, perhaps meeting with the former Liberal senator from Puerto Vallarta. EOS BOS Who knows? EOS BOS It was his fault. EOS BOS It was everybody's fault but his, and now the Liberals are standing up for him. EOS BOS That is what is a real disgrace. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is smog of policy misinformation coming from the other side of the House. EOS BOS After travelling to Washington to push the NDP's job-killing policies, the member for Halifax had the gall to stand in the House and ask what we were doing to reduce emissions and protect the environment. EOS BOS The NDP continues to deny its $21 billion carbon tax, despite all evidence to the contrary. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment update us on the progress our government is making? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, under the Liberals, greenhouse gas emissions rose by 30% and under the NDP, I am fairly certain that unemployment and tax rates would follow the same type of curve. EOS BOS Today our government will table the federal sustainable development strategy report that shows our government is getting the job done when it comes to balancing environmental policy with economic growth. EOS BOS Air quality in Canada is among the best in the world. EOS BOS Our Great Lakes are on their way to being restored. EOS BOS Greenhouse gas emissions are being reduced. EOS BOS We are making clear progress on environmental sustainability, while the NDP and Liberals continue to blow hot air. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have told Canadians in one election after another that they would come to Ottawa and change Canadian politics and be more accountable, more democratic and more transparent. EOS BOS Instead, they have undertaken a sustained attack on centuries of parliamentary tradition, the most serious attack, I honestly think, we have seen in the history of our country and Parliament. EOS BOS The procedural guillotine, the use of time allocation and closure motions to shut down debate in this chamber, was designed to be used as an extraordinary mechanism in extraordinary circumstances, not as a routine measure. EOS BOS That is what it has become, a routine measure. EOS BOS (1510)[Translation]There is a word for the abuse of power to change laws and muzzle the opposition: tyranny. EOS BOS Yes, the tyranny of the majority. EOS BOS I do not know if the member is aware that misuse of closure is a radical departure from the traditions of this House and of other British parliamentary systems around the world. EOS BOS I do not know if the Conservatives believe that their majority gives them the right to act without the opposition and without debate in which views differing from their own are expressed. EOS BOS [English]I finish with this question. EOS BOS Will the government House leader commit to the House to cease using this measure? EOS BOS He has used it repeatedly, a record majority of times now. EOS BOS Will he cease using it and stop using the anti-democratic process he has used over 15 times now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by re-extending my invitation to the opposition House leader to actually move forward on some of the most non-controversial bills before the House. EOS BOS For example, Bill C-28, the Financial Literacy Leader Act, will help to promote and enhance the financial literacy of Canadians. EOS BOS I know this is an issue that the NDP has often raised in the past, especially the member for Sudbury. EOS BOS I look forward to hearing a proposal from the NDP on how much debate it would like to see on that non-controversial bill before moving it to committee. EOS BOS What will disappoint Canadians is what we saw this morning when the NDP rejected a responsible work plan based on the views actually expressed by all parties right here in debate last week to pass Bill S-5, the Financial System Review Act, before Canada's banking laws expire in mid-April. EOS BOS Again, the NDP House leader is apparently blocking the will of the members of his own party, who are responsible for the legislation, on how it should be dealt with in the House. EOS BOS [Translation]Nevertheless, we will give the NDP another chance. EOS BOS We have asked for a debate on this bill next Tuesday. EOS BOS I hope that we will be able to move forward then and refer the bill to committee. EOS BOS [English]When we returned to Parliament last month, I laid out our government's plan for a productive, hard-working and orderly House of Commons. EOS BOS We are going to continue in that direction. EOS BOS Unfortunately, we have also seen the NDP lay out its own plans for the House. EOS BOS It wants to force the government to resort to time allocation in every case possible in the hope of running up the score. EOS BOS It wants to be able to quote the number of times the government has been forced to resort to time allocation to get bills advanced in Parliament. EOS BOS For this, it has refused to agree to processing even the most non-controversial bills, or in the case of the copyright bill, one that had only seven hours of debate before we all agreed to send it to committee in the last Parliament. EOS BOS This time, even after 75 speeches on the identical bill, it refuses to let it go to committee for detailed examination. EOS BOS While the NDP hopes that this statistic, the running up of the score that it is forcing, will somehow help it in the next election, what the number actually stands as proof of is the NDP's commitment to paralyze Parliament, to obstruct and delay to the maximum and to refuse to co-operate on even the simplest, most straightforward and broadly supported legislation. EOS BOS [Translation]We demonstrated that yesterday with Bill C-11, An Act to amend the Copyright Act. EOS BOS We had to take action once we realized that a co-operative solution was not viable. EOS BOS Seventy-five speeches later, the end was still not in sight. EOS BOS During the previous session, an identical bill was sent to committee after just seven hours of debate, as I said. EOS BOS Tomorrow, we will have the eighth and final day of debate on second reading of Bill C-11, An Act to amend the Copyright Act, which would protect high-quality jobs in the digital and creative sectors. EOS BOS This bill is important to Canada's economy. EOS BOS Today, we will complete debate on the New Democrats' opposition day motion. EOS BOS (1515)[English]I am pleased to inform the House that on Monday and Wednesday we will deal with third reading of Bill C-19, Ending the Long-gun Registry Act. EOS BOS Next Wednesday night, we will have a momentous vote to end the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all. EOS BOS [Translation]Finally, Mr. Speaker, I can advise that I will be scheduling Friday, February 17, as the day, pursuant to Standing Order 51, on which the House will hold a day of debate taking note of the Standing Orders and the rules of this House and its committees. EOS BOS I also want to say that Thursday, February 16, will be the third allotted day. EOS BOS Canada's economic stability and advantage in these uncertain times depends on political stability and strong leadership. EOS BOS That is why we will continue to manage the country's business in a productive, hard-working and orderly fashion. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. EOS BOS Upon further investigation, the station in La Ronge is open. EOS BOS There was a retirement in March of 2010 and then a rehire in the spring of 2011. EOS BOS That person is in the office as we speak. EOS BOS I would ask the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages to check his facts. EOS </s> BOS It sounds to me like a continuation of debate and not a question of privilege. EOS BOS I am sure the member for Jeanne-Le Ber will have other opportunities to pursue this matter in future question periods perhaps. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Christmas Eve 2016, Nicolas Faubert of Mont-Saint-Hilaire died in a tragic accident. EOS BOS He was sponsoring his spouse, Sophie Thewys, and her son for permanent residence. EOS BOS The application was approved, but because of his tragic death, Sophie was sent back to square one. EOS BOS This appalling lack of compassion is preventing a single mother from grieving properly. EOS BOS I have written authorization, so the government cannot hide behind privacy excuses. EOS BOS Will the government right this injustice and give Sophie permanent resident status? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada is a generous and compassionate country. We know that we must help those in need here at home and around the world. EOS BOS We are always looking for ways to do more for people. EOS BOS I know that the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship is currently taking a close look at this case. EOS BOS I know that everyone wants to ensure the best outcome in this situation, while maintaining the integrity of our robust immigration system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, having voted in favour of the Harper government's Bill C-51, the minister is finally presenting the promised reforms, but they are unfortunately incomplete. EOS BOS The security of Canada information sharing act can have its name changed, but that is only a cosmetic change that does not protect the information shared by national security agencies. EOS BOS Why has the minister not addressed one of the most controversial aspects of the former Bill C-51? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in the election we laid out a very detailed program for how we would deal with Bill C-51, and today we have implemented exactly that. EOS BOS It is contained in Bill C-59, before the House, which is in addition to the committee of parliamentarians, which is in addition to the funding for counter-radicalization, which is in addition to the most extensive consultations in Canadian history. EOS BOS We have listened carefully to Canadians and we have implemented their advice. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the committee of parliamentarians does not have full access; the consultation took nearly two years, while CSIS continued to use these new abusive powers that it has. EOS BOS The promise was to fix a bill as a way to hide from the fact that they endorsed the Conservatives' draconian agenda. EOS BOS The Federal Court ruled a few months ago that it was illegal for CSIS to retain bulk metadata. EOS BOS What we see in Bill C-59 is simply formalizing and legalizing what the court deemed illegal. EOS BOS Could the minister explain where in the consultations he was told by experts and Canadians that it was the right thing to do? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in his judgment last fall, Justice Noël of the Federal Court indicated that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, in his view, was out of date in relation to new technology and other developments over the last 25 years. EOS BOS We have taken his judgment to heart and in fact implemented in this legislation the kind of framework to ensure that the law and the Constitution are properly respected. EOS BOS The difficulty is that Canadians have made it very clear that they do not trust the NDP with their safety and they do not trust the Conservatives with their rights. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' budget implementation bill is a 400-page monstrosity with 450 clauses. EOS BOS Several dozen statutes will be amended, on topics ranging from beekeeping to cable, employment insurance and refugee care. EOS BOS It is a real mixed bag. EOS BOS What is more, a number of measures in the bill are there simply to correct mistakes made in previous omnibus bills. EOS BOS Why is the government insisting yet again on passing a mammoth bill at top speed? EOS BOS What is it trying to hide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's priorities are to create jobs and promote economic growth, and long-term prosperity. EOS BOS The government is taking measures to create jobs. EOS BOS For example, this bill will help create jobs and opportunities in Canada thanks to the new small business tax credit. EOS BOS I ask the opposition members to support this bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the announcement made today by the Minister of Finance, there is still one very troubling aspect of the small business changes, which is this. EOS BOS A married woman in a family business will now have to prove that she receives a dividend from that company. EOS BOS However, for a divorced woman, it is assumed she will receive that dividend from the same company. EOS BOS Therefore, from one feminist to another, how is that fair? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on January 1, we are lowering small business taxes for 100% of small businesses across the country. EOS BOS Three per cent of small businesses of Canada-controlled private corporations use income sprinkling. EOS BOS Of that 3%, many will be able to continue under recently-clarified rules that apply. EOS BOS Those who are trying to use income sprinkling as a way of avoiding paying their fair share of taxes no longer will be able to. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect of this government when we make the tax system fairer, and that is what we are delivering on. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been accused on the other side of not understanding arithmetic, so I think I will help the Prime Minister on this one. EOS BOS Three per cent of small businesses is 45,000 small businesses in this country that, in the next two and a half weeks, will have to understand these rule changes and then implement corporate structure changes to their own businesses in order to be able to be on the right side of the CRA, and then the CRA will test to determine if it is reasonable what they are doing. EOS BOS This does not help anyone in this country. EOS BOS Will the Liberals withdraw these tax changes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on January 1, small businesses will be paying lower taxes, because we are dropping the small business tax rate. EOS BOS For those Canadian-controlled private corporations that do use income sprinkling, they will have the entirety of 2018 to determine how to give out dividends, and then they will have a few more months after that to prepare their taxes. EOS BOS We are giving plenty of time to businesses to ensure that they are able to continue to do things that matter to their businesses. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, it has been clear for the past eight months that the government has big plans: a plan to drive Canadians further into debt, a plan to create deficit after deficit, and a plan to raise Canadians' taxes with a carbon tax. EOS BOS Do the Liberals have a plan to help entrepreneurs create more jobs? EOS BOS No. EOS BOS That is not something they have done in the past eight months. EOS BOS Since this is very likely one of our last days in the House before the summer, can the government explain to us why it has no plan to create wealth and help our entrepreneurs create jobs in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question. I would encourage him to read budget 2016 because the plan we created for Canadians targets growth. EOS BOS We talked about historic investments and infrastructure, including an infrastructure investment of $120 billion over 10 years. EOS BOS We made a plan for innovation that will result in 0.5% growth this year and 1% growth next year, as the parliamentary budget officer confirmed. EOS BOS Our plan will also create 100,000 jobs. EOS BOS That is what a responsible government working for Canadians, the middle class, and Canadian industry looks like. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Poland's defence minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, says that there has been unprecedented activity by Russia's navy and air force in the Baltic Sea region in recent days. EOS BOS He also says that this is evidence of Russia's testing and probing of NATO and that this does not in any way help to build good relations and trust. EOS BOS Given this spike in activity, would the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence please update this House on Canada's contribution to NATO's Ukrainian assurance measures? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Etobicoke Centre for his great support for Ukraine. EOS BOS There has indeed been increased activity in the Baltic Sea region by Russian forces, and our CF-18 pilots continue to witness it first-hand. EOS BOS Yesterday morning, two CF-18 Hornets based in Lithuania were scrambled to respond to non-NATO aircraft off the Baltic coast and intercepted a Russian transport aircraft and a Russian surveillance plane. EOS BOS This time, however, these Russian planes had an escort: four Russian MiG-31 Foxhound fighter jets. EOS BOS Our CF-18s shadowed this Russian formation for approximately an hour. EOS BOS Let there be no mistake: Canada continues to stand with our NATO allies in the face of Russian military aggression. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is something that did appear in the Liberal campaign platform: “set a cap on how much can be claimed through the stock option deduction”. EOS BOS We know a little about that, because it was actually in our platform long before the Liberals discovered it. EOS BOS Tomorrow the Liberals have an opportunity to put the interests of every Canadian above those of wealthy insiders. EOS BOS Last week they actually voted for it and said they were going to do it. EOS BOS Will the Liberals keep their promise to close the stock option loophole, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is interesting how the member opposite talks about doing more for the middle class and less for the wealthiest, because he voted against lowering taxes on the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS If he were serious about helping the middle class, he would make sure that his party stood with us as we lower taxes on the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Finance said that the National Energy Board alone would determine if the west-east pipeline project is safe for Canada's environment and Canadians. EOS BOS In Quebec, we are not counting on the board. EOS BOS We are counting on the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement. EOS BOS That is the organization that is responsible for the environmental and safety assessments of this pipeline. EOS BOS It will take into consideration whether Quebeckers feel the project is acceptable and the repercussions in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance stop aligning himself with pipeline lobbyists and commit to respecting Quebec's environmental process? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the opposition, we will not take a stance before the review is completed. EOS BOS It is up to the National Energy Board to listen to those who are directly affected and have relevant information or knowledge in that area. EOS BOS We base our decisions on science and facts. EOS BOS We have been clear. EOS BOS Projects will be studied only if they are safe for Canadians and will not harm the environment. EOS BOS The Speaker: That is the end of oral questions for today. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Friday the member for Hamilton Centre got up in the House and said that I had lied when I told my dear friend that we would beat him in the Grey Cup. EOS BOS Now that we have beaten him, can he get up and apologize to me, as I did not lie in the House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day for those of us in Hamilton, and an even sadder one for me at this moment. EOS BOS I think we can all reflect back on the Speaker's ruling at that time, when he said that this matter, given that it was in the future, would be resolved over the weekend, and it was, although not necessarily in the way that we in Hamilton would have liked it to have been resolved. EOS BOS It is with a heavy heart but with a sense of national Canadian spirit that I congratulate our competitors on winning the Grey Cup, but make no mistake: “Oskee Wee Wee”. EOS BOS We will be there next year. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, families relied on the children's fitness tax credit to help offset the cost of their kids' sports and fitness programs, but unfortunately the Liberals scrapped it. EOS BOS Now the Prime Minister can use those same tax dollars of families and fly to New York to work out in front of TV cameras, while families are struggling to pay for their kids' sports. EOS BOS Instead of focusing on self-promotion, will the Prime Minister focus on promoting children's fitness and reinstate the child fitness tax credit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in our budget, we have come through with a real commitment to Canadian families that will make a real difference for those families that want to help their children to lead better lives. EOS BOS We will move forward on changing our tax system so the wealthiest will not be advantaged. EOS BOS In fact, we will help those Canadians who need it most. EOS BOS The imposition of the Canada child benefit will help nine out of ten families with children, with $2,300 more on average per year. EOS BOS This will help Canadian families more than anything else, putting more children on sports fields this year. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, millions of parents appreciate the children's fitness tax credit, which helps them to pay for soccer, hockey, or football fees. EOS BOS It is impossible for them to go to New York to play their favourite sport in front of the cameras. EOS BOS Instead of promoting himself, why does the Prime Minister not promote physical activity for young people by keeping the children's fitness tax credit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our budget is clear. EOS BOS The Canada child benefit is much better for the middle class, for families across Canada. EOS BOS With this measure, nine out of 10 families with children will be in a better position this year, with an average of $2,300 more per family. EOS BOS That is much better for families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in March the Department of National Defence sent a letter to the families of fallen soldiers saying they had to pay their own way to the National Day of Honour. EOS BOS When I asked the minister about this in committee, he reversed course. EOS BOS He said that “...we can and will support those individuals”. EOS BOS It turns out he has broken his word. EOS BOS He has now off-loaded the cost to a charity, which is scrambling to raise funds to cover the expense. EOS BOS Why did the minister mislead the committee, the House, and, most importantly, the grieving families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is completely wrong. EOS BOS Only the Liberal Party would be offended by private organizations and individuals wanting to help and support Canada's military and our veterans. EOS BOS I would ask the member to put aside her partisanship and come together with us and honour the sacrifice and courage of the Canadian military on May 9. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Lachine post office, which is in my riding, was one of the first post offices to close as a result of the Conservatives' cuts. EOS BOS When the government announced that there would be no more door-to-door mail delivery, citizens' complaints ballooned. EOS BOS People with reduced mobility, seniors, hundreds of municipalities and all Canadians want this service. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives finally listen to Canadians for once and keep door-to-door mail delivery? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I remind the member that the decision with respect to home delivery is that of Canada Post, an independent arm's length crown corporation. EOS BOS It did so as part of its five-point plan in response to the fact that it delivered 1.2 billion fewer letters in 2013 when compared to 2006. EOS BOS I remind the member that, as it does this, two-thirds of Canadians currently do not have door-to-door delivery. EOS BOS Canada Post, in terms of balancing its finances, has a responsibility to do so. EOS BOS We expect it to do so without being a burden to taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year, one hour after the Canada Post announcement, the Minister of Transport announced in a press release that she agreed with the decision. EOS BOS Thus, it is not true that the corporation is at arm's length. EOS BOS It has been one year since the Conservatives decided to disregard the well-being of Canadians by eliminating home mail delivery. EOS BOS While other countries such as Germany are retooling their postal services by adding banking services, Canada and the Conservatives are attacking a service that Canadians appreciate. EOS BOS One year after this tragic announcement, have the Conservatives finally heard the people's justifiable anger?Do they understand that this has a direct impact on municipalities and people with reduced mobility?Do they understand that Canada Post is profitable?Will they keep home mail delivery? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, this is another message brought to us by CUPW. EOS BOS I am sure it wrote that for the member opposite. EOS BOS Let us be clear. EOS BOS Canada Post has posted three consecutive years of losses. EOS BOS That is primarily because it is delivering a significant amount less mail than it was only years ago, 1.2 billion fewer letters. EOS BOS It has a responsibility under law to operate in a way that is financially sustainable. EOS BOS It has taken action with respect to a five-point plan. EOS BOS We expect it to do that without being a burden to taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has put tens of millions of dollars over a decade into the world-class James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. EOS BOS There is confusion over where $700,000 a year for bare bones operations will come from so that we do not have to give it up to another country this fall. EOS BOS Given budget 2014's recognition of basic research in the new Canada first research excellence fund, would the minister please instruct either the NRC or the CFI to provide operational funding so that Canadian scientists continue to have access to this world-class research? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this question from the hon. EOS BOS member, because it gives me the opportunity to read a few more quotes from Canadian researchers. EOS BOS The chair of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, Amit Chakma, said:The U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities...congratulates the Government of Canada on its 2014 budget and the significant investment of $1.5 billion...for the new Canada First Research Excellence Fund. EOS BOS The president and vice-chancellor of UBC, Stephen Toope, said:I applaud the federal government's decision to spur greater Canadian leadership in global research and innovation.... EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada lags far behind the United States, Europe and Asia when it comes to protecting passengers against the shoddy practices of airline companies. EOS BOS The bill on the air passengers' bill of rights would ensure that Canadians' vacations are not ruined by airline companies in the wrong. EOS BOS Some Conservative members have openly said that they will vote against the air passengers' bill of rights. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives abandoning Canadian travellers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we support a competitive system that serves the interests of passengers. EOS BOS We support a system that gives passengers a choice of airlines so they get better service and a good price at the same time. EOS BOS The NDP is proposing a horrible regulation that will increase costs for passengers and workers in the industry. EOS BOS I would add that the cost of fuel is also significant in this industry. EOS BOS Therefore, a carbon tax will also hurt passengers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, firefighters from across Canada were in Ottawa to discuss three vital issues that are as much about the safety of all Canadians as they are about support for our front-line rescuers. EOS BOS Firefighters are asking for a national public safety officer compensation benefit, amending the National Building Code and providing priority access to vaccines. EOS BOS As firefighters are the first to respond to an emergency and constantly put the well-being of others before their own, will the Minister of Health commit to protecting all Canadians by allowing firefighters priority access to vaccinations in case of pandemic? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I had a great opportunity yesterday to have this discussion with the member who posed the question this afternoon. EOS BOS As I stated yesterday, protecting the health and safety of Canadians who are most at risk must be a priority for any government during a pandemic. EOS BOS The chief public health officers in the provinces and territories, who are the medical experts, recommend vaccine priority according to the nature of the pandemic virus and the risk to the population. EOS BOS As well, the provinces and territories delivering health care are also responsible for the rollout of vaccines in their jurisdictions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is up to the National Assembly and the National Assembly alone to legislate in areas under its jurisdiction. EOS BOS It is not up to Calgary, Toronto, or Ottawa to make the rules for life in Quebec. EOS BOS It is within the rights of the National Assembly to decide that people cannot receive Quebec government services unless their face is uncovered. EOS BOS Is it asking too much of the Minister of Canadian Heritage to respect the Quebec National Assembly's jurisdiction, or does she believe that she is above the law, as she did in reaching an agreement with Netflix? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our position on the issue of diversity has always been clear. EOS BOS We have always maintained that we will defend the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that it is not up to the state to tell someone what they can or cannot wear. EOS BOS We will follow the discussions in the coming days and have a good look at how the law is applied. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a recent study by the OECD found that countries that decided to tax Netflix have had good results. EOS BOS When the Minister of Canadian Heritage says that no country in the world has managed to find the right way to do so, she is talking nonsense. EOS BOS Not only are those alternative facts, but experts agree that all it takes is political will. EOS BOS Does the minister realize that her lack of political will and lack of vision are putting the future of Quebec television at risk? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand the concerns of the cultural sector regarding funding and the protection of francophone culture and Quebec culture. EOS BOS That is why we have reinvested in the Canada Media Fund to support Quebec television. EOS BOS That is also why we have made massive investments in arts and culture, over $2.2 billion to be precise. EOS BOS That is also why, when I presented my vision two weeks ago, I announced some reforms to bring our laws up to date, particularly the Broadcasting Act, to protect our culture in the digital age. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, as you know, the start of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro is just a few weeks away. EOS BOS They are the landmark event of the summer. EOS BOS We are all looking forward to the kick-off and cannot wait to cheer on our athletes, the pride of Canada. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary for Sport and Persons with Disabilities update the House on what our athletes are doing to prepare for the games in Rio? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his question.I can report to the House today that Canada's Olympic and Paralympic athletes are ready to rise to the challenge, with the support of our national sports committees and organizations and our sports partners, as they focus on their final preparations. EOS BOS Canadian Heritage is working with Global Affairs Canada, the Public Health Agency, the RCMP, and officials with the mission in Brazil in order to put the appropriate plans in place for another successful games. EOS BOS I encourage all Canadians to support our athletes, who are a source of inspiration for everyone in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to standing up for small businesses, especially in their dealings with credit card companies. EOS BOS That is why we introduced a code of conduct to ensure that small businesses and other merchants were treated fairly. EOS BOS The same goes for their customers. EOS BOS While the NDP voted against the code, we have continued to work with small businesses and retailers to ensure their voices are heard. EOS BOS Could the Minister of State for Finance tell the House how the code continues to respond to the needs of small businesses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has released new guidelines to better protect small businesses from unfair trading practices when it comes to credit cards for merchant fees. We are committed to making this code flexible and responsive to the needs of small businesses. EOS BOS Let me read a quote from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business as it applauds this move. EOS BOS It states, “ EOS BOS Going forward this is going to be a huge change. EOS BOS The saving for businesses is going to be massive”. EOS BOS However, shamefully, the New Democrats voted against the code. EOS BOS I am not sure what they were thinking when they were opposing small businessmen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Bill C-27 is an attack on stable and secure workplace pensions and it would let employers back away from commitments to workers and pensioners. EOS BOS There have been no consultations, and we are seeing the private sector salivate at the profits associated with the bill, including a CEO who talked about how the changes would directly benefit his company. EOS BOS One might ask which company. EOS BOS Well, it is Morneau Shepell, of course. EOS BOS Speaking of which, will the finance minister admit that his promise to consult was just a sham? EOS BOS Will he immediately withdraw this anti-labour bill that attacks workers' pensions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government wants to help Canadians achieve a safe and dignified retirement. EOS BOS It is key to our plan to help middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS Bill C-27 aims to broaden the scope of retirement saving opportunities available to Canadians. EOS BOS Under our legislation, individuals have a choice. EOS BOS Those who do not consent maintain their benefits in their current form. EOS BOS We are willing to take all the necessary time to give all parties the opportunity to share their suggestions regarding this process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said yesterday that Conservatives are the only ones pushing for a referendum. EOS BOS I guess the Prime Minister must have missed that poll showing 73% of Canadians want a referendum. EOS BOS Canadians understand that any consultation process that takes place as to the form of an electoral reform proposal is different, separate from, and prior to the actual yes or no decision. EOS BOS When a legislative proposal is finally made by the government to change the way we vote, will Canadians get a yes or no decision in a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House said yes to establishing an all-party committee to study the options available for Canadians for their electoral reform, to reach out to those pockets in our communities that are not often reached out to, to hear from those who are often marginalized in the process, and to come back to the House with a proposal. EOS BOS I look forward to the co-operative and collaborative nature that the committee will work in, in the same spirit that it was established, and I look forward to working with the member opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, just imagine. EOS BOS The Prime Minister thinks electoral reform is too complex for Canadians to have a say. EOS BOS Every democratic government in the world uses referendums to make decisions about issues as complex as separating or uniting nations. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister saying that Canadians are less intelligent than citizens of other countries?Will he finally listen to all the analysts, his own Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Canadians and promise to hold a referendum so that all Canadians can have their say? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are smart reasonable people, which is why an overwhelming majority in the last election voted for electoral reform. EOS BOS We are working on ensuring that we continue the conversation that Canadians began to have with us about modernizing our democratic institutions. EOS BOS We look forward to demonstrating to them and to those who have come before us that in this House co-operation is possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister keeps claiming that the electoral reform process is more complex than a yes or no in a referendum. EOS BOS Apparently, the Prime Minister is so arrogant that he thinks Canadians will not understand the choices, or maybe he is so arrogant that he thinks Canadians do not deserve the final say on changes to their electoral system. EOS BOS Either way, it seems that the Prime Minister seems to think that the only opinion that matters is his. EOS BOS Why will the Prime Minister not let Canadians decide this fundamental choice on their democracy through a referendum? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, it is out of a great deal of respect for Canadians and these institutions that our Prime Minister committed to bringing together an all-party committee to reach out to Canadians, and to hear from them what values and what reforms they would like reflected in their democratic institutions. EOS BOS It is in that spirit of respect and co-operation that we will continue this work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister clearly still does not get it. EOS BOS The government does not respect the millions of Canadian voters who would like to have a say on how they elect their representatives to this place, and is limiting that consultation to the few hundred people that show up as hand-picked witnesses at a parliamentary committee. EOS BOS Why does she disagree with the wisdom of 73% of Canadians who believe that this Parliament should observe the long-standing convention in other Westminster parliaments and Canadian provinces of allowing the voters to decide instead of politicians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are counting on the wisdom of Canadians, of indigenous persons, women, those in rural and remote communities, those with— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS I would remind colleagues that most members in all parties are able to sit and listen to the questions and answers without reacting, even when they be provocative or they do not like what they are hearing. EOS BOS Please, let us do that and show respect for this institution. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Democratic Institutions. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are looking forward to within nine days from today all parties bringing forward the names of the individuals they would like represented on this committee so the committee can begin its work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have met more Canadians in the past six months than the Prime Minister has in the past six years. EOS BOS He really needs to get out more. EOS BOS [Translation]The Conservatives know very well that their higher tariffs will reduce competitiveness, kill jobs and hurt Canadian consumers. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister finally do something to help the middle class and cancel his new $330 million tax? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party's position is to oppose tariff reductions for Canadian consumers, while supporting special tariff reductions for Chinese companies. EOS BOS Their policy makes no sense at all. EOS BOS That is why, here on this side of the House, we support tax cuts for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, General Lawson said in an interview that sexual harassment within the Canadian Armed Forces was partly due to, and I quote, “biological wiring”. EOS BOS Obviously that statement is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS What does the Prime Minister intend to do to change this culture of sexual harassment within the Canadian Armed Forces? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I found the general's comments to be completely unacceptable, inappropriate and offensive. EOS BOS Sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are unacceptable in any institution. EOS BOS The general did immediately apologize for his comments. EOS BOS The Canadian Armed Forces and Lieutenant-General Whitecross are in the process of implementing all of the recommendations set out in the Deschamps report. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what the Prime Minister just said will not drastically change the culture that has permeated the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS BOS The question was what he personally intends to do about it. EOS BOS [English]General Lawson's comments are, of course, as wrong as they are a representation of everything that is pervasive in the military. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister himself commit to implementing Justice Deschamps recommendations in order to put an end to this toxic culture within our military with regard to sexual assault and sexual misconduct? EOS BOS That culture is wrong. EOS BOS It has to be changed from the top. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister act? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, I found the general's comments offensive, inappropriate and completely unacceptable. EOS BOS Sexual misconduct, sexual harassment are unacceptable in any institution. EOS BOS We are all very clear on that. EOS BOS There is no excuse for it. EOS BOS The general did immediately apologize for his comments. EOS BOS I would point out that the men and women in the military commissioned the report on this particular issue and gave a series of recommendations. EOS BOS The armed forces and General Whitecross are in the process of implementing those things immediately. EOS BOS We should not do anything that would slur all of the men and women in uniform. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are trying to downplay the Senate expenses scandal, but Senator Wallin's $350,000 in travel expenses would be enough to pay old age security for some 50 Canadians. EOS BOS Of the entire group of unelected and illegitimate senators, she is the one who wastes the most money on travel “other” than between her pseudo-residence and Ottawa. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives continue to defend the $25,000 she took from taxpayers to campaign in 2011?Do they know what they are? EOS BOS They are just a bunch of Liberals. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to talk about elections because we have a bill that provides for elections to select senators. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the NDP is opposed to this plan. EOS BOS At every opportunity, it tries to stop our plan to democratize the Senate. EOS BOS If the NDP is serious about reform, let it support our bill for real Senate reform. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2006, we ended big business and big union political contributions through the Federal Accountability Act. EOS BOS We believe that money for political activities should come from ordinary Canadians who choose to donate, not big corporations, not big unions and not government. EOS BOS That is why our government continued to take action by ending the direct subsidy to political parties. EOS BOS Could the Minister of State for Democratic Reform  update the House on how much money taxpayers are saving through this initiative? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is delivering on its commitment to phase out the $30 million per year taxpayer subsidy of political parties. EOS BOS Today I am happy to report that this year taxpayers will save $8 million as a result of our government's actions. EOS BOS Unfortunately, it is not surprising that the big tax, big government NDP voted to keep this easy subsidy. EOS BOS This disrespect for taxpayers' money is typical of the NDP.Political parties should do their own fundraising and not live off taxpayer-funded handouts. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, as many know, there is an allied veteran of the Norwegian navy in Halifax seeking long-term care. EOS BOS We promised Canadians that we would repair the damaged relationship with our veterans. EOS BOS Can the government assure Nova Scotia members of Parliament and this House that every measure is in place for this veteran and all veterans like him? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, not only do I want to thank the member for Cumberland—Colchester and all Nova Scotia MPs, I also want to thank all members of this House for their concern and advocacy for veterans. EOS BOS I can confirm that Veterans Affairs works with all veterans, including allied veterans, to ensure they get the long-term care they need. EOS BOS Veterans Affairs supports 6,000 veterans in 1,500 facilities right across the country, and we will continue to ensure all veterans get the care they need, regardless of where they live. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, will the Prime Minister support the New Democratic Party motion to keep veterans' service centres open? EOS BOS [English]Failing the personal vote of the Prime Minister, will he at least allow his members of Parliament a free vote as to whether or not we should keep open the service centres for our brave veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Veterans Affairs Canada is constantly looking for ways to improve service delivery to our members, to the vets who need those services. EOS BOS All veterans requiring personal support will continue to be visited by their case managers at their home, and as well we have some 650 service points for veterans in Service Canada offices throughout the land. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, does the Prime Minister realize that from Corner Brook, one of the offices being closed, to St. John's is an eight-hour drive in good weather, that it is not true that there will be home visits for all these veterans, and that it is grossly unacceptable to be shutting down services to our veterans when we have lost eight of them to suicide in the last two months? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we all are very deeply saddened by the suicides, but I think it is patently unfair to connect those unfortunate circumstances to the office closures. EOS BOS We do intend to keep on working on these issues to ensure that, whether veterans need immediate service and to be visited by a caseworker, that continues, along with their opportunity to access a local service centre office very, very close by, where veterans' issues will be dealt with at that point. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he said “very, very close by”; a 16-hour return trip. EOS BOS Veterans in Sydney, Nova Scotia, are holding sit-ins to try to stop the Prime Minister's decision to shut down these offices. EOS BOS One veteran even said: “ EOS BOS We're fighting a war here”. EOS BOS Veterans saying that they feel they are fighting a war with their own government; how did Conservatives let it come to this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is fearmongering at the height of all this rhetoric. EOS BOS The reality is that in the past veterans in need of home care have been served there and will continue to be, at their own homes or elsewhere, their choice. EOS BOS As far as having to travel for regular, ordinary services, that service will be provided in some 650 locations, some of them right in the very building where the office was that is now being closed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is the minister who said not to point fingers at him. EOS BOS It is not a question of fearmongering; it is a question of listening to Canada's veterans. EOS BOS It is the veterans who are speaking; it is not fearmongering. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has repeated time and again this week that “very few” veterans are using these services. EOS BOS If that is indeed the case, why will the Prime Minister not accept to at least meet with those very few veterans to hear their stories? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, at least I know who I am. EOS BOS I have been committed to having an open dialogue with the men and women who serve Canada in uniform, and we have made significant advancements in how veterans are served— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Veterans Affairs has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, veterans across Canada should know that I am deeply committed, as is our government, to meeting with them and listening to their issues no matter where and when that occurs. EOS BOS I have always reached out to veterans and I will continue doing so. EOS
BOS They felt all the love this week, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS [Translation]While the Conservatives are closing veterans' service centres, we also learned that the Department of National Defence is under administrative supervision. EOS BOS Perhaps if they were the slightest bit capable of managing public money, they would not have to cut services to our veterans. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to reiterate the fact that we remain committed not only to working with groups across the land but also to working closely with the Department of National Defence to ensure that we have a coordinated approach and are delivering the kinds of services that either our serving members or those who are veterans will receive. EOS BOS That is typical of what we have been doing and will be continuing to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he should tell that to the 1.3 million Canadians looking for a job. EOS BOS Today Ontario's Privacy Commissioner added her voice to that of the Canadian Bar Association in accusing Conservatives of chipping away at Canadians' charter right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. EOS BOS The commissioner is clear. EOS BOS Conservatives are trying to use new legislation on cyberbullying to push through a host of measures that would “ EOS BOS invade the privacy of every Canadian”.How can Conservatives possibly justify using a bill meant to protect children as political cover to pass vast new powers to spy on honest Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the Leader of the Opposition has just said is not true. EOS BOS What we are doing is in fact passing laws that will enable police and law enforcement to protect children against online predators, to protect children from the type of abuse and humiliation and bullying we saw in the Rehtaeh Parsons case, the Amanda Todd case, and others. EOS BOS When we heard from their parents, interestingly, what those parents said was “ EOS BOS Pass this law. EOS BOS Protect our children. EOS BOS ” That is what our government is doing. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Liberals say that they support net neutrality. EOS BOS With Bill 74, the Government of Quebec wants to censor the Internet. EOS BOS Quebec's department of finance said that the other provinces will follow their example. EOS BOS If that is true, then the federal government must take action before that happens. EOS BOS Will the government defend Canadians' rights or Loto-Québec's monopoly? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the question. EOS BOS The Government of Canada supports the principle of a neutral and open Internet where Canadians can freely innovate, communicate, and consult the content they want in accordance with Canadian laws. EOS BOS We are aware of these laws and are monitoring their enforcement closely. EOS BOS I thank my colleague for asking his question in French. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, government scientists are being muzzled. EOS BOS They have to ask the minister for permission to speak to the media. EOS BOS Media coverage of climate change has decreased by 80%. EOS BOS Is that the government's real target? EOS BOS There are not enough statistics on the impact of the oil sands on greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. EOS BOS If the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers can exchange emails with Environment Canada scientists, why can the scientists not talk to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the assumptions being made in that question are pure nonsense. EOS BOS [English]We have Environment Canada scientists available to talk to the media regularly and we make no apologies for finding more cost-effective ways to protect the environment. EOS BOS We do have a plan to address climate change and mitigation with regard to meeting our Cancun and Copenhagen obligations, as well as adaptation, particularly with regard to the Canadian north. EOS BOS We have a plan, and I am delighted that the commissioner for the environment acknowledges it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, industry has a cozy relationship with government communications as well. EOS BOS Oil lobbyists got government help to explain why oil sands emissions data were left out. “ EOS BOS I appreciate the help on this, an important issue for industry...”, writes one lobbyist in a thank-you note to the Conservatives. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, this is important for all Canadians. EOS BOS When will the government stop muzzling its scientists so that all Canadians can hear from them, not just the Conservatives' oil lobbyist friends? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is prepared, and certainly Environment Canada is prepared, to communicate with all levels of Canadian society, whether it be in industry, whether it be non-governmental organizations, or indeed members of the opposition. EOS BOS If my hon. colleague has any questions that she would like clarified with the department, I invite her to make contact with my office and I will arrange such a briefing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government claims to defend— EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government claims to defend victims and taxpayers. EOS BOS We have heard it all before. EOS BOS However, it is clear that it is turning its back on victims by eliminating the firearms registry. EOS BOS Victims themselves are saying this, and they have the support of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime. EOS BOS But the government does not care about taxpayers either, including Quebeckers who paid their fair share for collecting the data contained in the registry, data requested by Quebec's National Assembly. EOS BOS Why is there so much contempt for the rights of taxpayers in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we made a very clear, very specific campaign commitment to destroy the registry. EOS BOS The registry is made up of data and information. EOS BOS We will be destroying the information because the information is the registry. EOS BOS We will fulfill our campaign promise and will continue to fight crime so that our streets are safer for Canadians. EOS BOS I invite the NDP to join us and vote in favour of these bills. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Jordan's principle was established in response to the death of Jordan River Anderson, a five-year-old member of Norway House First Nation in Manitoba. EOS BOS This principle seeks to resolve jurisdictional disputes so that first nations children can receive the care they need, when the need it. EOS BOS For a renewed nation-to-nation relationship, we must ensure that there is timely access to care in my province of Alberta and across Canada. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Health inform this chamber on the measures she is taking to ensure that our government fully implements Jordan's principle? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Edmonton Centre for this question. EOS BOS Yesterday, our government announced that it is giving $5 million to Alberta's new First Nations Health Consortium for enhanced service coordination for first nations children in that province. EOS BOS According to its president, Tyler White, the consortium will eliminate many of the barriers faced every day by first nations peoples. EOS BOS This initiative together with others shows that our government is fully implementing Jordan's principle. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister of state responsible for postal services was quite the jokester yesterday with his email comment, but he did not deny the possibility that they might reduce mail delivery from five to three days a week. EOS BOS Not to mention all of the post offices that are being shut down. EOS BOS If the rotating strikes by Canada Post employees, who were calling for protection of their pension and better wages, were going to ruin our economy, could the Conservatives explain what will happen to the economy if we permanently reduce postal services? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is committed to quality mail service for all Canadians, no matter where they live. EOS BOS If that member and his party were serious about mail delivery, they would not have blocked our attempts to restore mail delivery in the spring of 2011. EOS BOS Rather than help us, they lined up with their big union bosses and delayed the mail delivery, which had an effect on the economy and actually accelerated clients using other methods, such as email. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Canadians are not buying this Liberal deception about supporting the middle class. EOS BOS Thanks to the failed energy policies of the Wynne Liberals, the Millbrook arena in Cavan Monaghan was recently hit with a monthly hydro bill of over $11,000. EOS BOS The Liberals have cancelled the children's fitness tax credit and have introduced a new carbon tax, making the cost of everything, from renting ice at the arena to fuel to get children to the rink, substantially more expensive. EOS BOS When are the Liberals going to help families instead of burying them in taxes? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I want to give the colleague a lesson in history. EOS BOS During 10 years, the previous government announced in 2007, with great fanfare, its sectorial policy to improve the environment. EOS BOS The Conservatives had 10 years to put it in place. EOS BOS It was announced in 2007. EOS BOS Over 10 years, they implemented two out of the six sectors. EOS BOS That is their terrible record with respect to the environment. EOS BOS The Conservatives have nothing to tell us. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, under our government, CO2 emissions actually went down. EOS BOS Under the failed Liberal policies of the Kathleen Wynne Liberals, life in rural Ontario is becoming more expensive. EOS BOS In fact, high energy costs are especially hard on seniors living on fixed incomes, on farmers, on farm families, and on small businesses. EOS BOS Now the federal Liberals are taking lessons from the failed playbook of the Kathleen Wynne Liberals. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister forcing a carbon tax on rural Canadians who can least afford it? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I might want to explain why emissions went down under the previous Conservative government. EOS BOS It was nothing to do with the Conservatives. EOS BOS It was because the Liberal government in Ontario closed coal-fired plants and also because the economy was not doing well. EOS BOS We understand we need to put a price on what we do not want, which is pollution, and foster what we do want, which is clean innovation and jobs. EOS BOS That is why, unlike the previous government, we will be doing that. EOS BOS We will be reducing pollution, reducing emissions, and growing our economy. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, as we speak, more and more people in my riding are losing their homes because of the current Liberal economy. EOS BOS Now the charitable agencies providing support for these individuals and families have to cut programs as a direct result of the Prime Minister's ill-conceived carbon tax scheme. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister admit that by charging a carbon tax on charities, he is actually taxing the most vulnerable? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I would hope the member opposite would understand that polluting is not free, that we want to leave a cleaner future to our kids, that we want to grow our economy, and that we want to create good jobs, so we want to foster innovation. EOS BOS That is why we are working with the provinces and territories, developing a plan that will reduce emissions and will produce a more sustainable world for our kids and grandkids, because they deserve that. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, southeast Saskatchewan is in the midst of a jobs crisis and thousands of my constituents are out of work. EOS BOS The Liberals are making things worse by forcing a carbon tax on families who are already struggling to put food on the table. EOS BOS A carbon tax will increase costs for our farmers and ranchers. EOS BOS Middle-class Canadians will have to pay significantly more now just to keep operating. EOS BOS Why will the Liberals not stand up for hard-working Canadians and abandon their foolish carbon tax? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, we always stand up for hard-working Canadians. EOS BOS That is why we reduced taxes for middle-class Canadians and raised them on the 1%. EOS BOS That is why we introduced the Canada child benefit, where nine out of 10 families will get more for their children. EOS BOS We will also take action on the environment because it actually makes economic sense. EOS BOS We are moving forward for a cleaner future for our kids. EOS BOS We will support the middle class. EOS BOS We will create good jobs, because that is what Canadians expect us to do. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the government is boasting about spending millions of dollars on fighting tax evasion. EOS BOS However, not a cent is going toward dealing with the crux of the problem. EOS BOS Most of the money being diverted to tax havens is from banks and multinationals. EOS BOS We are talking about $55 billion in unpaid taxes in five years, and there is nothing illegal about it because the regulations were quietly changed without the members here being consulted. EOS BOS Why does the government keep avoiding the subject? EOS BOS Why does it never do anything about it? EOS BOS Is it because it is the lackey of Bay Street or because this scheme benefits some of the government's members and associates? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I would remind my colleague that rhetoric will only get a person so far before action is needed. EOS BOS The thing we have done in this country is invest $44 million in the Canada Revenue Agency to do three things: provide tools, technology, and teams to deal with tax evasion in Canada. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are going to keep doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government promised to fix the diafiltered milk problem, but it is taking its sweet time, and farmers are paying the price. EOS BOS The fact is, the government does not want to upset the Americans. EOS BOS Sooner or later, the Liberals will have to pick a side: either they defend supply management and take a stand, or they let the United States tell them what to do. EOS BOS Why is the Liberal government protecting American farmers instead of Canadian farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my hon. colleague's question and concern. EOS BOS That is why we are working to find a sustainable solution for this important issue. EOS BOS In the last month I have met with dairy farmers and processors right across the country. EOS BOS With the information we have received, we will be able to make decisions to find a long-term, sustainable solution for the dairy industry in our country. EOS BOS This government supports supply management and always has. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the government is failing to protect supply management and Canadian dairy farmers. EOS BOS Canada has rules on diafiltered milk, but the government is not applying them, and that is sad. EOS BOS Every day Canadian farmers lose money and American farmers get more money. EOS BOS The Liberals have broken their promise to fix this problem. EOS BOS Instead of solutions, all we get is consultation and farmers are losing money. EOS BOS In other words, delay, and we are wasting time. EOS BOS Farmers do not need more consultation. EOS BOS They are done. EOS BOS The time is up. EOS BOS The government needs to act. EOS BOS When will the government finally stand up on these trade issues and defend Canadian dairy farmers? EOS </s> BOS Again, Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated to my hon. colleague who has a great concern for this issue, EOS BOS I have met with dairy farmers, processors and Canadians. EOS BOS They understand that this government fully supports supply management. EOS BOS Even if there are some members of the opposition who do not support supply management, we as a government will find a long-term, sustainable solution so we have a strong dairy industry in our country under the supply management system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the $687 million in cuts to public safety are having a serious impact on Canadians' safety. EOS BOS The Conservative government is getting ready to abolish the intensive supervision program for offenders at high risk of reoffending. EOS BOS We are talking about preventing sex offenders, bikers and mobsters from being released back into society without strict supervision. EOS BOS The program is to come to an end on December 31, which is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS This is a program that has proven to be very effective. EOS BOS Will the minister recognize his mistake and reconsider his decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it would have been nice to have the NDP's support when we increased police resources by one-third in consecutive budgets. EOS BOS We did the same for the Canada Border Services Agency and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. EOS BOS We have increased the number of Canada Border Services Agency officers by nearly 26%.The Conservatives are eager to get a Christmas present from the NDP and have them support us when the time comes to invest in improving Canadians' safety. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives keep bringing in their ideological measures and are undermining the employment insurance system. EOS BOS Even though 50% of unemployed workers are not eligible for benefits, the Conservatives keep adding restrictions. EOS BOS For example, workers are forced to accept lower-paying jobs further away from home, there are quotas to cut $40,000 a month, pregnant women could end up disqualified, and now the work-sharing program is becoming stricter. EOS BOS These are the kinds of tricks the Conservatives are using to make unemployed workers pay off the deficit. EOS BOS How can the minister claim day after day that workers will still benefit from employment insurance while she is in the process of dismantling the whole program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not true at all. EOS BOS Here are the facts. EOS BOS We want to help people find jobs in their region and in their area of expertise. EOS BOS This will be better for workers, their families and their communities. EOS BOS If there is no position available in their region and in their area of expertise, employment insurance will be there, as always. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, on Wednesday we learned that Canada is the country that sells the most arms to the Middle East. EOS BOS Today, we learned that four Canadian financial institutions invested $565 million in companies that manufacture cluster bombs, even though their use is prohibited by a United Nations treaty ratified by Canada. EOS BOS Since the Minister of Foreign Affairs is always a stickler for rules, will he speak out against this situation instead of continuing to make Canada look like a banana republic? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, Canada is very strong and very determined to ensure that these cluster munitions are well regulated by international law, and that applies to Canada as well. EOS BOS As always, that is what we will do with the utmost determination. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, prairie grain farmers have some of the longest hauls in the world to get their product to market, so when the cost of transport increases, farmers immediately feel the pinch. EOS BOS The carbon tax could be renamed “the farm tax” for the overwhelmingly negative impact it will have on our producers. EOS BOS Does the minister understand the impact this new tax will have on agriculture? EOS BOS Has she met a prairie farmer who supports this new tax? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very pleased that we worked with the provinces and territories so that we could bring in a carbon pricing plan that works for Canadians. EOS BOS We are working with provinces and territories. EOS BOS Our government is committed to returning all the revenues to the provinces and territories and it is up to them to determine how to address the situation in their provinces. EOS BOS They can make it revenue-neutral and return the revenues to farmers and to different groups. EOS BOS We believe it is very important that we move forward, that we tackle climate change, and that we position ourselves for the future clean economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government likes to deride the Conservatives for their failed action on climate change and Canada's melting Arctic. EOS BOS How then do the Liberals defend that it took a private petition just to get the government to finally provide just enough dollars to keep the lights on for one year for our renowned PEARL project? EOS BOS The government is granting a mere $1 million to a climate program that was once given $22 million overall by the Conservatives. EOS BOS Will the government respect calls by our nation's leading scientists and recommit long-term support for this critical climate change research? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government understands that the Arctic matters more than ever before because of climate change. EOS BOS That is why yesterday, along with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, I announced $1.6 million to continue operations and research at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory. EOS BOS It is one of Canada's most remote scientific stations, located on Ellesmere Island, and researchers there monitor the changes in the atmosphere, climate change, ozone, and the environment. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the National Energy Board has launched its study of the energy east pipeline. EOS BOS It seems that it will be in English only because TransCanada is still refusing to translate its documents into French. EOS BOS TransCanada wants to force a pipeline on Quebeckers, and the company has the arrogance to ensure that the study will not be conducted in French. EOS BOS Today, the board officially approved TransCanada's contempt for Quebeckers. EOS BOS Will the government rein in the board? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, we made it clear to TransCanada that it must ensure that documents pertaining to the energy east project are translated. EOS BOS As things stand, I understand that the 32,000 pages of English documents have for the most part been translated, and we have made a point of ensuring that this translation will be completed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing reports from New Brunswick about a legal crisis in its family court system. EOS BOS It is all because of the judicial delays in the court system because the Liberals have not even put together a committee to advise them on judicial appointments in New Brunswick. EOS BOS Because of this, families that are desperate for relief are getting none, and Canadians are further losing confidence in our criminal justice system. EOS BOS What is the problem with the Liberals? EOS BOS Why do they not get on with making these judicial appointments? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am committed to ensuring that Canadians maintain their confidence in the criminal justice system. EOS BOS We are taking many measures to ensure this confidence is upheld, including putting in place an open and transparent judicial appointment process and reconstituting the judicial advisory committees. EOS BOS I look forward to continuing to add to the 67 judicial appointments I have made across the country in the superior courts. EOS BOS I look forward to constituting the remaining judicial advisory committees and making further judicial appointments in the very near future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have not even appointed a committee to advise them on judicial appointments. EOS BOS I know this is very difficult for the Liberals, so let me make this suggestion. EOS BOS If they are unable to do this, why do they not put us and the NDP in charge of putting together a committee and we will make recommendations so the minister can get the job done. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very confident in the process that we put in place for judicial appointments and for constituting the judicial advisory committees.
              I have appointed 67 substantive, meritorious, judicial appointments across the country. EOS BOS I look forward to continuing to make more appointments to fill the outstanding vacancies. EOS BOS I assure the hon. EOS BOS member across the aisle that we will be constituting the remaining judicial advisory committees. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have admitted that there has been no progress in the fight against the underground economy in the past five years. EOS BOS What are they proposing? EOS BOS A committee with no targets. EOS BOS What is more, for the past two years, they have been blocking requests from the Parliamentary Budget Officer to determine how many billions of dollars are hidden in tax havens, when every other country in the G7 has already done those calculations. EOS BOS Does anyone in the Conservative government care about tax evasion? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to say that just a few weeks ago in Toronto I launched a ministerial advisory committee on the underground economy to highlight all of our efforts that have been extremely successful in that area and our enhanced approach to the underground economy, which I also tabled in this House. EOS BOS We are taking that issue very seriously. EOS BOS As far as the PBO is concerned, we are working with the PBO. EOS BOS There is an issue as to how much we can share with him. EOS BOS We are working on it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today during question period, I was referring to Senator Wallin, but I said “ EOS BOS William”. EOS BOS I would like to make a correction and say that I was speaking about Senator Wallin. EOS </s> BOS I would like to thank the member for his comment. EOS BOS It is not a point of order, but I am certain that the House appreciates the member's clarification. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have a solution to suggest to the government to help the dairy industry: enforce the law. EOS BOS Dominique Anglade, the Quebec minister for economy, science and innovation, has been asking the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount not to hurt the Quebec economy with his bill, EOS BOS Bill C-10.Would the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount be kind enough to listen to the Quebec government and give up on his ridiculous plan to let Air Canada off the hook retroactively? EOS BOS Will he show some respect for the Quebec economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I think the minister did not know that we had introduced time allocation yesterday at second reading of the bill, specifically because the NDP tried to kill the bill using an amendment last Friday. EOS BOS The good news is that several steps remain in the parliamentary process. EOS BOS The bill will go to committee, where we will hear from witnesses. EOS BOS Then comes the report stage and third reading. EOS BOS After that, the Senate repeats the entire process. EOS BOS There are many steps left in the process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the 2016 census figures show a worrisome trend in eastern Quebec. EOS BOS While the population of Canada increased by 5% over the past five years, the population of the Lower St. Lawrence region and the Gaspé dropped by 1.3% and 4%, respectively. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development commit to scrapping the disastrous policies that prevent our businesses from keeping jobs in the region, or would he rather see our young people continue to move to large urban centres? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government continues to focus on Quebec's economic development in order to create good jobs. EOS BOS Our government has taken measures to help Quebec. EOS BOS For example, since 2015, Canada Economic Development has invested over $406 million in Quebec and supported the development of over 10,500 businesses and organizations. EOS BOS We are going to continue to work hard for Quebeckers and all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are going to take him at his word, but we will see what their word is worth. EOS BOS The Minister of National Revenue is well aware that we have a major problem with KPMG's super rich clients. EOS BOS [English]While KPMG helped super rich clients dodge their taxes with an illegal offshore tax scam, they were wined and dined with CRA officials and got an amnesty deal for the tax cheats with no penalties. EOS BOS It is a very simple question, very much like the question on Air Canada. EOS BOS Why does the Liberal government believe that wealthy tax evaders and their accountants should be above the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government firmly believes that all Canadians need to pay their fair share. EOS BOS The CRA is currently investigating the taxpayers identified in the KPMG schemes. EOS BOS This matter is before the courts, so I would caution my colleague. EOS BOS I want to reassure all Canadians that no one can shirk their obligations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government House leader has found himself a new part-time job as the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, but the rules from the Ethics Commissioner leave him unable to properly manage a number of important files in the department. EOS BOS We would like to know if Irving shipyards has completed the warranty work on the mid-shore patrol ships to the satisfaction of the Canadian Coast Guard? EOS BOS Wait a minute, the minister's conflict will not let him answer that question. EOS BOS Could someone else on that side stand and answer it for us. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will give the member a bit of an education on the work that is actually being done in Halifax. EOS BOS It is not working on Coast Guard ships; it is working on the combat ships. EOS BOS All of the Coast Guard work is being done by Seaspan in Vancouver, so there is no conflict of interest on behalf of my hon. colleague. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign, the Liberals promised a wonderful infrastructure bank through which municipalities could borrow money at the federal government rate. EOS BOS Wow. EOS BOS However, once the Liberals took office, they changed the way the infrastructure bank will operate. EOS BOS Ottawa is now going to allow its friends on Bay Street to borrow at the government rate to help them get their hands on Quebec's municipal infrastructure, without having to answer to the Auditor General. EOS BOS Does the government realize that it is doing exactly the opposite of what it promised with its infrastructure privatization bank? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we all know that investing in infrastructure helps us grow our economy and creates opportunities. EOS BOS We are doubling our investments to $180 billion over the next 10 to 12 years. EOS BOS We will be investing in Canadian communities from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS The infrastructure bank will further mobilize private capital to build more infrastructure that is required by our Canadian communities EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one of the Prime Minister's first actions was to pull our CF-18s from the fight against ISIS and the genocide being waged against the Yazidis and other minorities. EOS BOS Now the Liberals claim a so-called urgent need to replace jets they do not even want to use. EOS BOS What could be more urgent than protecting vulnerable people from the atrocities of genocide? EOS BOS If the Prime Minister will not even use our fighter jets to destroy and degrade ISIS, what exactly is he going to use them for? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to supporting the mission in Iraq and Syria. EOS BOS Our troops on the training and advising are doing wonderful work. EOS BOS I recently got a briefing from the counter-ISIL mission. EOS BOS Progress is being made. EOS BOS I am very proud of the work our men and women are actually doing on behalf of Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal record under the decade of darkness is clear: they refused to buy any new jets; our troops had to beg for rides, because the Liberals refused to buy any new heavy-lift airplanes; and they sent our troops into the dessert with green uniforms. EOS BOS It was our Conservative government that put an end to the decade of darkness. EOS BOS Every time we bought new equipment, the Liberals opposed it. EOS BOS Now they are again choosing politics over buying the best equipment for our troops. EOS BOS With that kind of record, why would anyone believe them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, it was the previous government that cut over $3 billion from the budget. EOS BOS Our government is committed to making sure that we purchase the right equipment for our troops, and that is exactly what we are going to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign the Prime Minister promised a transparent procurement process for the fighter jets. EOS BOS It seems that the dice are loaded and the deal is sealed. EOS BOS How can the 40 Quebec MPs be okay with jeopardizing aerospace jobs in the greater Montreal area?Can the Prime Minister guarantee that there will be a bidding process and that these 40 MPs will stand up for the aerospace industry and Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in terms of the replacement of our fighter jets, we are committed to replacing our jet fighters, and we will do so. EOS BOS No decision has been made at this time. EOS BOS However, we are committed to making sure that we get this right EOS BOS . I will make sure that we do a thorough analysis of this. EOS BOS When a full analysis is done, we will make an appropriate announcement in this House and to Canadians. EOS
BOS I will refer to the comments of the Prime Minister on the F-35s. EOS BOS [Translation]Yesterday, the Prime Minister expressed doubts about the capabilities of the F-35 fighter jet. EOS BOS There are already 185 of these jets in service. EOS BOS Eleven allies, including the United States, Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy, have already decided to continue investing in this program. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister explain why allied countries, except for Canada, are buying this aircraft? EOS BOS Is he questioning the judgment of our allies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, just so the member fully knows, it has interim operability right now. EOS BOS It is not at full operational capability, but we are committed to replacing our fighters. EOS BOS We are going through a thorough process. EOS BOS I will make sure that my officials and I take the time to make sure that we get this right. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when we can relate to the news, when it talks about who we are and what is happening in our communities, that makes for an interesting newscast. EOS BOS Today we heard that regional newscasts will be cut in half. EOS BOS In the Saguenay, Rimouski, Fredericton and Calgary, newscasts will be cut from one hour to 30 minutes. EOS BOS The government is slowly killing our public broadcaster, literally. EOS BOS We are talking about CBC/Radio-Canada's mandate here. EOS BOS How can the minister stand by while the regions lose half of their regional newscasts? EOS BOS Why is she treating us like second-class citizens? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is simply not the case. EOS BOS The CBC is solely responsible for its day-to-day operations, including decisions with respect to programming and with respect to human resource management. EOS BOS Our government respects the CBC's independence as an arm's-length crown corporation. EOS BOS It would be nice to hear, before Christmas, the NDP agree with us on that point. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government committed to taking actions to ensure that Canadians are not paying higher prices simply because of where they live. EOS BOS The unexplained and often significant price gap between Canadian and U.S. prices for the same products is a frustrating reality for Canadian consumers. EOS BOS These price differences are real, and they hurt the bottom line and pockets of Canadian consumers. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry please update the House on the action that our government has taken to tackle this very real problem? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Provencher for the great question. EOS BOS Our government believes that hard-working Canadians and their families should not be charged higher prices than Americans simply because of where they live. EOS BOS That is why we tabled the price transparency act, which would give Canada's Commissioner of Competition the power to investigate price discrimination and expose it. EOS BOS The intentional manipulation of prices on identical goods for sale in Canada and the U.S. places an unfair burden on Canadians and is simply wrong. EOS BOS This government will continue to and will always stand up for the interests of Canadian consumers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to the report from the former ethics commissioner, both of the Prime Minister's family vacations were solicited by the Prime Minister himself through email exchanges with the Aga Khan's family. EOS BOS This is a blatant conflict of interest. EOS BOS The Prime Minister and his family asked for a benefit from individuals who had dealings with the Government of Canada. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister pay back this illegal expense? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the previous commissioner, both in her report and in her testimony at committee, answered many questions related to her report. EOS BOS We accept her findings and we respect her work. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we respect the work of all officers of Parliament. EOS BOS Unlike the opposition, we take the recommendations of all senior officials seriously and we work with them to ensure that we follow their recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is very good at spending other people's money, taking illegal vacations sought by his own family at the expense of Canadian taxpayers, without a shred of remorse. EOS BOS According to the former ethics commissioner's report, the only thing that the Prime Minister finds exceptional is himself. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister do the right thing and repay the $215,000 he took from Canadian taxpayers for his illegal trip? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times, the Prime Minister took responsibility and accepted the recommendations as soon as the report was tabled. EOS BOS The former commissioner found that these costs were incurred as part of the Prime Minister's duties. EOS BOS The member must not be hearing my answer because he continues to ask the same question. EOS BOS We have answered this question. EOS BOS We are here to work for Canadians and to respond to the challenges they are facing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister requested and took a trip from someone who had business with the government, a clear conflict of interest, and the Ethics Commissioner has confirmed he broke the law. EOS BOS We teach our children that if they take something that does not belong to them, they give it back. EOS BOS The Prime Minister seems to think there is one set of rules for him and another for everyone else. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister take responsibility for his illegal actions and pay the Canadian taxpayers back? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to once again remind the House and Canadians that immediately following the report being submitted, the Prime Minister accepted responsibility and he accepted the findings. I have answered that question on numerous occasions. EOS BOS While the Conservatives will continue to focus on the Prime Minister and this government, this government and the Prime Minister will continue to focus on Canadians. EOS BOS That is exactly why the Prime Minister has been available at public town halls across the country. EOS BOS That is exactly why we are listening and engaging with Canadians. EOS BOS Canadians have created 422,000 jobs in 2017, jobs for Canadians by Canadians. EOS BOS Our plan is working, and that is exactly why the Conservatives do not want to talk about the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister broke the law. EOS BOS In doing so, Canadian taxpayers paid more than $200,000 for his illegal behaviour. EOS BOS Meanwhile, the Prime Minister recently told a veteran in Edmonton that he was fighting veterans in court because they were asking for too much. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has no problem spending money, but only money on himself and his friends. EOS BOS The taxpayers should not be on the hook for the $200,000 the Prime Minister used for his illegal holiday. EOS BOS When will he pay it back? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have answered this question on numerous occasions, but I welcome the opportunity to answer it once again. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has accepted responsibility and he has accepted the findings. EOS BOS More so, the Prime Minister has taken the recommendations, including putting a screen in place. EOS BOS The Prime Minister will continue to work with the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to ensure that future family vacations and personal vacations are cleared ahead of time. EOS BOS The former commissioner also acknowledged that these costs were incurred as part of the role of the Prime Minister, which was the case for former prime ministers as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, newly elected National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde vowed yesterday to keep pushing for a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. EOS BOS Earlier this week, Canada witnessed the courage and eloquence of Rinelle Harper as she added her voice to the calls for an inquiry. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister get on the right side of history and immediately call a national public inquiry so that we can put an end to this ongoing national tragedy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, we know that different victims have different views, and we respect the views of all of these victims. EOS BOS What happened to Rinelle Harper was appalling and a horrific crime. EOS BOS Our thoughts and prayers are with her as well as with her family. EOS BOS Thanks to her family's brave decision to move forward and work with police, we have apprehended the attackers, which is extremely important. EOS BOS Our government is very focused on making sure that victims are supported and that those who commit these crimes are apprehended and put behind bars. EOS BOS We have moved forward with the victims bill of rights, as well as a number of other initiatives. EOS BOS This government is focused on doing the right actions, unlike the opposition. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Public Works and Government Services Canada is responsible for the Van Horne bridge that joins Quebec and New Brunswick. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the bridge's sidewalks are snow covered and the minister forgot to negotiate snow removal. EOS BOS Winter is here. EOS BOS Yesterday, another 40 centimetres of snow fell in the Gaspé, and the communities of Listuguj, Pointe-à-la-Croix and Campbellton feel abandoned. EOS BOS Will the government make sure that the sidewalks are passable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, public works is responsible for most of the properties, and the management of those buildings is usually subcontracted. EOS BOS I am not familiar with the case that the member is discussing, but I would be happy to get back to him about it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Liberals were elected on a promise to make it easier for Canadians to find an affordable home. EOS BOS However, with housing prices up 30% in Toronto since 2014, and 37% in greater Vancouver in the last year alone, what has the government done?The Minister of Finance announced a study, and made it harder for middle-class Canadians to get a mortgage. EOS BOS We do not need another study to prove that water is wet, and the CMHC changes target the wrong buyers. EOS BOS This is a crisis. EOS BOS Where is the real action from the government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we recognize the importance of housing to Canadians. EOS BOS We recognize the very real challenge of people in Vancouver and Toronto as the housing market is active. EOS BOS Upon coming into office, we immediately took a look at measures on which we could move forward. EOS BOS We did so in December by moving some rules around down payments for expensive homes. EOS BOS We are doing a deep dive to look at all evidence around the issues that are impacting our housing market so as we make decisions we can make them with evidence to keep this market strong for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, workers at the St. John's airport have been on strike for almost six months. EOS BOS They just won their case at the labour board, proving they are bargaining in good faith. EOS BOS Now they want their employer back at the bargaining table. EOS BOS With the Minister of Labour attending a management luncheon in St. John's today, will she interfere in yet another labour dispute by crossing a picket line at the St. John's airport or will she do the responsible thing and respect this legal strike at this critical time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, both I and the minister have been disappointed that we have not found an opportunity for these two parties to come together. The minister continues to monitor the circumstances and the federal mediator remains involved in assisting both parties in coming to a reasonable solution. EOS BOS We encourage both parties to work together to come to an accommodation in the best interests of Canadians and the Canadian economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, three months after the Emerson report on the aerospace industry was released, the Conservatives are still sitting on their hands. EOS BOS Even though the industry is losing steam in Canada, the Conservatives are doing nothing to create a long-term strategy. EOS BOS The fact is that the aerospace industry represents over 150,000 direct and indirect jobs. EOS BOS It has internationally recognized expertise and is a source of pride for our country. EOS BOS The next budget is approaching. EOS BOS What concrete measures will the Minister of Industry be proposing to comply with the recommendations in the Emerson report and support the aerospace industry? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be more wrong. EOS BOS The reason we commissioned a report by Mr. Emerson was precisely to ensure that Canada could position itself and remain a world leader. EOS BOS Canada ranks fifth among the major aerospace manufacturers. EOS BOS Canada has a favourable tax environment and good support programs, such as SADI.I urge the NDP, instead, to start working with us and abandon its absurd ideas, like the idea of a $21.5 billion carbon tax. EOS BOS That carbon tax would kill the aerospace industry; it would kill the manufacturing sector in general, and would have serious repercussions for Canadian families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of International Trade claims that her Hollywood adventure was a trip to promote Canada and meet with trading partners, but we know— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS Let us have a little quiet. EOS BOS It is hard to hear the member's question. EOS BOS I know you all want to listen to the member's question. EOS
BOS It was not me. EOS </s> BOS Apparently it was not the member for Cape Breton—Canso, he tells me. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is funny: on that side the squeaky wheel seems to be getting the grease today. EOS BOS We know the minister was originally scheduled to appear on a U.S. TV program in October, but she rescheduled her appearance to November after she was sworn into cabinet. EOS BOS The minister wants Canadians to believe that she was there to promote Canada, but Canadians are not buying her story, even at a cost of $20,000. EOS BOS The real reason she was there was to promote herself. EOS BOS If she was really there for government business, why did Time Warner book her stay? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again the Conservatives are trying to create a story where there is none. EOS BOS Since the members opposite continue to be so interested in this non-topic, let me remind them that it was their own leader who left taxpayers on the hook for a bill for $50,000 to hire a consultant to try to secure American media interviews. EOS BOS The Conservatives' accusations about the expenses are false. EOS BOS All the rules were followed. EOS BOS The details were publicly posted months ago. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, several times this week, the Minister of International Trade or her parliamentary secretary have risen in this place and told us that it was her department, and her department alone, that handled all of the arrangements for her fun-in-the-sun vanity trip to California. EOS BOS However, documents indicate that it was Time Warner that booked the five-star Beverly Hills hotel rooms for her and her staffer. EOS BOS Something does not add up here. EOS BOS The question is simple. EOS BOS Why should Canadians be paying for her vanity trip to Hollywood? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again the Conservatives are trying to create a story where there is none. EOS BOS Unlike previous Conservatives, the Minister of International Trade has a justly earned international reputation as a journalist and finance writer. EOS BOS In California, she appeared in the media with U.S. Senator Angus King of Maine and California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. EOS BOS There, she proudly defended Canada's leadership on the Syrian refugee crisis. EOS BOS The Conservatives should learn from colleagues like their former Prime Minister that even they sometimes need to appear in the media. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the Minister of International Trade about her taxpayer-funded trip to LA to appear on the HBO show, Real Time with Bill Maher. EOS BOS The parliamentary secretary claimed the purpose of the trip was to promote Canadian interests with one of our most important trading jurisdictions. EOS BOS Yet, the minister did not even mention trade or make any reference to Canada's interests during her appearance on the show. EOS BOS The minister's Hollywood meeting had nothing to do with her portfolio or government business. EOS BOS Why did Canadian taxpayers pick up the tab? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our Minister of International Trade earned an international reputation as a global thought leader on economic and social issues well before she entered politics. EOS BOS That is why she was given the opportunity to appear before millions of Americans, millions of viewers, on these high-profile panels. EOS BOS It is good for Canada to have a trade minister with that kind of international stature. EOS BOS She should be celebrated for the work she is doing in defending Canadian values and defending Canadian interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, yelling raises Liberals to their feet. EOS BOS Yesterday, I asked the President of the Treasury Board why he and other ministers were violating rules obligating them to post their travel expenses by March 31. EOS BOS Then about an hour later, some of his expenses magically appeared online. EOS BOS A few ministers are still missing, however. EOS BOS When can we expect the rest of the Liberal ministers to obey the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Liberals have led the charge on openness, transparency, and proactive disclosure. EOS BOS In fact, it was a Liberal prime minister, Paul Martin, whose government was the first to proactively disclose cabinet ministers' expenses. EOS BOS It was a Liberal leader, our Prime Minister, in opposition, who led the charge, being the first party in the House of Commons to proactively disclose members of Parliament's expenses. EOS BOS We disclose our expenses. EOS BOS We will continue to disclose our expenses, because it is the right thing to do. EOS BOS Canadians deserve openness and transparency. EOS BOS Our government will continue to deliver that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after missing the deadline set by his own department, the President of the Treasury Board finally reported his travel expenses. EOS BOS However, the same cannot be said of some of his colleagues who are late in doing so or have provided incomplete information. EOS BOS Canadians deserve better than this pseudo-transparency. EOS BOS When will we have proactive disclosure? EOS BOS Are they going to disclose information only when they get caught breaking the rules? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is completely open and transparent. EOS BOS We report our expenses and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, we learned that a Canadian-funded Syrian hospital was bombed. EOS BOS Such acts are clearly unacceptable and an assault on the rights of every woman and man in the world. EOS BOS Can the Minister of International Development tell the House what our government has done in response to this despicable act? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with my colleague. The attack was utterly unacceptable, as is any such act targeting doctors, humanitarian workers, and the women and children who are there because they need care. EOS BOS Our government strongly condemns such violations of international humanitarian law. EOS BOS That is why, yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and I announced that Canada was co-sponsoring the United Nations Security Council resolution on protection of medical personnel and hospitals. EOS BOS The resolution was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council this morning. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when the Prime Minister interrupted a woman at a town hall, correcting her use of “mankind” with “peoplekind“, his mansplaining went viral. EOS BOS Around the world, the Prime Minister was mocked for his political correctness. EOS BOS The Prime Minister eventually conceded that it was a dumb joke, but his principal secretary, Gerald Butts, tweeted that any and all who criticized his boss were Nazis. EOS BOS The Prime Minister once said that any statement by Mr. Butts could be considered his own, and in this case? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a question in that statement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Nazis killed six million Jews. EOS BOS People who laugh at the Prime Minister are not Nazis. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister disassociate himself from his principal secretary's unacceptable language? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we, as all of us do, take very seriously the Holocaust and make sure we remind ourselves never again by telling the story of the Holocaust and not relating that to anything else that happened. EOS BOS We recognize that this is something of extreme difficulty and care must be taken. EOS BOS I have always ensured that we are respectful in our discourse, particularly around that subject. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since 2008, the number of Quebeckers turning to food banks has jumped by 22%. EOS BOS Poverty is affecting an increasing number of people, but the government continues to turn a blind eye. EOS BOS The Conservatives are so out of touch with reality that they chose to put an end to government stimulus measures. EOS BOS That is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS What real steps will the government take to stimulate the economy and create jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I feel a bit like I am in the movie Groundhog Day. EOS BOS I am up again to say exactly the same thing: the best way to fight poverty is to get Canadians working. EOS BOS The economic action plan has created 650,000 net new jobs since July 2009. EOS BOS The best way to fight poverty is not the NDP's approach of increasing taxes; it is about providing people with jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we keep asking the same questions because the government does not understand. EOS BOS More than 60% of the Quebeckers who use food banks have exhausted all of their resources and are now living on social assistance. EOS BOS They are stretched to the limit, but the government keeps saying that all is well. EOS BOS What will this government do to give them a hand up? EOS BOS What is the government waiting for to help them find affordable housing and return to work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will try to say it again, once and for all, so that the NDP really understands what we have done to reduce the tax burden on families. EOS BOS We proposed a new children's arts tax credit, but the NDP voted against it. EOS BOS We proposed a new family caregiver tax credit. EOS BOS What did the NDP do? EOS BOS They voted against it. EOS BOS We proposed a new and improved medical expense tax credit. EOS BOS What did they do? EOS BOS They voted against it. EOS BOS The list goes on. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has to stop hiding in gopher holes. EOS BOS Food bank use is up 80% since 2008 in our northern communities, and that does not even tell the whole story. EOS BOS Families in many of our remote communities do not even have access to food banks. EOS BOS We are entering another cold winter. EOS BOS Why is the government allowing northern families to be left behind? EOS BOS When will it create an anti-poverty strategy that helps northerners who cannot afford to feed their families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us go through some of the things that this government has put forward that the NDP has voted against: the working income tax benefit, to help make work pay and help low-income families get over the welfare wall; tax cuts, which mean over a million low-income Canadians do not pay income taxes at all anymore; enhancing the national child benefit, and the child tax benefit. EOS BOS These are all things we have put forward as a government to help Canadian families, and the NDP has voted against them all. EOS
BOS I draw the attention of hon. EOS BOS members to the presence in the gallery of members from the group, Fostering Open eXpression among Youth, who are the winners of the million dollar 2014 Arctic Inspiration Prize. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS Pursuant to an order made Tuesday, December 9, the House will now resolve itself into committee of the whole to thank the House of Commons security personnel following the events of October 22, 2014. EOS BOS I do now leave the chair for the House to resolve itself into committee of the whole. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been 299 days since the Azer children were abducted by their father. EOS BOS We now know that the children are in Iran. EOS BOS How much longer do these children need to be in harm's way? EOS BOS When will the government demand that Iran safely return these four Canadian children? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the safety and well-being of the Azer children are a priority for this government. EOS BOS The Prime Minister did meet with Ms. Azer and reiterated justice. EOS BOS Our parliamentary secretary for consular affairs remains in frequent communication with Ms. Azer. EOS BOS It is important to understand that he is doing all he can as we continue to work both at home and abroad for the children's safe return. EOS BOS We will not stop until the children are reunited with their mother. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government and many people in Edmonton and elsewhere were disappointed to learn earlier today that convicted terrorist Omar Ahmed Khadr has been released from prison today on the streets of Edmonton. EOS BOS The Globe and Mail described this individual as having been raised to be a terrorist, which is not surprising since the members of his entire family are proudly admitted terrorists. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness update the House on this ongoing situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are in fact disappointed with today's decision and regret that a convicted terrorist has been allowed back into Canadian society without having served his full sentence. EOS BOS Omar Ahmed Khadr pleaded guilty to heinous crimes, including the murder of American army medic, Sergeant Christopher Speer, and he has admitted that his ideology has not changed. EOS BOS While the Liberal leader refused to rule out special compensation for this convicted terrorist and the NDP actively tries to force Canadian taxpayers to compensate him, we believe that the real victims of crime, not the perpetrators, are the ones who deserve compensation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, speaking of victims of crime, sexual assault is a devastating crime and one of the most difficult to prosecute. EOS BOS Survivors deserve to be treated with the utmost respect and dignity. EOS BOS However, the DNA collection kits provided by the RCMP are badly out of date. EOS BOS They often use painful and obsolete techniques, and even worse, they risk DNA evidence degradation. EOS BOS A new kit has been developed, but the RCMP will not say when they will distribute it. EOS BOS Will the minister make this a priority? EOS BOS Will the government expedite the distribution of new DNA collection kits to help professionals across Canada? EOS BOS This is a matter of justice. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you know it is on this side of the House that the Conservative government has continuously supported providing resources to the RCMP and funding. EOS BOS We have done it through crime prevention measures to keep communities safe, Of course, any crime that is against any Canadian citizen is a horrific crime, especially those of a sexual nature. I just want to thank the RCMP for being able to work in this situation to be able to solve these most heinous crimes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what matters most to victims of sexual assault is getting justice. EOS BOS However, we have learned that existing rape kits, which are distributed by the RCMP, are outdated and no longer meet forensic standards. EOS BOS We know that a new kit is being produced right now, but we have no idea when it will be available. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us when this new kit will be distributed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again it is on this side of the House that we have continuously funded the RCMP to ensure that they have the resources necessary to keep Canadians safe. EOS BOS In fact, it is this government that raised and invested more funding into the RCMP seven times since 2006. EOS BOS The opposition party has said no to each of those increases. EOS BOS Budget 2015 increases our funding to national security agencies by $300 million, and most important, it is this Conservative government that brought in the victims bill of rights to stand up and make sure that victims have a voice in the criminal justice system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's videos revealed the identity of Special Operations troops to terrorists. EOS BOS The PMO staff broke DND protocols that protect our Armed Forces. EOS BOS They said they had DND's consent; they did not. EOS BOS We now know PMO staff received two briefings on operational security protocols, yet they still published these propaganda videos. EOS BOS Why has not anyone in the PMO been fired for putting our troops and their families at risk? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have already said in here, we regret this error. EOS BOS We have apologized and we are reviewing all the protocols to ensure it does not happen again. EOS BOS These videos should not have been posted. EOS BOS However, General Tom Lawson, who is the Chief of the Defence Staff, said:Following a CAF assessment of the photos and video in question, we have determined, though the risk is assessed as low, to recommend two not be posted. EOS BOS There is certainly no requirement for any CAF personnel to be withdrawn from Op IMPACT. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Revenue keeps saying that the CRA recovered $25 billion from tax havens. EOS BOS However, her department's report that came out today indicates that it is more like $33 million for the last fiscal year. EOS BOS That leaves a shortfall of just $24,967,000,000, which is 1,000 times less than the minister claims. EOS BOS Does the minister have a flair for exaggeration or is she getting her millions mixed up with her billions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to collecting taxes and combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. EOS BOS We are on track to recovering that $25 billion, as a result of audits conducted over the past two years. EOS BOS Every company and individual affected by these audits received notices of assessment. EOS BOS The CRA is recovering money that is owed to Canadians. EOS BOS No one is above the law. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's rush to process Syrian refugees has resulted in a backlog of almost 45,000 privately sponsored refugees. EOS BOS This means that many of the world's most persecuted—including Iraqi Christians, Yazidis, and LGBTQ+, many of whom are internally displaced and cannot survive the process of getting onto a UNHRC list—remain in peril, even though Canadians have fundraised to bring them to Canada. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister turning his back on both generous Canadian donors and persecuted minorities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am proud of our government's results and leadership in welcoming refugees, which was recognized in Canada and around the world. EOS BOS [English]
              This year we will have allocations of 40,000 people for protected persons and refugees. EOS BOS That includes 25,000 resettled refugees from abroad, which is double what that party and that member committed to, and 16,000 privately sponsored refugees, which is almost quadruple what that party and that member committed to. EOS BOS We will take no lessons on refugee resettlement from that member and that party. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, every day, thousands of cyclists and pedestrians cross railroad tracks at unprotected locations to avoid long detours. EOS BOS They have been asking for years for safe crossings. EOS BOS The act clearly gives the minister the authority to order the closure or modification of a railway crossing, but it is unclear as to whether he has the authority to open a new one. I have heard different interpretations of this legislation from different government members. EOS BOS Bill C-322 seeks to remedy that situation. EOS BOS Will the minister support my bill and take on the authority needed to keep Canadians safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to assure everyone that the government is aware of the importance of rail safety and we remind all those who cross railway tracks illegally by going under or over fences that they are doing something illegal and dangerous. EOS BOS Last year, there were 46 rail fatalities and 19 people lost their lives at railway crossings. EOS BOS It is a very dangerous thing to do. EOS BOS There are already mechanisms in place to consider the need for railway crossings. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to the Prime Minister, it is crazy to keep his Copenhagen promises and regulate the oil and gas industry at any price per barrel. EOS BOS What is even more crazy is to blow off presidents Obama and Hollande and Prime Minister Cameron and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. EOS BOS It is crazy to blow off the Lima climate change conference. EOS BOS It is crazy to embarrass his minister. EOS BOS Mind you, she does a pretty good job of it all by herself. EOS BOS Why not just keep this crazy train going, and actually regulate the oil and gas industry? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister said, Canada would not take unilateral action and impose taxes and monetary penalties on the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS Let us take a look at the Liberals' record. EOS BOS When they were in power, they signed on to the Kyoto accord without any plan, without any details, and we saw greenhouse gases go up 30%.We are working with our partners in the United States so that we take a North American solution to this. EOS BOS We have always said we would like to work together with the United States, and we are going to do it without a job-killing carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's failure to champion strong environmental policies is damaging our economy and killing jobs. EOS BOS Its neo-Conservative ideology is hindering the ability of our exporters to get their products to market. EOS BOS When the Prime Minister broke his promise to regulate greenhouse gases, he once again damaged the petroleum sector. EOS BOS What kind of crazy economics is that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what would be crazy is the Liberals' plan. EOS BOS As I said earlier, they would take unilateral action to impose taxes and monetary penalties on the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS They would act unilaterally to impose a job-killing carbon tax. EOS BOS They would gamble with 275,000 jobs. EOS BOS We are not going to do that. EOS BOS We are going to support hard-working Canadians because we believe on this side that we are the only party that can be trusted to lower greenhouse gas emissions while growing the economy. EOS BOS That is real leadership. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under CETA, Canada will, for the fist time, permit foreign-owned vessels to transport goods between Canadian ports and will open up domestic dredging contracts to foreign suppliers. EOS BOS This will lead to the immediate loss of 3,000 high-quality, good-paying Canadian seafarers' jobs, and threaten tens of thousands more. EOS BOS Why is the minister refusing to address CETA's negative impacts and continuing to push through a deal that will hurt Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, CETA is clearly in Canada's national interest, and I call on all members of this House to rise above partisan politics and support it. EOS BOS I have been astonished to hear the NDP consistently opposing this agreement and dragging its feet in the House, particularly at a time when the forces of protectionism in the world are threatening Canadian jobs. EOS BOS All 28 European member states support CETA, including socialist parties in government. EOS BOS All of the provinces strongly CETA, including Quebec. EOS BOS Are there any trade deals that the NDP supports? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime Minister is a little confused because most recently the most popular Liberal announcements are when the Liberals are announcing that they are cancelling their previous announcements. EOS BOS The fact is that with the current government Canadians will pay more taxes, and they know that the government will always protect its own personal interests and those of its Liberal friends. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has spent weeks defending the finance minister's attack on local businesses while that same minister used loopholes to protect his own personal fortune, so I have a very simple question. EOS BOS Was the Prime Minister aware that his finance minister still controlled millions of dollars of stock in Morneau Shepell while his government— EOS </s> BOS The Right Hon. Prime Minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we made a promise to Canadians two years ago to lower taxes on the middle class and to raise them on the wealthiest one per cent, to deliver a Canada child benefit that would grow the economy and help Canadian families right across the country, to strengthen the CPP, and to increase the guaranteed income supplement that would help the most vulnerable seniors. EOS BOS These were things we promised to do because they would grow the economy. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are seeing. EOS BOS We have the fastest growth in the G7 and have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, because putting money in the pockets of Canadians— EOS </s> BOS The hon. minister for Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for the past two weeks, the Minister of Finance has been hiding behind the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to avoid taking responsibility for his actions. EOS BOS That same Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner wrote to him, saying, “ EOS BOS If your official duties provide an opportunity to further your private interests or those of your relatives or friends, you are considered to be in conflict of interest”. EOS BOS That is exactly what we saw with Bill C-27, which he himself introduced. EOS BOS Why is the minister still refusing to take responsibility for his actions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the opposition's misleading insinuations are false. EOS BOS There is no conflict of interest. EOS BOS The minister acted on all of the commissioner's recommendations, which included setting up an ethical screen, which the commissioner said was the most effective way to handle things. EOS BOS The minister followed all the rules and is willing to go above and beyond what the commissioner suggested. EOS BOS That is what people expect of this government and every member of this House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for two years, he let everyone believe that he had put his assets in a blind trust. EOS BOS [English]
              The fact is, when the Liberal defence minister was found in 2002 to have given a $36,000 contract to a company owned by an ex-girlfriend, he was asked to resign from cabinet. EOS BOS When the same year, the Liberal solicitor general was found to have given a $6-million contract to a college presided by his brother, he was asked to resign. EOS BOS However, when this finance minister tables a bill that allows him to gain $2 million through shares he never placed in a blind trust, he gets a free pass. EOS BOS Why is the finance minister held to a lower ethical standard? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the opposition is torquing up insinuations with no basis. EOS BOS The minister followed all the guidance of the commissioner, including setting up a screen that was determined to be the best measure of compliance by the commissioner. EOS BOS The minister has followed the rules and is willing to go above and beyond. EOS BOS However, I understand why the opposition wants to talk about these things and not about what matters to Canadians, growing the economy, because there is such good news coming for Canadians. EOS BOS We have the fastest growth in the G7. EOS BOS We have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, and we are continuing to invest and putting money in the pockets of the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the finance minister is desperate to change the channel by performing some magic tricks, Canadians understand that he has used public policy for his own advantage. EOS BOS Bill C-27 is not only bad legislation and an attack against good pension plans, it is also very good news for some people, for example, Morneau Shepell. EOS BOS The finance minister was supposed to put his assets in a blind trust. EOS BOS He did not do it. EOS BOS The Liberals were supposed to tackle the tax loophole of the CEOs. EOS BOS They did not do it. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop working for their friends on Bay Street and work for the common good? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last night we got an opportunity to hear from Quebecers and people across the country about how we were doing as a country and how we are doing in terms of growing the economy. EOS BOS The priorities that Canadians showed actually demonstrated that we are on the right track. EOS BOS We are moving forward and continuing to put money into the pockets of the middle class, and growing the economy in ways that work for everyone. EOS BOS We will stay focused on Canadians while the opposition stays focused on Liberals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Liberals are the government. 
              [Translation] EOS BOS The Liberals bumped up their economic update in a desperate attempt to sidestep a scandal, but no one is fooled. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance introduced a bill that directly benefits his company. EOS BOS He was supposed to put his company in a blind trust, but he did not, just as he was supposed to tackle the little arrangements that their big CEO friends have. EOS BOS Instead of attacking people who take the bus, instead of attacking employee discounts, instead of attacking people with diabetes, could the Liberals start checking the pockets of their friends on Bay Street? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals went to Lac-Saint-Jean to talk to the locals about what was happening there, what they need, what we could do to help them and where we could do more. EOS BOS The people of Lac-Saint-Jean told us that things were going well. EOS BOS They thanked us for our work and gave us their vote of confidence by sending Richard Hébert here to be the next member for Lac-Saint-Jean. EOS BOS That is exactly what we wanted to do. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are going to announce this afternoon. EOS BOS We are implementing a plan that is working for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here are some plain facts. EOS BOS On February 20, 2013, two years before being appointed, the Minister of Finance was arguing in favour of a bill that would create target benefit plans. EOS BOS Three years later, on October 19, 2016, the minister introduced Bill C-27, which would create these very plans. EOS BOS What a coincidence. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Finance admit that he has not fulfilled his obligations and that he has a real conflict of interest, as proven by the $2 million he has personally pocketed since becoming finance minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, here are some more plain facts. EOS BOS As soon as he was appointed, the Minister of Finance met with the Ethics Commissioner to ensure that he was following all the rules we are subject to. EOS BOS He followed the ethics commissioner's recommendations and last week he announced that he would go even further. EOS BOS Here are a few more plain facts, if members are interested. EOS BOS Two years ago, we wondered if we were in or headed towards a recession. EOS BOS Now, two years after the Minister of Finance took office, it is very clear that Canada is not in a recession. EOS BOS Canada's growth is the envy of the entire world, and that is thanks to our Minister of Finance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians cannot be fooled. EOS BOS The minister tabled a bill that would benefit his own company, which was still paying him more than $65,000 a month in dividends. EOS BOS This is a clear-cut conflict of interest. EOS BOS This government claims to be a beacon of integrity and transparency. EOS BOS Today they must prove it. EOS BOS The minister must give us a straight answer. EOS BOS Yes or no, did he tell the Ethics Commissioner that he was in a direct conflict of interest? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there was no conflict of interest, because the Minister of Finance met with the Ethics Commissioner as soon as he took office to make sure he was following all of the rules that govern us. EOS BOS All of her recommendations, including putting a conflict of interest screen in place, were followed from day one. EOS BOS Last week, the minister went even further by announcing that he would divest himself of his shares in Morneau Shepell and place all of his assets in a blind trust so he could continue the important work he does for all Canadians, the work of putting the Canadian economy back on the path to growth and prosperity for all. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, these are the facts as we know them. EOS BOS As executive chair of Morneau Shepell, the minister lobbied on behalf of targeted pension plans. EOS BOS When he became the minister, he brought legislation in to make these law. EOS BOS He also collected dividends from the company because he still had shares. EOS BOS Now the hon. EOS BOS member mentioned an ethics screen, and that may very well be in place. EOS BOS However, I want to know something specific. EOS BOS Given all of these conflicts around this issue, did the minister recuse himself from any of the discussions around Bill C-27? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance did put in place an ethics screen, which was recommended by the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS She described it as the best measure of compliance possible. EOS BOS He has always followed the recommendations, will continue to do so, and work in a forthcoming and transparent manner with the Ethics Commissioner, going above and beyond her recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, did the ethics screen enable the minister to have discussions on a company that he controlled, that he received $65,000 a month from, that he himself lobbied for in the past? EOS BOS The minister would say to us, “ EOS BOS Oh, you're so concerned about my personal finances.” EOS BOS Actually, we are not. EOS BOS We are caring far much more about exactly what ethical screen he had in place, and if he did the right thing. EOS BOS This is not about Bay Street; this is about Main Street. EOS BOS Canadians want to know this. EOS BOS Did the minister recuse himself when we had these discussions on Bill C-27? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that the Minister of Finance, from the get-go, has always worked with the Ethics Commissioner to make sure he is in full compliance with the rules that govern us all as parliamentarians, and respected her recommendations. EOS BOS He has gone even further, going above and beyond her recommendations. EOS BOS Working for Main Street is exactly what the Minister of Finance has done for the last two years, lowering taxes for nine million Canadians and steering the Canadian economy back into the direction of growth and prosperity for all. EOS BOS We can be very proud of our finance minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, share prices for Morneau Shepell went up by 5% the day after the Minister of Finance tabled Bill C-27. EOS BOS The bill directly affects pensions, which Morneau Shepell is in the business of selling. EOS BOS This is a clear conflict of interest. EOS BOS The minister promised the House, the Ethics Commissioner, the media, and anyone who would listen that he would recuse himself from decisions involving Morneau Shepell, but he has not done that. EOS BOS Did the minister receive written approval from the Ethics Commissioner to introduce pension legislation that turned out to be a windfall for the minister and for Morneau Shepell? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleague that the Minister of Finance will always work with the Ethics Commissioner to make sure he is in full compliance with all of the rules that govern us. EOS BOS Last week, he announced that he would be going even further to avoid any distraction from the important work he does for Canadians. EOS BOS His work has led to the creation of 400,000 jobs over the past two years, the vast majority of them full-time, as well as the fastest growth rate in the G7. EOS BOS That is a track record the Conservatives cannot boast of, after 10 years of failing on the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear. EOS BOS The minister has introduced legislation that directly benefits the company in which he owns millions of shares. EOS BOS In fact, his shares have increased by a whopping 33% since the minister was sworn in. EOS BOS While in charge of Morneau Shepell, he lobbied for the exact legislation that he now proposes in Bill C-27. EOS BOS The minister is right about one thing. EOS BOS His conflicts of interests are in fact serious distractions. EOS BOS Does the minister actually believe it was ethical of him to table Bill C-27, knowing it would further feather his own nest? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Commissioner is there to preserve the integrity of this institution and of parliamentarians. EOS BOS We believe in the Ethics Commissioner and in her recommendations. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance has always followed her recommendations in order to be in full compliance with the rules. EOS BOS Last week, he said he would go the extra mile to continue his important work. EOS BOS I invite hon. EOS BOS members to come here at 4 p.m. to listen to the Minister of Finance confirm that the Canadian economy is doing well and is working for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Bill C-10 is a complete sellout of the aerospace industry in Manitoba. EOS BOS However, the Liberals just seem to be shrugging off the damage it is doing. EOS BOS They are even ignoring the new Premier of Manitoba, and all of those people in Manitoba whose jobs are going to be lost. EOS BOS My question is: Will even one Liberal member of Parliament, there are seven of them, stand up and speak on behalf of the aerospace industry and those important jobs in our province? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, my colleague could not be more wrong. EOS BOS We are focused on growing the economy of our country and creating jobs. EOS BOS That includes in the aerospace sector. EOS BOS We know that the Government of Manitoba and Air Canada came to an agreement to create at least 150 jobs in the aerospace sector in Manitoba, starting in 2017. EOS BOS It is a good start, but if we want to go further than that, if we want to grow the economy in our country, including speaking with the people of Manitoba and the Government of Manitoba to help build their aerospace industry, that is what we are going to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Transport said that we must move quickly, and he moved a time allocation motion for Bill C-10. EOS BOS One of his arguments was that the Government of Quebec decided not to sue Air Canada. EOS BOS However, things are not going the minister's way because, this morning, Quebec's economy minister said that the federal government must not hinder her negotiations with Air Canada. EOS BOS He is saying one thing, but Quebec's minister is saying the opposite today. EOS BOS That is not good. EOS BOS I am sorry to bring the minister back to earth, but why did he really impose closure? Why is he hindering the discussions? EOS BOS What are the Liberals trying to hide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this gives me a chance to repeat what I said. EOS BOS The reason we imposed closure yesterday was very clear. EOS BOS Last Friday, the NDP tried to kill this bill. EOS BOS In our fine democracy, we know full well that there are still many stages for Bill C-10 to go through before it reaches the end of the process. EOS BOS We are going to move to committee stage where we will listen to witnesses. EOS BOS Then there will be report stage, followed by third reading. EOS BOS The bill will then follow the same process in the Senate. EOS BOS There is still a lot of time for everyone to be heard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with Bill C-38, the government is cutting the heart out of our small communities by attacking library services. EOS BOS The government plans to eliminate the only program that has provided reliable high-speed Internet access to small communities. EOS BOS Saint-Adelphe, in my riding, is one such community. EOS BOS How does the minister plan to provide fair access to the cultural and historic heritage of our communities, no matter where they are located? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not at all the case. EOS BOS We have invested in these types of programs in the past and we continue to do so today, all the while ensuring more efficiency than ever before. EOS BOS There are new electronic programs that ensure that the collections the member spoke about are available, and not just in one region, but across the entire country. EOS BOS That is what Library and Archives Canada is doing. EOS BOS If there is an issue or a problem in her riding that specifically affects a library, I am sure that we can discuss it and find a solution. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, like most actual conservatives who believe in markets, I was amused by the Minister of Industry's staged photo op in a toy store on Tuesday. EOS BOS I find the notion that, somehow, merchants can be shamed by the Competition Bureau into lowering their prices is, to use the Prime Minister's economic qualifier, “crazy economic policy”.If the Minister of Industry is really interested in preventing price gouging, why does he not look at some of his government's own market distorting policies that increase consumer prices, like tariffs, fuel taxes, an oligopolistic telecom market, and even supply management? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on average, Canadians pay roughly 15% more for goods in Canada compared to goods available in the U.S. EOS BOS These price differences are real. EOS BOS They hurt the bottom line of hard-working families. EOS BOS We will continue to stand up for hard-working Canadian families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, by announcing that the RCMP will analyze the Panama papers data made public this week, the government wants to show that it is serious about cracking down on tax evasion. EOS BOS However, the Prime Minister is doing everything he can to block the investigation into the 15 multimillionaires who illegally hid money in tax havens with the help of KPMG.Can the Prime Minister explain why there is a double standard? EOS BOS Who are the KPMG clients and executives that he is trying to protect? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we indicated very clearly that it is vital that all Canadians pay their fair share of taxes. EOS BOS That is why we added $440 million to the budget. EOS BOS We want the Canada Revenue Agency to crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS That is why a Liberal MP, in committee, proposed an investigation into KPMG, and why we are working so hard: we want to ensure that all Canadians and all companies pay their fair share of taxes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, actually it was the NDP that proposed it, and it was voted down by the Liberals. EOS BOS The Panama papers revealed a vast network of shell companies in offshore tax havens. EOS BOS One Canadian firm, Newport Pacific, created an astonishing 60 companies in known tax havens. EOS BOS The vast majority of these offshore shell companies were set up while the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage worked at Newport Pacific. EOS BOS Has the Prime Minister asked his parliamentary secretary if he assisted in the marketing, development, or design of any offshore companies in tax havens? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party has been very clear that, as government, we are committed to ensuring that all Canadians pay their fair share of taxes and to cutting down on avoidance and tax dodging. EOS BOS The fact is that we put $440 million in this latest budget to ensure that the Canada Revenue Agency has the tools to go after tax avoidance and tax evasion. EOS BOS That is something that we are committed to. EOS BOS That is something that we are working very hard on. EOS BOS That is what we will continue to put forward, regardless of the smears put forward by the members opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, nobody believes the minister any more. EOS BOS He cannot even count, and nobody can count on him. EOS BOS The temporary foreign worker program is a real mess. EOS BOS More unskilled foreign workers are coming to Canada. EOS BOS Unemployment is still high, and the minister's job market numbers do not reflect the reality that businesses are experiencing. EOS BOS When will the minister admit that he messed up? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the government's reforms are a success. We know this because the number of employer requests for temporary foreign workers has dropped by 75%. EOS BOS Just yesterday, I heard about a major employer in Alberta that launched a program to recruit unemployed aboriginal people in its region. EOS BOS That is because of our changes to the temporary foreign worker program, which are putting Canadians first in the job market. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a clear pattern with Conservatives on the temporary foreign worker program. EOS BOS They made promises when the issue was in the news and then did not do anything about them later. EOS BOS In 2013, they gave themselves new powers to inspect. EOS BOS Seven months later not a single inspection had happened. EOS BOS They also promised to crack down on use of the program, and a year later, the number of foreign workers was up by 6%.Why did the Conservatives manage the program so badly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, I would like to invite my colleagues opposite to attend a technical briefing any time they would like so they could actually understand this. EOS BOS For example, the new powers for inspecting workplaces could only be legally applied prospectively for temporary foreign workers who are being applied for and would arrive in the future, not for those who applied in the past. EOS BOS Perhaps the NDP members have a new principle whereby they would like to retroactively apply all new laws, but the reality is that since our reforms were put into place last year, we have seen a reduction by 75% in the number of temporary foreign workers applied for by employers. EOS BOS We are ensuring that Canadians come first in the workforce. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when promises are made but not kept, people lose confidence. EOS BOS The latest economic data from the manufacturing sector are extremely disturbing. EOS BOS It is reported that the sector has declined by 3.1%, and that will cause considerable downward pressure on our GDP.Eighty-two per cent of businesses report a drop in sales. EOS BOS They are losing $1.5 million a month. EOS BOS That is the largest drop since the 2009 recession. EOS BOS When will there be a growth plan for all economic sectors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we already have put real programs on the table—real programs, real policies and real investments in our economy. EOS BOS And we have had real success. EOS BOS As an example, here is what the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters said about our programs: “ EOS BOS The government's policies with respect to taxes, technology, trade, training and transformation are extremely important at setting the stage for growth of advanced manufacturing industries in Canada.”We have put our programs on the table. EOS BOS We have had success. EOS BOS We are creating jobs in every part of the country because we ignore the NDP's suggestions that run counter to the needs of our economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for several years now 6,800 veterans who are disabled have been fighting the government over what is called SISIP benefit reduction. EOS BOS Two DND ombudsmen have said that this is unfair. EOS BOS The veterans committee, the Senate committee and the House all voted to change this practice. EOS BOS Why is the government spending over half a million dollars of hard-earned money fighting these disabled veterans in court? EOS BOS Why does the government not stop the court proceedings, deal with these veterans and reach a comparable settlement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, injured personnel in the Canadian Forces are covered by a long-term disability insurance plan similar to the RCMP and other public servants. EOS BOS As the member well knows, they are also eligible for a Veterans Affairs Canada disability award of up to $270,000 under the new veterans charter, as well as an accidental dismemberment benefit of up to $250,000 under the Canadian Forces accidental dismemberment insurance plan. EOS BOS If the member opposite is referring to a matter that is now before the courts, it would not be appropriate for us to comment on that at this time. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in fairness to the hon. member, as he is new to the House it is quite possible that he does not understand what the SISIP benefit reduction is. EOS BOS It is a sinful, disgraceful act wherein disabled veterans get one aspect of an insurance policy clawed back from their regular benefits. EOS BOS That is why they have gone to court. EOS BOS This court action can stop right now. EOS BOS All it takes is for the Prime Minister to nod his head and stop the court proceedings. EOS BOS He should stop taking these disabled veterans to court and stop Dingwalling this Parliament, as the Treasury Board president and the defence minister are doing, and deal with the disabled heroes of this country in a fair and proper manner. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite cares to review the real statistic, he will find that this government has done more for veterans and more for members of the Canadian Forces than any government in history. EOS BOS The member's party voted against our missions in Afghanistan and Libya, voted against new equipment purchases under Canada's economic action plan, and questioned the minister's effort to do his duty by honouring the families of fallen soldiers during repatriation ceremonies. EOS BOS I would ask the member if he and his party have an ounce of support left for the Canadian Forces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS On February 9, the Prime Minister, along with the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, the Minister of Health, and the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development had the great pleasure of visiting my riding of Nunavut. EOS BOS When there, the Prime Minister signed a declaration with Inuit Nunangat leadership to create the Inuit-Crown partnership committee. EOS BOS Inuit are eager to hear how this committee will change the way the federal government engages with them, and what tangible benefits we can expect from it. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government continues to work in genuine partnership with indigenous people to advance reconciliation, just as we did in signing the declaration with Inuit. EOS BOS I know the member opposite supports moving forward in that direction. EOS BOS I was pleased to be in Iqaluit with the Prime Minister, the ministers and leaders of the Inuit Nunangat region, along with the president of ITK. EOS BOS This agreement means we will work together, government to Crown with Inuit people, to ensure we can deal with the long, dark tragedies of the past of Inuit people in our country, whether it be around relocation, tuberculosis, or residential school settlement. EOS BOS However, it also allows us to move forward in the right direction, working together to build stronger Inuit communities in the north. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been three years since the Auditor General identified serious problems with the temporary foreign worker program. EOS BOS Despite years to fix it, the program is still a mess. EOS BOS Conservative mismanagement of this program puts jobs for Canadian workers at risk. EOS BOS When will this problem get fixed and how much longer do Canadians have to wait until they can get the first crack at Canadian jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very firmly of the belief that Canadians must have first crack at all job opportunities in this country. EOS BOS That is why we brought in programs to help them identify what jobs are available in their skill ranges and areas. EOS BOS We have a whole program to connect Canadians with jobs. EOS BOS We are also looking at the temporary foreign worker program to make sure that it does uphold our values. EOS BOS However, while we are trying to help Canadians get to work, the NDP keeps voting against everything that we are trying to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, no wonder the transport minister could not answer my questions yesterday. EOS BOS It is the finance minister who is calling the shots. EOS BOS We now know the airports are on a fire sale to foreign buyers to fund his infrastructure bank because his runaway spending has drained the treasury. EOS BOS Canadian travellers will now be forced to pay higher costs and more fees to foreign airport owners to pay for the Liberals' reckless spending. EOS BOS Will the minister or anybody on that side finally admit that the airports are being sold solely because they have run out of money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this offers me another opportunity to point out something that I began pointing out last November, and that is that it is of the highest priority that we improve passenger service in the country. EOS BOS We are trying to lower prices. EOS BOS We are trying to offer more choice. EOS BOS We are trying to reduce the amount of time to go through security, or to go through customs, and yes, we are committed to a regime of rights for air passengers. EOS BOS Those are the factors that guide us in our decisions with respect to airports and airlines. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand the Minister of Transport's distress. EOS BOS The Liberal government has been spending recklessly since it came to power. EOS BOS According to certain sources, the government is preparing to sell airports to finance its infrastructure bank scheme. EOS BOS Now that the Minister of Transport has realized that the bank machine is out of money, he is going to sell the furniture to pay the interest on the Minister of Finance's credit card. EOS BOS Instead of having a fire sale on March 22, will the government put its finances in order and present Canadians with a plan to balance the budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague for the question because it gives me the opportunity to reiterate that our highest priority is improving passenger service. EOS BOS I think that people are beginning to notice that costs are going down and that they have more choice. EOS BOS They know we want to reduce the time it takes to go through security or customs. EOS BOS Furthermore, there will be a regime of rights for air passengers. EOS BOS That is what is important for our airports and that is what guides us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in August we saw that the number of people receiving employment insurance benefits increased by 6.6%. EOS BOS This number continues to rise, but the government is cutting employment insurance services and turning its back on Canadian families when they need it most. EOS BOS This government needs to stop hiding behind excuses. EOS BOS When will it stop giving tax cuts to its corporate buddies and help the people who need employment insurance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government was given a strong mandate to create jobs and lower taxes, a low tax plan for jobs and growth. EOS BOS This plan is working, with the creation of over 650,000 new jobs since July 2009. EOS BOS We are focused on what matters to Canadians: job growth, expanding the economy, investing in skills training, and helping those who are the hardest hit. EOS BOS In budget 2011, our hiring tax credit for small businesses provides a one-year EI tax break for over 525,000 small businesses. EOS BOS These initiatives are creating jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, families have known for a long time that under the Conservative government they are just not getting ahead. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Canadian Index of Wellbeing reported the same findings the Conference Board did a month ago. EOS BOS They reported that the gap between the rich and the rest of us is growing and employment insurance claims are rising dramatically. EOS BOS This is the reality for Canadian families, and still the Conservatives refuse to act. EOS BOS When will the government start fighting for families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we continue to fight for families, but the NDP fights against everything we want to put forward in legislation that does help families. EOS BOS Canadian families want jobs. EOS BOS The best social program that any government can provide is an environment where the private sector can grow jobs. EOS BOS We have all heard time and again that over 650,000 jobs were created, not totally because of our economic action plan but because of all the implementation. EOS BOS I would remind hon. EOS BOS members that the NDP voted against every one of those initiatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces are among our country's greatest assets and parliamentarians often wish to visit military bases such as Base Gagetown in the riding I represent, to establish relationships and learn about our Armed Forces. EOS BOS The previous government restricted members' access by requiring ministerial approval for such visits, significantly hampering opposition members. EOS BOS Could the Minister of National Defence share what measures he has taken to improve access to military bases for all parliamentarians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that our government has fulfilled its commitment and has reversed the policy of the previous Conservative government. EOS BOS Members of Parliament and senators no longer require ministerial approval in order to visit a military establishment. EOS BOS Requests are now only subject to the discretion of the base commander or a commanding officer. EOS BOS It is important for parliamentarians and senators to have unimpeded access to our military all across Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what will it take for the minister to finally get the message? EOS BOS Her attacks on Atlantic Canadians are hurting our outports, hurting our communities, and the news only gets worst for the east. EOS BOS The latest victim of Conservative cuts to the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is a regional development agency in Cape Breton that is two decades old. EOS BOS First, it had to lay off half its staff. EOS BOS Now its doors have been shut for good. EOS BOS The Conservatives are slashing front-line agencies that foster development. EOS BOS How does that help grow Atlantic Canada's economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the decision to stop contributing to the costs of the daily operations and expenditures of the regional economic development organizations will allow for a more efficient economic development in the Atlantic region by reducing duplication and overlap. EOS BOS This will allow us to focus our efforts and resources on providing directly to entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses and communities, the programs that are aimed at creating jobs for Atlantic Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are just asking for a little communication on this side. EOS BOS Over 70,000 people have been killed in the Syrian war and 400,000 are living in refugee camps. EOS BOS As war rages, Syrian Canadians have asked the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism for a meeting hundreds of times, but the minister has stonewalled them. EOS BOS None of us in the House would want our families left in these conditions. EOS BOS It is a simple request. EOS BOS Will the minister meet with representatives from the Syrian Canadian community? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not think we have to look too far down the list of things the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism has committed to on a weekly basis. EOS BOS Every single weekend he is out and meeting with people in communities at all ends of this country. EOS BOS If a meeting is required and it needs to happen, there is no other minister who is prepared to sit down, listen and work with those in need and who in fact need to sit down with him. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the situation in Syria is worsening every day. EOS BOS Many Syrians have even risked their lives to escape Syria and are now spending the winter in overcrowded refugee camps. EOS BOS Canadians of Syrian origin are concerned that members of their family are caught up in this conflict. EOS BOS The government agreed to expedite the reunification of Syrian families weeks ago. EOS BOS Why have no real measures yet been taken to address this matter? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if we are going to talk about the file in respect to immigration, let us look at Bill C-31 in terms of the refugee reforms in this country, or Bill C-43, the faster removal of foreign criminals act. EOS BOS We can look at the work that has been done within this ministry time and time again to get backlogs down to ensure that those who have high skills and need to work in this country are going to get here on a much faster basis. EOS BOS All of those backlogs are down. EOS BOS We are doing what is right for the Canadian economy in terms of how we are focused on immigration and we are going to continue to do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a report from the correctional investigator has sounded the alarm on the situation of young adults in federal prisons. EOS BOS They are vulnerable to exploitation, bullying, and abuse. EOS BOS What is more, they are overrepresented in terms of placement in segregation and use-of-force incidents. EOS BOS (1500)
              [English]
              The government promised major reforms emphasizing rehabilitation and protecting vulnerable people. EOS BOS Will the government respect the report's recommendations and abolish the use of solitary confinement on those under age 21, in favour of proper rehabilitation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we recognize the work that needs to be done in our correctional services, and I am proud of the work that our Minister of Public Safety is doing on exactly that. EOS BOS We are moving forward on a broad range of initiatives and recommendations made, including the restoration of prison farms, the diminution of the use of solitary confinement, the kinds of things that we know will not just do a better job of respecting rights but will also keep our communities safer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals ran on a platform of growing the economy from the heart out. EOS BOS Since December, Canada has lost over 51,000 manufacturing jobs and fallen to 10th place in the world in business competitiveness. EOS BOS Output is dropping, unemployment is rising, and the heart out approach is not working. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop ripping the heart out of Canadian manufacturers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is committed to providing an innovation agenda to help grow the economy and create prosperity. EOS BOS We will be working with all members of the House by shortly announcing this innovation agenda. EOS BOS We will be taking a look at different aspects of where Canada's economy should be, whether that is in the clean tech sector, in incubators, or in the manufacturing sector. EOS BOS We are also looking forward to the committee report from the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on the manufacturing sector and the additive manufacturing sector. EOS BOS We believe in growing this economy and creating prosperity and jobs for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I will remind the government that there are indeed rules to separate the use of taxpayer-funded resources from political party fundraising. EOS BOS The government should have gotten this lesson after seeing the NDP accused of using taxpayer-funded mailings and satellite offices to subsidize its own political operations. EOS BOS Now we have learned that the Prime Minister has been flying his own top fundraiser on his government plane and reimbursing only a fraction of the actual cost back to the people. EOS BOS He has also been increasing his own private use of the Challenger jets by over 300% since forming a majority government. EOS BOS Will the government rise to the challenge and stop subsidizing the Conservative Party's fundraising efforts by using Challenger jets? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was embarrassed for the Leader of the Opposition when he talked about spending the resources of Canadians responsibly and then to have a Liberal ask a question like this. EOS BOS When the Liberals were in power, they used the Challenger jets as their own little personal taxi service. EOS BOS We have reduced that by 75% since the time when they were in government. EOS BOS Unlike the Liberals, this Prime Minister has brought in a policy whereby if he does something personally or if it is based on the party, the costs are reimbursed to the taxpayers. EOS BOS That is a policy that this Prime Minister brought in. EOS BOS The RCMP is of course in charge of his security at the same time. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when the going gets tough, the tough get going, to Peru apparently. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's chief of staff gave Mike Duffy a $90,000 cheque. EOS BOS In exchange Duffy paid--Some hon. EOS BOS members: Oh! EOS BOS Oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Opposition has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's chief of staff gave Mike Duffy a $90,000 cheque. EOS BOS In exchange, Duffy paid off illegal expenses, stopped co-operating with auditors, and the PMO said in writing that they would go easy on him. EOS BOS In his own words,  Senator Duffy “stayed silent on the orders of the Prime Minister's Office”. EOS BOS A secret cash payment from the Prime Minister's chief of staff was negotiated by the Prime Minister's own lawyer. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister call in the RCMP and release all documents related to this secret backroom deal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been very clear that he was not aware of the payment until last week, after it had been reported publicly in the media. EOS BOS The Prime Minister spoke very loudly and very clearly this morning. EOS BOS Furthermore, this matter has been referred to two independent bodies for review. EOS BOS We look forward to the results of these reviews. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, many questions remain unanswered about the secret deal made by the Prime Minister's Office, the report that was doctored to clear a senator and the so-called gift of $90,000.When did the Prime Minister find out about the negotiations between his chief of staff, Nigel Wright, and Senator Duffy? EOS BOS Was the new chief of staff, Ray Novak, aware of this scheme? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister was not aware of the payment until last week after it was reported in the media,  and neither was his current chief of staff. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Mike Duffy agreed to “stay silent on the orders of the PMO”. EOS BOS In exchange, the Prime Minister's Office agreed to cover the cost of the senator's fraudulent expenses. EOS BOS Why were taxpayer-funded lawyers used to negotiate this secret backroom deal between the Prime Minister's chief of staff and Senator Duffy? EOS BOS Was taxpayers' money used to bankroll Senate-gate, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it will come as no surprise to the Leader of the Opposition that I reject much of the premise of his question. EOS BOS I have been very clear and the government has been very clear that the Prime Minister was not aware of this payment until media reports surfaced last week. EOS BOS Let me be very clear on that point. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning's press conference left us with many unanswered questions. EOS BOS We still do not know if the Prime Minister knew about his chief of staff's sudden generosity or if he had anything to do with the whitewashing of the Senate audit. EOS BOS His role has yet to become clear. EOS BOS I have a very simple question. EOS BOS What did the Prime Minister know and when did he know it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, one has to be able to roll during question period. EOS BOS The government has provided a very clear answer. EOS BOS I cannot be more clear EOS BOS . I cannot be more specific. EOS BOS I did indicate to the Leader of the Opposition that the Prime Minister was not aware of this payment until after it surfaced in the media last week. EOS BOS I cannot be any more clear to the House and I cannot be any more clear to the member opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are always going to have a problem with credibility. EOS BOS They have no credibility whatsoever. EOS BOS They always wait until the last second to act. EOS BOS Then, they take us for fools. EOS BOS The Conservatives have still not provided a shred of evidence to support their claims on this issue. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is known for micromanaging his government, yet, the Conservatives now expect us to believe that he knew nothing about the schemes concocted by his chief of staff and his lawyer, Benjamin Perrin. EOS BOS Come on. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives really saying that this complex scheme was carried out without the Prime Minister knowing anything about it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have stood in this place and I have answered the question categorically as to when the Prime Minister was made aware of this issue. I could not be any clearer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is clear now that the Conservative government under the Prime Minister has lost its moral compass. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's right-hand man secretly paid a parliamentarian $90,000 to obstruct an audit. EOS BOS Canadians deserve better. EOS BOS They deserve actual transparency and accountability. EOS BOS What precisely was the secret deal that the Prime Minister's Office made with Senator Duffy? EOS BOS Show us the documents. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have said it before and I will say it again. The Prime Minister was not aware of the payment until last week when reports surfaced in the media. EOS BOS Our understanding is there is no document. EOS BOS Again, I am very happy to have responded to both questions the member asked. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is in it up to his neck, and the members opposite know it. EOS BOS [Translation]It is now clear that the government has lost its moral compass under this Prime Minister. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's right-hand man made a secret $90,000 deal with a parliamentarian in order to obstruct an audit. EOS BOS Canadians are demanding real transparency. EOS BOS I am going to repeat my question: what precisely was the secret deal that the Prime Minister's Office made with Senator Duffy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister obviously not having known of the payment could not know about any alleged agreement to which the leader of the third party refers. EOS BOS This matter has been referred to two independent bodies that will review it. EOS BOS We look forward to hearing their comments following. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians work hard and play by the rules. EOS BOS They pay their own debts. EOS BOS Apparently, when the Conservatives break the rules, they get their debts secretly paid off by their friends in high places. EOS BOS It boggles the mind. EOS BOS Nobody over there even thinks anybody did anything wrong except get caught. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives release this secret document, allow for a full investigation and, while they are at it, apologize to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with respect to a legal agreement to which the member opposite refers, our understanding is there is no such agreement. EOS BOS This issue has been referred to two independent authorities that will look into the matter. EOS BOS We look forward to them reporting back to Parliament and to Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we now learn that the Prime Minister's key legal adviser, Benjamin Perrin, helped Nigel Wright with this secret deal that included a $90,000 payout and a promise to have Conservative senators “go easy” on Mike Duffy's rip-off of the taxpayer. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has praised Mike Duffy for leadership, he has praised Wright for being honourable, but he has not come clean with the Canadian people. EOS BOS Who else was involved in this plan to obstruct the audit? EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister think that it is okay for taxpayer-funded lawyers to obstruct investigations into taxpayer rip-offs? EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister have a problem with that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. EOS BOS No taxpayer money was involved with respect to this reimbursement. EOS BOS It is clear from the committee's report over in the other place that these expenses should not have been claimed. EOS BOS The government and no one in this caucus is disputing that fundamental fact. EOS BOS On Sunday, Mr. Wright took the responsible decision and tendered his resignation,  and that resignation was immediately accepted. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with answers like that, it is like the Conservatives are taking their crisis management courses from Rob Ford. EOS BOS We are talking about abuse of the public trust here. EOS BOS Today, the Prime Minister blew off the Nigel Wright scandal as a mere distraction, but he failed to tell Canadians whether he thought it was wrong or illegal, wrong to make secret payouts, wrong to obstruct an investigation. EOS BOS The Prime Minister called in the cops on Helena Guergis and Bruce Carson. EOS BOS Given the seriousness of these allegations, will he call in the cops against Nigel Wright and Mike Duffy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me once again be very clear. EOS BOS This issue has already been referred to two independent authorities that will appropriately look into this matter and report back to Parliament and to Canadians. EOS BOS This government looks forward to the findings of those two independent reports. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice may be aware that section 16 of the Parliament of Canada Act states that every person who gives, offers or promises to any member of the Senate any compensation for services relating to a proceeding, contract, claim or controversy before the Senate is guilty of an indictable offence. EOS BOS Does the Minister of Justice believe the PM's former chief of staff may have committed this crime when he gave Senator Duffy $90,000 as part of a cover-up deal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, it will come as no surprise to my colleague, the member opposite, that I reject much of the premise of his preamble. EOS BOS Let me just say this. EOS BOS The Prime Minister was not aware of this reimbursement until after it became public through media reports. EOS BOS The chief of staff has tendered his resignation. EOS BOS There are two independent authorities looking into this matter. EOS BOS We will allow them the time to do their work and we will await their findings. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to try again with the Minister of Justice. EOS BOS Let us remind ourselves that the PMO handed out $90,000 to keep a senator quiet. EOS BOS We have another provision that is relevant. EOS BOS Section 119 of the Criminal Code states that any person who offers an office holder any money, valuable consideration or employment in respect of anything done or omitted by that person in their official capacity is guilty of an offence. EOS BOS Does the minister agree that the Prime Minister's former chief of staff may have committed this crime? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, I reject much of the premise of the question from the member opposite. EOS BOS Let me say a number of things. EOS BOS One, the Prime Minister became aware of this issue last week after media reports surfaced. EOS BOS Right now, there are two independent authorities looking into this matter. EOS BOS Let us give them the opportunity to do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, either the Prime Minister knew that a report on his caucus members was coming and that his chief of staff had arranged a secret $90,000 deal to let Senator Duffy off the hook, or the Prime Minister knowingly chose to ignore the information. EOS BOS It is either a cover-up or incompetence. EOS BOS We all know that the Prime Minister is a control freak. EOS BOS This story reeks of cover-up. EOS BOS Could we at least know when the Prime Minister was informed of the content of the report? EOS BOS At that point, what directives were given? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the other place had auditors come in. EOS BOS A committee of that place looked into this matter. EOS BOS It came to the conclusion that these expenses should not have been claimed. EOS BOS No one in this government believes these expenses should have been claimed,  and that undoubtedly reflects the conclusion of the report at the end of the day. EOS BOS I understand the report did reflect that a reimbursement had been made, which was obviously factual. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in a one-year period, the Prime Minister has lost three ministers, two senators and one chief of staff to scandals. EOS BOS The Conservatives promised to clean house in Ottawa, but it turns out that they are just as crooked as the Liberals before them. EOS BOS The only way for the Conservatives to get out of this is to start telling the truth instead of claiming in unison that they are upset. EOS BOS Nigel Wright must explain his actions. EOS BOS Senator Duffy must disclose what was in that secret deal. EOS BOS Canadians deserve to know the whole truth. EOS BOS Will the government help us shed light on this scandal or will it keep pressing on without answering any questions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in this place, I have answered the questions that the members opposite have put forward. EOS BOS There are two independent authorities that are looking into this matter. EOS BOS Let us give them the time to do that work. EOS BOS We look forward to their findings. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again the Liberals are over-promising and underdelivering, with prairie farmers being their latest casualty. EOS BOS When asked if farmers' shipping rights will be protected under the law, the minister dismissed them by saying “no comment”. EOS BOS If they expire or if the Liberals refuse to make these protections permanent, farmers will be railroaded. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Transport end his obvious uninterest in the concerns of our western Canadian farmers and introduce legislation that protects their shipping rights? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been working very hard with the Minister of Agriculture in the past year with respect to our grain farmers. EOS BOS They represent an important part of our economy, and I want to thank them for it. EOS BOS I have been meeting with them and with the shippers and the railways in order to modernize our great rail legislation. EOS BOS Grain represents 10% of what our railways transport. EOS BOS It is extremely important, and we will be coming forward shortly with modern freight rail legislation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, when caught misusing taxpayers dollars, the Prime Minister's friends, Gerry and Katie, said that when they reviewed their expenses, they found that there were some that were unreasonable. EOS BOS The government continued to say that it was following the rules and was forced to make these payouts because of the rules, but in fact, the senior vice-president at Brookfield Global Relocation Services said just minutes ago that they were not forced to do this. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, they would have been briefed on the exact expenses they themselves were claiming. EOS BOS The question is, did Gerry and Katie believe that these expenses were unreasonable when they claimed them or only when they got caught? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to answer the member's question, and I will quote once again from Guy Giorno, former chief of staff to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS The relocation process is run by an independent third party. EOS BOS The third party determines the actual cost according to the program criteria.... EOS BOS There's a reason the system has an independent third party decide on actual costs and apply the rules fairly and consistently to everyone. EOS BOS Do we want a fair and independent determination based on consistent rules, or do we want [the hon. EOS BOS member for Saskatoon—University] to impose his arbitrary and personal opinion on”— EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have been clear. EOS BOS They want their government to make decisions that will lead to more choice, lower prices and better service in the wireless sector. EOS BOS For new wireless companies to be able to compete and provide choice to Canadians, spectrum is essential. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Industry please update the House on how last week's AWS-3 spectrum auction will deliver more choice for consumers in the wireless market? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as everything in our lives from academic pursuits to our digital economy continues to grow, the demand for wireless spectrum is only going to continue to be a demand for Canadians. EOS BOS Canadians want the latest and best technology, including fast download speeds, in all areas of the country. EOS BOS Our spectrum policy has resulted in more spectrum being put into the hands of the marketplace to benefit consumers than has happened with any government before in Canada's history. EOS BOS Better than that, when we formed government, less than 2% of all wireless spectrum was in the hands of wireless service providers other than the big three. EOS BOS Now more than a quarter of all wireless spectrum is going to be in the hands of competitors, which will drive down prices and create more choice for Canadian consumers. EOS BOS It is a big win for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem is not overcapacity. EOS BOS The problem is being able to export our products to the United States. EOS BOS There is another unsustainable sector: dairy production. EOS BOS For a long time now, dairy producers have been calling on the Liberal government to solve the diafiltered milk problem. EOS BOS Losses are adding up to millions of dollars per week. EOS BOS It is getting harder and harder for dairy producers, and it is all because the processing industry has very little respect for its partners who produce milk. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food show us that he is taking this problem seriously? EOS BOS Instead of just talking about international trade, can he come up with solutions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS The minister and I have both been dairy producers, and my son represents the fifth generation working for the business. EOS BOS We are aware of what farms contribute to regional economies. EOS BOS We are working with the industry to come up with a long-term solution, not a short-term one. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a court case in Vancouver is shaking residential school survivors' trust in our judicial system. EOS BOS While the facts of the case are before the courts, nearly 1,400 survivors' claims are sitting in limbo while the deadline for the independent assessment process fast approaches. EOS BOS What is the minister going to do to make sure that these survivors are not victimized once again? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this issue is before the courts. EOS BOS This process is one where we have advertised the upcoming expiry date, the final date for application. EOS BOS That message has reached over 95% of the potential claimants. EOS BOS In terms of where we go from here, this is a multi-party activity that will have to occur. EOS BOS We will have to wait for the courts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are coming up to the anniversary of the apology, and residential school survivors need more action from the government. EOS BOS The situation is deteriorating so badly that the Assembly of First Nations is asking for an eminent survivor to be appointed to restore faith in the judicial process. EOS BOS With the deadline fast approaching and many survivors' claims still waiting to be processed, what will the minister do to help residential school survivors before that deadline? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, any claimant who puts in a claim before the expiry date this fall will be processed, no matter how long that processing goes beyond that date. EOS BOS If somebody misses that date for extraordinary circumstances, we have provisions whereby we will certainly be cognizant of and sensitive to that. EOS BOS This worked for the comprehensive claims process, and I think it will work for the independent assessment process as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, instead of making progress and creating jobs by supporting clean energy industries, as everyone else in the world is doing, Canada is lagging behind. EOS BOS The only plan this government has is to go to the climate change conference in Durban and sabotage the discussions. EOS BOS Our partners are already shutting us out because of this out-of-touch government's policies. EOS BOS What is the government waiting for to come up with a policy centred on the green economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member finally understands that her party is vulnerable because it is fighting a major job creating project. EOS BOS She is now claiming, incredibly, that blocking Keystone would be good for Canadian jobs. EOS BOS That is like saying blocking the export of grain would be good for Canadian jobs because there is employment in baking bread. EOS BOS In fact, the oil sands will generate 500,000 jobs, including union jobs, and trillions of dollars of economic activity. EOS BOS Is there not at least one leadership contender who will take the side of Canadian workers? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, someone needs to press reset. EOS BOS That was not exactly a winning answer, I will give the Minister of the Environment kudos for one win that he has had on the environment file. EOS BOS For the third straight day, Canada received a fossil award as the country that has done the most to block progress on climate change. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear!Ms. EOS BOS Megan Leslie: EOS BOS It is unbelievable that they are applauding that. EOS BOS Even China is now saying that Canada pulling out of Kyoto will mess up the negotiations. EOS BOS Conservative inaction is— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Halifax has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservative inaction is killing Canadian jobs. EOS BOS When will the government finally commit to working on a plan with the world community on a plan for the new energy economy of the future? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada is indeed working toward a single new international climate change regime that will include all major emitters, including China. EOS BOS The Cancun agreements, based on the Copenhagen accords, provide a solid foundation for such a regime, and in Durban our Canadian delegation will work to implement these agreements. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, truckers at Port Metro Vancouver are still on the picket line. EOS BOS This is the largest port in Canada, handling billions of dollars' worth of goods. EOS BOS Truckers are frustrated. EOS BOS Local businesses are upset. EOS BOS Even warehouses are handing out pink slips. EOS BOS The prairie farmers are suffering. EOS BOS Yet, the Minister of Transport prefers threats to rolling up her sleeves and getting a deal done. EOS BOS Will the minister finally agree to sit down with the truckers and all involved to get a deal done? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, indeed, it is a serious situation at the Port Metro Vancouver. EOS BOS It is our most important port on the west coast, and that is why we have invested $1.4 billion in it to make sure the Asia Pacific gateway works well. EOS BOS To this point, we are working with our partners, the British Columbia government and Port Metro Vancouver. EOS BOS I am in constant contact with both the chair of the port and Minister Stone on this matter. EOS BOS We want to ensure that we have optimal service at the port of Vancouver. EOS BOS Our 14-point plan is there, and the parties are at the table at this moment discussing how to return to work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, ISIL terrorists are creating chaos in the Middle East and inciting violence that has sadly reached us on home soil. EOS BOS Canada has joined our international partners in providing military assistance and humanitarian aid to stop the further spread of ISIL and to ensure the humanitarian crisis does not worsen. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs please update the House on how Canada continues to work with our allies to stop the lSIL terrorists? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously working on a combat mission with the United States is an important part of the attack on terrorism in Iraq and the threat that is posed by ISIL.One of the other things that Canada and the international community can do is to clamp down on the financing of such terrorism. EOS BOS This government, through listing terrorist organizations, has done a lot in recent years. EOS BOS An international conference will be held on November 9 in Manama, Bahrain, to look at what we can do to work together to attack the financing of ISIL. EOS BOS That is another example of this government getting tough on terrorism. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier this week at committee, I asked the Minister of Environment and Climate Change about Canada's competitive advantage in carbon pricing. EOS BOS The only response I could get was that China was considering a plan to price carbon and that this was a game changer. EOS BOS Therefore, we are left with a minister who turns to China for inspiration on carbon taxes, and a Prime Minister who expresses admiration for the basic dictatorship that is China. EOS BOS When will the Liberals abandon their plan for a carbon-tax grab and focus on supporting Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's government is working actively with the provinces and territories to develop and implement a Canadian plan to reduce emissions and to further the clean-growth economy. EOS BOS We welcome the discussion with respect to carbon pricing. EOS BOS Carbon pricing is something that will be part of the outcome of the discussions. EOS BOS I would say that the hon. EOS BOS member should actually have a conversation with some of the leading Conservative members around the country, including Patrick Brown, the leader of the Ontario Conservative Party; Preston Manning; and Mark Cameron, who was an advisor to his former prime minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not only about a carbon-tax grab. EOS BOS Earlier this week in question period, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change was asked when she would make a decision on the $36 billion Pacific NorthWest LNG project in B.C. She flippantly said, “ EOS BOS We will make a decision when we are ready to make a decision”.When will the minister abandon her plan for a harmful carbon-tax grab, get out of the way, and allow Canada's resources to be shipped to market? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been very clear that we will be working to ensure that the economy and the environment go hand in hand. EOS BOS We have also been very clear that we are going to base decisions on science and evidence. EOS BOS With respect to Pacific NorthWest, as I have mentioned to my hon. EOS BOS colleague in the past, the proponent provided substantive new information during the public comment period, some of which had the potential to have impact on the second largest salmon run in British Columbia. EOS BOS We are going through the process of assessing that information to ensure that we understand the environmental impacts. EOS BOS That is the responsible thing to do. EOS BOS That is what we plan to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, mining is the biggest provider of jobs in the north. EOS BOS The recent downturn in the natural resource sector had disastrous effects on each of the territories. EOS BOS Unemployment is now 6.9% in the Yukon, 9.4% in the Northwest Territories, and a staggering 16.2% in Nunavut. EOS BOS A carbon tax will only make things worse. EOS BOS When will the Liberals realize that a carbon tax will only weaken the northern economy and raise unemployment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in an earlier reply, we are working actively with all of the provinces and territories across the country to develop a pan-Canadian approach to address carbon emissions and to actually promote a clean-growth economy. EOS BOS We intend to work constructively with all provinces and territories to ensure that we have a plan that has the support of all parts of the country, but will allow us to ensure that we are addressing what is a critical international issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, northerners want to work and support their families. EOS BOS Instead of embracing the resource industry, the Liberals have taken every opportunity to give it the cold shoulder. EOS BOS They are making it more difficult for the natural resource industry in the north by introducing a carbon tax that will raise the cost on everything. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals kicking northerners down when the economy is already down? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer my hon. colleague to a number of elements in the budget which focus on innovation and driving clean technology into sectors such as the mining industry, to enable the mining industry to become more carbon friendly, but also more productive and more efficient. EOS BOS I would also note that people like Pierre Gratton, the CEO of the Mining Association of Canada, last week came out and actively supported carbon pricing as part of the overall solution. EOS BOS In fact, people in industries from oil and gas, to mining, to other industrial sectors have joined the modern age and understand that carbon pricing is part of what we must do in order to meet carbon emission targets and to ensure that we have a clean growth economy in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has introduced the respect for communities act, which gives local community residents as well as community leaders and police a say when drug injection houses want to open. EOS BOS This is needed and reasonable consideration that should be given, yet this bill continues to be opposed by Liberal MPs and senators. EOS BOS All the while, the Liberal leader is calling for more drug injection houses to open across the country. EOS BOS I would like the Minister of Health to please update this House on where this important bill is at. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this Conservative government has a strong record of keeping our streets and communities safe from dangerous and addictive drugs, and we will continue to support treatment and recovery programs that actually work to get addicts off drugs and help them recover drug-free lives. EOS BOS The Liberal leader's pledge to blindly open drug injection houses in neighbourhoods is a disturbing and a risky proposal, and as Minister of Health, I will make sure that communities are consulted before any of these open up. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for years New Democrats have stood in this chamber and asked the government to take action on credit card merchant fees—fees that are the highest in the world, fees that the Competition Tribunal found were anti-competitive and excessive, fees that raise prices for consumers and hold small businesses back—yet for years the government has done nothing. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us when he will finally act and introduce mandatory regulations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is working with stakeholders on a voluntary approach to reduce credit fees for merchants while encouraging them to lower prices for consumers. EOS BOS We also heard the concerns of small business and introduced a code of conduct. EOS BOS The code has been welcomed by consumers and by industry groups, especially small businesses. EOS BOS However, the NDP voted against the code and against supporting small businesses and consumers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after promising to curb the greed of credit card companies that impose abusive fees on merchants and therefore consumers, the Conservatives have now reversed that decision and are proposing a voluntary code. EOS BOS Once again, the Conservatives are favouring the credit card companies instead of defending small business owners and consumers. EOS BOS Does the minister really believe that credit card companies will suddenly stop abusing their monopoly voluntarily? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP always wants more legislation and higher fees for Canadians. EOS BOS Our government is working with stakeholders on a voluntary approach to reduce credit fees for merchants while encouraging them to lower prices for consumers. EOS BOS This is the right way to proceed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the Prime Minister is using official government business in Washington to raise money for the Liberal Party, there is a serious international matter involving Canadians abroad that demands his attention. EOS BOS John Ridsdel and Robert Hall are two Canadians who have been held hostage in the Philippines by the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. EOS BOS Yesterday, a video emerged of the two of them having their lives threatened, and in the video both men specifically asked the government to act. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell the House what the Canadian government is actually doing to help free these men from their terrorist captors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is aware of the video that has been released. EOS BOS Our priority is the safety of our citizens, and that is precisely why we will not comment on anything that this government is doing right now. EOS BOS Our priority is the safety of Canadians, but we are on top of that file. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we all know that the NDP government of 2015 will defend both consumers and SMEs, of course. EOS BOS The Canada Revenue Agency recognizes that its letters are so complicated and so poorly written, that often taxpayers do not know whether to write a cheque or wait for a refund. EOS BOS It is a mystery. EOS BOS Ultimately, this mismanagement leaves Canadians confused and paying penalties. EOS BOS Will the government move quickly to correct the situation, reassure Canadians, and finally provide adequate service? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, regarding the recommendations referred to by the hon. member, this was an evaluation that was initiated by the agency. EOS BOS It was done to keep it accountable and ensure services to Canadians are constantly improving. EOS BOS The agency regularly receives feedback on communications. EOS BOS Clarity is essential. EOS BOS These recommendations will lead to change and improve services for all Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS We are taking action. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, things have gotten so bad at the Canada Revenue Agency that people cannot even understand the letters it is sending out. EOS BOS Just think about that. EOS BOS The letters are so poorly written that fully one-half of the people who receive them do not know what to do when they get them. EOS BOS Would the Minister of National Revenue explain why she spent over $100,000 on consultants to figure out that this might be a problem, and what she intends to do to fix it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am a strong believer in plain language. EOS BOS As I said, clarity is essential in communications. EOS BOS This third-party evaluation was initiated by CRA as part of our effort to provide critical input into reducing red tape and to support taxpayers in compliance. EOS BOS The CRA is aligning with best practices for effective correspondence. EOS BOS We are taking action now. EOS BOS That action was started before this evaluation. EOS BOS It continues now through these recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as we welcome our Olympic athletes here today, the only medal that government over there deserves is a medal for the worst public administration. EOS BOS The Liberals promised a $10-billion deficit, which was already pretty huge, but now it looks like it could be double or even triple that amount by the end of the fiscal year. EOS BOS Furthermore, the government does not have a plan for returning to a balanced budget. EOS BOS Why is there no plan for returning to a balanced budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am confident that Canadian families who have benefited from the Canada child benefit and a tax cut would give us a gold medal, because they now have more money in their pockets. EOS BOS We started with a very important first step: making life better for Canadian families now. EOS BOS This means that we can now focus on investing in the future for their children and grandchildren. EOS BOS That is what the program we announced yesterday is all about, and we are implementing that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my former colleague, Jim Flaherty, was once named the best finance minister in the world. I cannot wait to see who will be named next. EOS BOS The only medal our children might get is a medal for hope, because they will be the ones left to pay off the Liberal deficit for generations to come. EOS BOS We will never see the end of this story. EOS BOS Why is there no plan for returning to a balanced budget? EOS BOS Canadians cannot trust this Prime Minister. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the economic statement we delivered yesterday, because we explained to Canadians how we are going to improve their situation with our plan for economic growth. EOS BOS It is very important. EOS BOS We are going to make investments in infrastructure to stimulate our economy and create more jobs and future opportunities for young people and future generations. EOS BOS It is an important plan for the future of Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the Minister of Democratic Institutions was informed of the government's decision to break its promise just one day before she was forced to announce it. EOS BOS The Prime Minister did not make the announcement himself. EOS BOS He hid behind his new minister. EOS BOS He refused to take responsibility for his deceit. EOS BOS I have a very specific question for the Prime Minister: When exactly did he decide to break his promise? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to taking responsibility, everyone knows that it is in the mandate letters, which are available to the public on the website. EOS BOS These letters from the Prime Minister to the ministers explain what they will be responsible for during their time in office. EOS BOS It is very clear, it is transparent, it is open, and my signature is on every single mandate letter. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the only problem is that this particular letter was well hidden. EOS BOS The minister herself had to unveil it once it was clear that the Prime Minister had broken his promise. EOS BOS [English]
              The Prime Minister said just a few weeks ago, “I've heard loudly and clearly that Canadians want a better system of...choosing our governments”. EOS BOS It sounds like consensus to me. EOS BOS He also said, “I make promises because I believe in them”. EOS BOS It is more like he makes promises when they help him win an election. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister apologize to Canadians for so blatantly misleading them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have been clear that they want improvements to our democracy, and that is exactly what we are working on, whether it is protecting political parties or political systems from cybersecurity threats, whether it is ensuring better transparency around fundraising, or whether it is improving by undoing changes made by the previous government that make it harder for Canadians to vote. EOS BOS There are many things we are working on to improve our democracy, and that is what Canadians expect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the 39th, 40th and again in this 41st Parliament, this party has tabled legislation, the climate change accountability act, that would commit Canada to emission reduction targets. EOS BOS That is a consistent determination to preserve this planet for our kids. EOS BOS Contrast that with a Prime Minister who once called meeting emission targets “an important objective”, but now, having missed every target, he calls emission regulation “crazy”. EOS BOS How did it happen that the Prime Minister's once important objective became crazy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, what it crazy is a job-killing carbon tax. EOS BOS Our government is the government that is reducing emissions, while supporting economic growth and job creation. EOS BOS We are achieving this without the crazy policies of the NDP.In 2012, greenhouse gas emissions were 5.1% lower than the 2005 levels, while the economy grew by 10.6% during the same period. EOS BOS Canada's 2020 greenhouse gas emissions are projected to be 130 megatonnes lower than they would have been under the Liberals. EOS BOS That is real leadership. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, because the Conservatives refuse to regulate the oil and gas sector, other sectors will have to do more if we are to meet our targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS The manufacturing sector, for example, which has already come a long way, will have to make up for the Conservatives' favouritism toward the oil companies. EOS BOS How does the Prime Minister justify the fact that other sectors have to pay the bill for the oil and gas sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's record is clear. We have taken decisive action on the environment while protecting our economy. EOS BOS We will continue to implement the sector-by-sector regulatory approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that protects the environment and supports economic prosperity. EOS BOS Building on these actions, we recently announced that we will be taking action to limit the growth HFCs, which are the most potent and fastest-growing greenhouse gases in the world, and we will do that without putting economic penalties on our oil and gas sector and without a job-killing carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with regard to the sector-by-sector approach, oil and gas is the sector with the biggest GHG emissions, and there is no way for Canada to meet its obligations without regulating that sector. EOS BOS The Prime Minister says he wants to align Canada's oil and gas rights with the U.S., but neither the minister nor the parliamentary secretary could say if he has proposed continent-wide regulations to the Americans. EOS BOS Therefore, I will ask again: what regulations has the government proposed to the United States? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said, the Prime Minister said Canada would not take unilateral action and impose taxes and monetary penalties on the oil and gas sector, but what the opposition has said is it would impose taxes and monetary penalties on the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS The opposition also said it would act unilaterally to impose a job-killing carbon tax. EOS BOS The opposition parties would gamble with 275,000 jobs in Canada. EOS BOS Our government is not going to do that. EOS BOS We are going to support hard-working Canadians, and we are going to do that without the crazy taxes of the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last month I had the opportunity to announce $4.84 million for the Bioenterprise Corporation in Guelph. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development please inform the House about this exciting new investment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Guelph for his question and his continued effort to raise the business needs of his riding. EOS BOS Guelph and the surrounding region is a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship, and this investment of $4.84 million to Bioenterprise is a prime example of our commitment to cultivating and encouraging creativity, invention, and collaboration. EOS BOS I am proud to say that budget 2016 focuses on expanding our start-ups and strengthening our innovation clusters to help create opportunities for long-term development and sustainable economic growth. EOS BOS It is about growing the economy and creating jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night the 90-foot vessel, the Anapaya, sank in Ladysmith Harbour, leaking oil into the ocean. EOS BOS In 2014, Transport Canada identified this 100-year old boat as a vessel of concern. EOS BOS The government knew it posed a threat. EOS BOS However, it took no action until it sank. EOS BOS We are grateful for the Coast Guard's swift action. EOS BOS However, this is yet another example of the Liberal government's failed boat-by-boat approach on abandoned vessels. EOS BOS Why did the government do nothing to prevent this vessel sinking, and will the government support my legislation to solve abandoned vessels once and for all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of having announced the oceans protection plan. EOS BOS In relation to vessels of concern, we announced the $6.8 million abandoned boats program last May. We also announced a small craft harbour federal fisheries boat cleanup program. EOS BOS We will be acceding to the Nairobi protocol, and later this year we will be introducing legislation dealing with vessels of concern. EOS BOS I think we are covering the waterfront. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the people of Fort McMurray are wondering when they can return to their homes, or what is left of them. EOS BOS They want to go back to their jobs if they still have them. EOS BOS Oil companies have cut production, small businesses have shut down and self-employed contractors are left wondering what is next. EOS BOS While the premier is meeting with oil companies today to discuss getting production back online, the Minister of Natural Resources is “having conversations in Ottawa”. EOS BOS When will Albertans see real support for energy sector workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, over the last 24 hours I have had conversations with the ministers of forestry and energy in the government of Alberta, and I have spoken to several chief executive officers of major oil companies in Fort McMurray. EOS BOS They all report how satisfied they have been with the co-operation of governments and industry to ensure that people have been returned to their homes safety, and miraculously that is the case. EOS BOS They also report to me that production is now restarting , and they expect it will be done in an orderly and timely way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, the oil sands companies, workers and all the people around Fort McMurray and across Alberta have done amazing work to support them during this tragedy. EOS BOS It could be weeks or months before residents of Fort McMurray can get home and get back to work. EOS BOS They have shown they are “Alberta strong”, but that does not pay the bills. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Minister of Natural Resources said that his government was, “responding to that reality”. EOS BOS Could the minister tell Canadians exactly how the government has responded to the job losses caused by the fire? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have responded in the first place in the most important of all ways, and that is to guarantee the safety of those who were evacuated from their homes, to minimize damage to infrastructure and to keep an ongoing conversation with those who are running these industries to ensure their infrastructure is protected so that when this tragic incident passes, we will be well-positioned to rebuild the sector, which is in the interest of all members of the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today the Parliamentary Budget Officer released a report looking into the impact of our government's family tax cut and enhanced universal child care benefit. EOS BOS Can the Minister of State for Social Development please update this House on the PBO' s findings for our proposed changes and what our government has done to help parents meet their child care needs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Mississauga South for that question and for the great work she does on behalf of Canadian families. EOS BOS Today, the PBO confirmed that 100% of families with children will benefit from our family tax cut and benefit package, regardless of their choice of child care. EOS BOS The PBO said, “ EOS BOS The introduction of the [universal child care benefit] greatly increased the level of benefits” to families. EOS BOS In fact, thanks to our Conservative government, he said that the “total federal spending on child care nearly quadrupled”.While the opposition votes against the UCCB, we will keep putting money in the pockets of families. EOS
BOS I draw the attention of hon. EOS BOS members to the presence in the gallery of the Honourable Blaine Pedersen, Minister of Growth, Enterprise and Trade for the Province of Manitoba. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS Now I believe the House leader for the official opposition has the usual Thursday question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the F-35 is probably the biggest procurement fiasco in the history of Canada. EOS BOS There was no bidding process to buy the jet, which does not even work. EOS BOS And even if it did work, it would not meet the criteria set by the government. EOS BOS Then there is the $47,000 photo op with the full-scale model. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence is responsible for this failure. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister clean up this mess over the summer by replacing the Minister of National Defence with someone who can do the job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has not yet purchased the F-35. EOS BOS On the contrary, we have said many times that we will replace the jets when necessary, at the end of this decade. EOS BOS Now, we are in the process of rebuilding the Canadian armed forces. EOS BOS It is very important to give our men and women in uniform the equipment they need. EOS BOS I am very proud of our government's track record on this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in Canada, there are at least 235,000 homeless people. EOS BOS According to a report on the state of homelessness in Canada published today, with little effort we could practically eliminate homelessness. EOS BOS It is time for the federal government to stop withdrawing support for social housing and start funding new units. EOS BOS To govern is to make choices. EOS BOS When will the government truly make social housing a priority? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government renewed our homelessness partnering strategy with a focus on Housing First, which is an evidence-based model that takes those who are chronically homeless out of this situation. EOS BOS Experts across the country have lauded our approach. EOS BOS In fact, the most recent report on homelessness said that the federal government's shift to focus on Housing First is a transformational change to Canada's response to homelessness. EOS BOS We will continue to use evidence-based facts. EOS BOS The NDP unfortunately opposes that approach. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact is that federal investment in housing has declined by 46% over the last 25 years, leading to a shrinking supply of affordable housing. EOS BOS Communities and municipalities are struggling to meet the demand for affordable housing, which is essential to ending homelessness in Canada. EOS BOS Why will the Conservatives not restore long-term housing funding to address Canada's growing homelessness and housing crisis? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, together with our homelessness partnering strategy, we also are investing in affordable housing with the provinces. EOS BOS With our partners, we have helped almost one million individuals and families with affordable housing. EOS BOS We know that the NDP wants to create big, bureaucratic Ottawa programs to increase taxes on Canadians. EOS BOS We are going to make smart investments. EOS BOS We are going to work together with provinces and municipalities. EOS BOS We will address these issues not with big programs but smart investments. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the decision of the Liberals to increase the small business tax rate is proving worse and worse. EOS BOS Last week, I asked why the Liberals broke their promise to our small businesses. EOS BOS This broken promise will cost the industry $2.2billion. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals continue to abandon our hard-working small business owners? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on January 1, the tax rate for small businesses was reduced. EOS BOS Today the parliamentary budget officer confirmed that the decision to maintain the reduced business tax rate was the right one. EOS BOS The report confirmed that the previous government's approach would have created just over 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost $2.1 billion to the economy with no growth to the economy. EOS BOS It is important that we support our small and medium-sized businesses. EOS BOS I am here to ensure they are productive, more innovative and export oriented. EOS BOS We will continue to do the work we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I wish Liberals understood small businesses, but the facts just do not support that. EOS BOS A report from the parliamentary budget officer today indicated that in addition to the $2.2 billion cost to the industry, the changes to the small business tax rate would actually cost jobs. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop punishing small businesses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the budget officer for offering his projections to Canadians and parliamentarians. EOS BOS In a previous report, the budget officer's verdict was that our budget as a whole would have significant positive impact on the Canadian economy and create tens of thousands of jobs. EOS BOS As a whole, budget 2016 proposes targeted investments, totalling $50.2 billion. EOS BOS Small business is implicit throughout the entire budget. EOS BOS Small businesses are the backbone of the economy. EOS BOS They are our job creators, and we support small business. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives disrespected Parliament through their use of omnibus bills and the Liberals rightly joined New Democrats to decry them, but yesterday, the Liberals tabled an omnibus budget bill of their own. EOS BOS The bill runs more than 170 pages and includes a bill that is already before the House. EOS BOS It also contains the Liberals' inadequate EI changes that will leave most Canadians out. EOS BOS Are the Liberals really using omnibus bills like the Conservatives did to avoid proper scrutiny from Parliament? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our budget implementation act is absolutely not an omnibus bill. EOS BOS Every measure in the budget implementation act is related to our budget, unlike previous omnibus bills from the members opposite, who put in things like the repeal of the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act in 2012, or gutted the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act in 2010. EOS BOS We will continue on our message that our budget implementation act is about budget measures and budget measures only. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem is that, as members will recall, the Conservatives used their budget implementation bill to amend dozens of bills, and the Liberals are doing the same thing. EOS BOS The Conservatives made retroactive changes to other laws, and the Liberals are doing the same thing. EOS BOS As my colleague mentioned, entire bills that had been introduced in the House were inserted into this bill. EOS BOS The problem is that the Liberal government promised to be more transparent and to do things differently. EOS BOS In the interest of transparency, will the government agree to split the bill, so that it can be properly studied in committee? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to be clear. EOS BOS Our budget implementation act is in fact exactly that. EOS BOS It is a budget implementation act that includes budget measures and budget measures only. EOS BOS It is an act that shows Canadians in an open and transparent way the way that we are going to make a real difference in their lives both today and tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, although the Conservatives have decided to scrap their horrible Bill C-30 on Internet snooping, we wonder if they will manage to plant their controversial measures in another bill. EOS BOS Bill C-12 contains hidden measures that would allow the government to obtain personal information without judicial oversight. EOS BOS If the Conservatives are really serious about abandoning their Internet snooping bill, then why did they not withdraw Bill C-12 as well? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, Bill C-12 will better protect the personal information of consumers. EOS BOS We are trying to bolster consumer confidence in on-line shopping. EOS BOS Recommendations were made by the committee and we want to implement them quickly. EOS BOS If the NDP wants to vote immediately, we would be very pleased to move forward with this bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives intend to do nothing about tragedies like the case of Ashley Smith. EOS BOS Major changes need to be made to the RCMP to address the issue of harassment and bullying. EOS BOS Yesterday, the report released by the RCMP public complaints commission confirmed the need for an independent and more transparent process in which members of both the RCMP and the public can have confidence. EOS BOS Will the minister follow the zero tolerance recommendations of the commission in order to create a healthy working environment that is fair for everyone? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that hon. EOS BOS member is incorrect. EOS BOS We are all very concerned with what happened to Ashley Smith. EOS BOS It is despicable that she would have just made that comment. EOS BOS We never want to see that happen again. EOS BOS In regard to the report the member mentioned, the report came out yesterday from the Commission for Public Complaints, the independent commission. EOS BOS We appreciate that report. EOS BOS It is good to note that this report shows there are not systemic harassment issues within the RCMP, but any kind of harassment or bullying would never be tolerated and should not be tolerated within the RCMP.That is why we call on the opposition to support Bill C-42, which brings greater accountability and a process whereby the RCMP can deal with these kinds of issues. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a year ago, the Prime Minister tried to cover up details of his vacation on a billionaire's private island. EOS BOS Thanks to our leader, who demanded an investigation into the Prime Minister's illegal vacation, we all know that the Prime Minister contravened four sections of our conflict of interest and ethics legislation. EOS BOS Now the Prime Minister has to accept the consequences and prove to Canadians that he is following the same rules as every other member of the House. EOS BOS When will he pay back the $215,000 he took? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, immediately after the commissioner's report was released, the Prime Minister took responsibility, accepted the commissioner's findings, and committed to clearing all future personal and family vacation plans with the commissioner. EOS BOS For weeks and months, for a whole year even, the opposition demanded the report, and now that the report has been tabled, the opposition is refusing to accept the findings. EOS BOS We, in contrast, are grateful to the commissioner, we accept her findings, and we will follow all her recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all week now, we have been trying to get an answer from the Prime Minister, but he refuses to answer any questions himself. EOS BOS Meanwhile, the government House leader keeps reading from the same cue cards prepared by the Liberal spin doctors. EOS BOS It sounds like a broken record. EOS BOS Can the House leader put down her cue cards and simply tell Canadians whether the Prime Minister intends to pay back the $215,000 he picked from their pockets? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said several times, the previous commissioner, both in her report and in her testimony at committee, answered many questions related to her report. EOS BOS We accept her findings and we respect her work. EOS BOS Every day, the opposition members read the same question, and yet they tell me I should not read the same answer. EOS BOS Funny, is it not? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing is indeed quite funny. EOS BOS Based on what the House leader is saying, we are supposed to believe that the Prime Minister is above the law. EOS BOS The Prime Minister thinks that Canadians have one law for all other members of the House and another law that applies only to him. EOS BOS I would like to know why ministers who are caught red-handed have to pay back what they took, when the Prime Minister refuses to pay back the $215,000 he picked from the pockets of taxpayers— EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what I said is that, on this side of the House, we respect the work of all the other officers of Parliament. EOS BOS Unlike the opposition, when officers of Parliament make recommendations, we take them seriously, and we work with those officers to make sure that we are following their recommendations. EOS BOS What is more, the Prime Minister committed to having all future personal and family vacations cleared ahead of time. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have seen other Liberals, like the indigenous services minister, the member for Malpeque, and the member for Humber River—Black Creek, pay back taxpayers for inappropriate expenses that they claimed. EOS BOS That was the right thing to do. EOS BOS However, the Prime Minister thinks he does not have to pay back over $200,000 in illegal expenses that he charged. EOS BOS He thinks he is above the law and above the rules. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister think there is one set of rules for him, and another set of rules for everyone else? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on numerous occasions the Prime Minister and myself, and many others, have reiterated that immediately following the report being submitted we accepted the recommendations. EOS BOS The Prime Minister took responsibility. EOS BOS What is clear is that the Conservatives continue to focus on the Prime Minister. EOS BOS They continue to focus on us, while we will continue to focus on Canadians. EOS BOS Last night, once again, the Prime Minister was at a public town hall. EOS BOS He was hearing directly from Canadians. EOS BOS They were talking about the very real challenges they are facing, including immigration delays. EOS BOS While the Conservatives thought 24 months was adequate, we have reduced that to 12 months. EOS BOS We will continue getting— EOS </s> BOS The hon. opposition House leader. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are focused on the Prime Minister, because he is the only prime minister in the history of Canada to break the Conflict of Interest Act. EOS BOS Recently, the Prime Minister said that he believes the standard applied to others on the issue of sexual harassment applies to everyone, including himself. EOS BOS That, indeed, is true. EOS BOS Why is it that when it comes to paying back taxpayers' dollars, that the Prime Minister clearly should not have used and that is owed back, he thinks he does not have to pay. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister think the standard that is applied to everyone else in this place, when it comes to paying for illegal or improper expenses, does not apply to him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said, as has been the case for past prime ministers and as is the case for this Prime Minister, whenever and wherever the Prime Minister travels, there are costs related to security. EOS BOS Once the commissioner had submitted the report, the Prime Minister took responsibility. EOS BOS He accepted the recommendations. EOS BOS It is interesting, because the opposition, for weeks, months, a year even, was asking for that report to be submitted. EOS BOS Now that it is submitted, it is refusing to accept its findings. EOS BOS We respect the work of the commissioner. EOS BOS We respect the work of officers of Parliament, and we thank them for their work. EOS BOS We will accept their recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today we learned yet again of another act of barbarism committed by ISIL. EOS BOS In the town of Hit just west of Baghdad, 30 Sunni men were paraded through the city before being summarily executed by ISIL. EOS BOS Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident but another example of the brutality and inhumanity of ISIL that we have seen in the past few months. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration please comment on this latest incident? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the truth is that ISIL is conducting a campaign of unspeakable atrocities that represents a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria as well as Canada. EOS BOS In response to this threat, this government has introduced Bill C-44, which would strengthen the hand of our security agencies. EOS BOS We have passed the Combating Terrorism Act and we have introduced Canada's first strategy to address terrorism in all its forms. EOS BOS It is the responsibility of all of us in the House to protect Canadians and defend our citizens. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he keeps forgetting the four major pipelines that were approved by our government, and he forgets about the additional political hurdles he has added. 
							[ EOS BOS Translation]With regard to their trip to Washington, we know what they are saying and the messages that they are sending.We know that all bilateral meetings are important. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's priorities are what Canadians are concerned about. EOS BOS There was a limited number of seats at the table and he made sure to save spots for his in-laws and bagmen, but he left his Minister of Natural Resources at home. EOS BOS What role did his wife's parents and the party hacks play for him to think that it was more important for them to go on that trip than his own Minister of Natural Resources? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for 10 years, the former government wanted to talk to the United States about only one thing: pipelines. EOS BOS Unfortunately, that poisoned Canada's relationship with the United States. EOS BOS As a result, our economic growth, our relationship, and the work of our companies and entrepreneurs have suffered. EOS BOS The reality is that it has taken a lot of energy to rebuild that relationship. EOS BOS We put our hearts and souls into it, and I was touched by the fact that President Obama personally invited my mother and my in-laws to be part of this big family reunion, the reunion of two families— EOS
BOS The hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no one believes that President Obama, on his own, decided to invite the Prime Minister's in-laws. EOS BOS No one believes that President Obama, on his own, decided to invite Liberal Party fundraisers. EOS BOS Canadians know how these kinds of official events work. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister deny that it was his office that sent the White House the invitation list for the state dinner? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yet again, the party opposite has demonstrated it has very little understanding of the strong friendship between Canada and the United States. EOS BOS I can say, on top of the official delegation seats that we were allocated, the President and his office insisted that we add to it my mother and our in-laws, because it emphasizes the relationship. EOS BOS These were extra seats that the President made available. EOS BOS They were not in the official delegation that we provided. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Hon. members are enjoying this exchange. EOS BOS Let us ensure we can all, including the Speaker, hear both the questions and the answers, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, is the Prime Minister sure that they just added in his in-laws and did not just drop the natural resources minister to make room? EOS BOS It is not about whether some of these people paid back the cost of their flights; it is about the fact that they were there at all. EOS BOS For example, the Prime Minister's party fundraisers were granted privileged access to high-ranking U.S. officials. EOS BOS Now that is not a bad deal: repay the cost of a commercial flight and meet with connected Washington insiders. EOS BOS However, do members know who was not there in Washington? EOS BOS Do they know who was not there to promote his portfolio? EOS BOS Do they know who was not there at the table to promote Canadian businesses? EOS BOS It was the natural resources minister. EOS </s> BOS Yet again, Mr. Speaker, we see that the members opposite simply do not understand how important the relationship with the United States actually is. EOS BOS Working together across broad portfolios, creating the kinds of interactions and strength between our two countries that Canadians rely on every day to move goods and services across the border, to find markets for their produce and products, these are the things that for 10 years the members opposite failed to get done. EOS BOS That is why we are working hard to grow Canada's economy and friendship with the United States. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the decline of print media is hitting our regions hard. EOS BOS Back home, in Saguenay— EOS BOS Lac-Saint-Jean, ad revenue at newspapers like Le Quotidien and Le Progrès week-end is dwindling. EOS BOS Since the Liberal government claims to care about information, it must take action and support print media, just like it supported other industries in which so many jobs were at stake. EOS BOS Will the government commit to providing temporary financial assistance to print media and help maintain good jobs, while the industry awaits a permanent solution? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we understand how much Canadians rely on local media to read the local news that brings them together as a community EOS BOS .
              We will continue to spend millions of advertising dollars to support local newspapers. EOS BOS We recognize that the industry is going through a transformation. EOS BOS We will continue to support the media, because a democratic society needs strong, free media. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada continues to be a world leader in global health, especially in the fight against polio. EOS BOS Last week, at the global vaccine summit, the Minister of International Cooperation announced Canada's continued commitment to polio eradication. EOS BOS Bill Gates said, “Canada's increased support over the next six years will help ensure we can end polio and build the infrastructure needed to help all children live healthy and productive lives”.Could the Minister of International Cooperation please update the House on Canada's latest efforts to eradicate polio? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today we celebrated a final tally of $2.2 million raised by the Canadian Rotarians in support of global efforts to eradicate polio. EOS BOS The government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will match this initiative dollar for dollar. EOS BOS We also call on religious, government and community leaders to continue to promote scientific information and to condemn the violence against immunization workers. EOS BOS One thing is certain. EOS BOS Canada remains a leader in the effort to make polio history. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, troubling reports out of the United Kingdom indicate that a Canadian terror suspect is being pursued with respect to possible risks to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelling in India. EOS BOS I ask that the Minister of Public Safety update the House and confirm that CSIS and all of our security agencies are providing co-operation in this international investigation. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously I would not comment on any specific operational matter, but I can also confirm what the hon. EOS BOS gentleman implied in his question, that in circumstances where international co-operation is required, most certainly CSIS, the RCMP, the CBSA, and every agency under the authority of the Government of Canada, co-operate fully with our international partners. EOS
BOS I wish to draw the attention of members to the presence in the gallery of His Excellency Ivo Bischofberger, President of the Swiss Council of States. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS I would also like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of Her Excellency Laura Boldrini, President of the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Republic. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday UNICEF released a report showing that Canada's child poverty rate decreased during the recession, pulling nearly 180,000 children out of poverty. EOS BOS Could the Minister of State for Social Development please explain to the House what specific actions our government has taken to help lift children out of poverty? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is right. EOS BOS This is great news. EOS BOS During the recession, under our government's low-tax incentives and with support that goes directly to families, we have been able to pull 180,000 children out of poverty. EOS BOS Why is that? EOS BOS What UNICEF said is it is because of things such as our universal child care benefit and our tax incentives. EOS BOS Under our Prime Minister and our government, we will continue to put money back into the pockets of hard-working families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 14 mayors in my region have had enough of the Minister of Transport's inaction on the Sherbrooke airport file. EOS BOS They wrote to her to ask for security facilities at the Sherbrooke airport, which would stimulate economic development in my region by creating tens of millions of dollars in economic spinoffs. EOS BOS Unfortunately, she said no to all 14 elected officials in the region. EOS BOS There is a consensus and just one person is missing: the Minister of Transport. EOS BOS Why does she want to hinder Sherbrooke's economic development? EOS BOS Why is she abandoning Sherbrooke? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are 89 airports in this country that are already designated to receive services from CATSA. EOS BOS Sherbrooke is not one of them, but Sherbrooke is one of over 20 airports in this country that have had the same requests for the provision of these services. EOS BOS They all go through the same process. EOS BOS It is reviewed by my officials, who are in contact with the various airports around the country with respect to this. EOS BOS However, I want to be clear: we are not expanding this list of 89 airports. EOS BOS Anything moving forward would have to be discussed specifically with CATSA and Transport Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the first week of February is Eating Disorder Awareness Week. EOS BOS Between 2% to 3% of Canadians have an eating disorder. EOS BOS According to Statistics Canada, in 2016, millions of Canadians met the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. EOS BOS Furthermore, one in ten people with an eating disorder will die, which is the highest mortality rate among mental illnesses. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Health tell the House what the government is doing to support people with eating disorders and their families? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the member for Saint-Laurent, for her excellent work and for giving me an opportunity to highlight our government's commitments to helping people living with eating disorders. EOS BOS Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that come with serious medical complications. EOS BOS This is why our government invested more than $5 million in budget 2017 to provide better mental health support across the country. EOS BOS These investments will make a real difference in the lives of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for years the City of Montreal and the public have been asking Canadian Pacific to install new level crossings to ensure the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. EOS BOS The problem is particularly dire in Laurier—Sainte-Marie and Rosemont. EOS BOS However, despite repeated requests, CP is not co-operating. EOS BOS When will Transport Canada require railway companies such as CP to actually co-operate in good faith with municipalities and consider the safety of pedestrians and cyclists? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, indeed we have been working very hard on this particular issue. EOS BOS It is this government that has brought in grade crossing regulations in order to deal with the situation the hon. EOS BOS member has outlined, which is a case in which the municipality and the rail operator do not agree on where, when, or how a grade crossing separation could be put in place. EOS BOS We encourage the parties to work with these regulations, and of course we at Transport Canada will be there to facilitate if we can. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today the Minister of Transport announced new safety measures for rail transportation. EOS BOS There was nothing about creating a minimum distance between railways and the construction of new buildings. EOS BOS The Federation of Canadian Municipalities recognizes the problem and made recommendations in 2013, but it does not have the authority to establish mandatory standards. EOS BOS What is the government waiting for to take action and to establish a standard for a minimum distance between the construction of new buildings and railway tracks in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Transport Canada has a ministerial advisory council that deals with matters like this. EOS BOS This matter is being considered by that advisory panel at the moment, which is making sure that they cover off all issues with respect to operation and are incorporating it with respect to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. EOS BOS We will continue to have that discussion and move along. EOS BOS In the meantime, we continue to work on rail safety and measures associated with rail safety. EOS BOS Our government has a great track record in that area and will continue in that way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals want to give the Prime Minister four days off a week, prevent members from doing their job in committees, and limit the speaking time of all members. EOS BOS Motion No. 6 EOS BOS was nothing compared to this attempt by the Prime Minister to take total and permanent control of Parliament. EOS BOS The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons claims she wants to discuss this, but at the same time has ordered her MPs to pass these changes in committee in a backroom on Parliament Hill. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister put his house in order? EOS BOS When will he finally show some respect for Parliament? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again allow me to set the record straight for Canadians. EOS BOS The discussion paper talks about a better use of members' time. EOS BOS On Fridays, we are only required to be here for half an hour. EOS BOS It would be realistic to move those hours to other days of the week. EOS BOS Most offices in Canada start their workday at 9 a.m. The House of Commons could as well. EOS BOS The goal behind this option is to enable us to be in our ridings on Fridays so that we can meet with our constituents. EOS
BOS It is the responsibility of all members to exercise self-restraint, and I am asking the member for Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île d'Orléans—Charlevoix to do so. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Mégantic— EOS BOS L'Érable. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to set the record straight. EOS BOS Contrary to what the Liberals think, Parliament belongs to Canadians. EOS BOS They elected all of us to represent them. EOS BOS Contrary to what the Prime Minister thinks, not everyone likes him. EOS BOS Most Canadians do not approve of the deficits he is running. EOS BOS Most Canadians find his insatiable appetite for spending taxpayers' money unacceptable. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister want to silence Canadians who do not think like him? EOS BOS Why does he want to muzzle the opposition members and his own backbenchers? EOS BOS We will not let him do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am taking part in a discussion that includes all members and all Canadians because we want to work with them and we want them to participate in this discussion. EOS BOS Our government knows that the work members do here in the House and in their ridings is important. EOS BOS During the election campaign, we vowed to modernize Parliament and turn it into a 21st-century workplace. EOS BOS Our objective has always been to ensure that Parliament is relevant to Canadians and that the House is accountable, effective, and transparent. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said that he would not interfere in the work of committees, but that is exactly what he is doing. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's staff, over the last number of days, have been at the procedure and House affairs committee, telling the Liberal backbenchers to block the opposition's simple and reasonable request that we have collaboration and consensus on changes to the rules. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister back off and let the Liberal members do their job, as he promised that he would do? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is this government that actually increased funding to committees so that they could do the important work that they need to do. EOS BOS We actually believe in the committee process because it is the committee that can actually study legislation and study ideas way better than we do in this place, and that is exactly what we have asked the committee to do. EOS BOS With respect to the discussion paper, I have asked the committee to broaden the scope of the study they already have in place in regard to the Standing Orders. EOS BOS I believe it is a meaningful conversation that all members need to have. EOS BOS I encourage all members, as well as all Canadians, to participate. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the House leader is in on this charade too, and the Liberal members even know it. EOS BOS They know this is not a discussion paper. EOS BOS They know this is an edict from the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS The House leader just said that she asked the committee; she is asking it to do her dirty work. EOS BOS My question is for the Liberal members of Parliament. EOS BOS I know there are some hard-working people with integrity on that side. EOS BOS Will any of them stand up, show some independence, and say no to the Prime Minister and no to the House leader, who has completely botched this for all of you? EOS
BOS I must remind all members to direct their comments to the Chair. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS government House leader. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that this place needs to be modernized. EOS BOS We need to have this conversation. EOS BOS We need to have this discussion. EOS BOS Every single member of Parliament has a role and responsibility. EOS BOS I recognize that members on both sides of this place have responsibilities, and we want to ensure that we have important conversations. EOS BOS Within this place, members of Parliament have the opportunity to hold the government to account. EOS BOS We believe that within the ridings, constituents have the ability to hold their members of Parliament to account, and that is why I believe that important work is done here in the House as well as in the ridings. EOS
BOS Since when does a cabinet minister or House leader give orders to a committee anyway, Mr. Speaker? EOS BOS The government House leader is ignoring the long-held tradition of getting all-party agreement for an overhaul of the way that democracy works in this place. EOS BOS If the House leader's argument that the government of such a warm and loving Prime Minister could not possibly harm our democracy with the power grab now under way, I wonder if she might speculate with us what the majority government of a prime minister like, say, Kevin O'Leary would do with all that power? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is exactly these hypotheticals and these speculations that the committee has the ability to deal with. EOS BOS That is why we are saying let us have this conversation, let us have this discussion. EOS BOS It is because these are important concerns that Canadians are facing, and we are saying let us have this discussion. EOS BOS That is why I had introduced a discussion paper. EOS BOS I know the committee members sat late once again yesterday. EOS BOS I did visit the members of the committee to thank them for their work. EOS BOS I believe that they are having a meaningful conversation and I think it is important that they continue that conversation. EOS BOS My door will remain open so that we can all work better together. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this goes well beyond an innocent discussion paper. EOS BOS The government House leader should not insult our intelligence by claiming otherwise. EOS BOS However, if she is serious about that, if she is really truly sincere that her motives are pure, will she now stand in her place and tell this House that she accepts that her government has no mandate to change the rules of democracy over the united objections of the opposition? EOS BOS If she will not, then it is pretty clear that her protests of innocence are even more shallow than they sound. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I really do believe that we can have more meaningful conversation and debate in this place. EOS BOS I believe that when it comes to challenging the integrity of individuals, that is for the member to choose to do. EOS BOS I believe that is not needed in the conversation that I would like to have, and that is why I am saying let us have a conversation, let us have a discussion. EOS BOS The member knows very well, as I told him last night, that I actually appreciate a lot of the work that he does. EOS BOS I hope that we can continue working better together, because I believe this place needs to be modernized. EOS BOS It is a commitment we made to Canadians in the electoral campaign. EOS BOS It is something on which Canadians agree that all members in this place need to work better together. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Majeed Uddin Ahmed, a Canadian citizen, together with his wife and their two Canadian children, ages five and one and a half, have been arrested and incarcerated in Saudi Arabia's notorious Dhaban prison for two weeks. EOS BOS One of the children is sick and requires medical care. EOS BOS From the beginning, the minister was made aware of this situation. EOS BOS The family in Canada has been advised that it will have to wait until next week for news as officials have told them, “ EOS BOS It is not in our route of travel”.When will the minister order her officials to change their travel plans and bring these kids home? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are in fact aware of reports of this family being detained in Saudi Arabia. EOS BOS Canadian officials have been working, and will continue to work, with local authorities to receive formal confirmation of the family's present situation. EOS BOS In addition, consular officials are seeking, if there is confirmation of the family's detention, to have consular access with the family. EOS BOS We are in constant daily contact with the family here in Canada and we will continue to work for the well-being of this family. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the culture of corruption is so deep in the Prime Minister's Office that now two of his ex-chiefs of staff are facing RCMP investigations with respect to potential criminal behaviour involving legislators and other government officials. EOS BOS The question must be asked: What does the Prime Minister ask his chiefs of staff to do that ends them in a police investigation and facing possible jail time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague should know very well that Mr. Wright has resigned and has taken sole responsibility for his actions, which is entirely appropriate, given this matter. EOS BOS Again, if today's leader of the Liberal Party wants to speak to others about the importance of acting responsibly in public office and demonstrations of leadership by those who are in positions of authority, perhaps he can explain why the current Liberal leader has, again, taken money from charities that were designed to raise money to provide beds for seniors and literacy programs for kids, that were designed to support mental health. EOS BOS He took hundreds of thousands of dollars from charities that were designed to help those who are the most vulnerable in our society. EOS BOS He should show leadership himself. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Nigel Wright, Mike Duffy, Saulie Zajdel, Bruce Carson, Arthur Porter: the Prime Minister clearly likes to surround himself with men of conviction. EOS BOS In Bruce Carson's case, I think he has five. EOS BOS When did the Prime Minister decide that to work for him, one must either have a criminal record or be willing to obtain one? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Liberal Senator Pana Merchant has $1.7 million hiding outside of this country and is not paying her taxes, who was advocated by the member for Wascana, the Liberal Party— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Canadian Heritage has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is the Liberal leader who says that it is okay for Mac Harb to take $231,000 from taxpayers. EOS BOS As long as he pays it back, he is welcome to come back into the Liberal Party. EOS BOS That is the Liberal standard of ethics. EOS BOS Their senators can rip off the taxpayers, take money away, and as long as they pay the money back, if they get caught, they are welcome to come back into the Liberal Party. EOS BOS That is their approach to ethics: take money from charities, support Liberal senators who do not pay their taxes, and welcome senators back into their caucus who are a disgrace to Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Citizens for Public Justice reports that people living with disabilities are highly vulnerable to poverty, particularly those facing multiple discriminations. EOS BOS Their median income is almost half the median income of those without disabilities. EOS BOS While we appreciate the government's upcoming legislation on accessibility, we know that people living with disabilities face many more issues. EOS BOS I ask the Prime Minister, will the Liberal accessibility legislation address this poverty crisis or will the government at least offer income support through other means? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for her for deep concern for this issue and one that we share. EOS BOS We know that too many Canadians living with disabilities face economic challenges that other Canadians do not have to face. EOS BOS This is going to part of our accessibility legislation to ensure that Canada offers full opportunities for each and every one of us to achieve our potential, regardless of the barriers we may face. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, to everyone's surprise, the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs announced that he was considering setting up tolls on a number of bridges to the Island of Montreal. EOS BOS True to form, he did not consult Quebec's transport minister or any of the mayors of the cities that would be affected by this news. EOS BOS Does the minister understand that consultation is a good idea and that it is always better to share the results of studies than to keep them secret? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously our priority is to build the new bridge over the St. Lawrence, as we said. EOS BOS We will deliver a new bridge in 2018. EOS BOS We said there would be a toll on the bridge. EOS BOS Enough with the speculation and theories. EOS BOS We always said that we would be transparent, and that is what we will do. EOS BOS The tendering process is under way, and three consortiums will submit a proposal to build the new bridge. EOS BOS It did not take our government 13 years to do this. EOS BOS We are getting the new bridge built. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Shooting Sports Association is apparently outraged that Alberta's Chief Firearms Officer would require, of all things, trigger locks for guns on display at gun shows. EOS BOS It is now asking the Conservatives to scrap provincial firearms officers entirely. EOS BOS This is the same group that the Conservatives have sent to represent Canada at the arms trade treaty talks today. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Public Safety tell Canadians, here and now, that he rejects this group's outrageous and extreme demands? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as members know, following the Prime Minister's comments here in the House when he indicated that we would be looking at that body, we in fact put three new individuals onto that body: two police chiefs and one head of a police union. EOS BOS I am very pleased with those appointments. EOS BOS We continue to work together with all segments of the firearms community to ensure that we focus on real crime, as opposed to the long gun registry. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while we welcome new appointments to the committee, this group is still representing Canada internationally today. EOS BOS The minister has another outrage to answer for today as Canadians across the country are shocked that he personally approved filming immigration raids for reality TV. EOS BOS This is not some episode of Cops. EOS BOS These are real people and real officers doing a dangerous job. EOS BOS Filming is exploitative and can put individuals in danger. EOS BOS How could the minister be so reckless? EOS BOS Will he take responsibility and put an immediate end to this dangerous and offensive PR stunt? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the show is about the situation faced daily by our front-line border officers. EOS BOS The privacy of individuals is protected at all times. EOS BOS However, it is important to remember that each year illegal immigrants cost law-abiding Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars and thousands of jobs. EOS BOS We expect the CBSA to enforce Canada's immigration laws by removing individuals who take advantage of Canada's generous immigration system by jumping the queue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is one thing for the minister to be obsessed with people who have gone through traumatic experiences, but it is another thing altogether for him to decide to share that obsession with the entire country. EOS BOS The minister is showing no consideration for these people, who, for reasons we may never know, decided to put their lives in danger and flee their country. EOS BOS He should reflect on that before sensationalizing their situation. EOS BOS Our border services officers do important and dangerous work. EOS BOS Reducing it to simple entertainment is unacceptable. EOS BOS How much is this charade costing our border services? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the show is about the situation faced daily by our front-line border officers. EOS BOS The privacy of individuals is protected at all times. EOS BOS It is important to remember that illegal immigrants cost law-abiding Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars each year and thousands of jobs. EOS BOS We expect the CBSA to enforce Canada's immigration laws by removing individuals who take advantage of Canada's generous immigration system by jumping the queue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, can the Prime Minister tell us whether he has informed cabinet of his plans to engage in Iraq? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you are well aware, the government has already announced assistance for the Iraqi government in its efforts to counter the Islamic State. EOS BOS Obviously, our allies are doing more and more to counter the Islamic State, a terrorist caliphate that poses a major threat not only to the region, but also to us here in Canada. EOS BOS The government is examining its next steps. EOS BOS As I have said many times, the government's practice is clear: if there is to be a combat mission, there will be a debate and a vote here in the House of Commons. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, is the Prime Minister also considering air strikes in Syria? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not going to speculate on decisions that have not yet been taken. EOS BOS The government has been clear that we are strongly supportive of the actions undertaken at the initiative of President Obama and our ally to deal with the threat presented by ISIL, not just in the region but as the broader threat that this terrorist caliphate represents to all of us, including the security of this country. EOS BOS We are carefully considering what options are at our disposal to be helpful. EOS BOS We look for ways to contribute. EOS BOS If there is a combat mission of any kind, including an air combat mission, there will be a debate and a vote in this House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when will the Prime Minister table his Iraq plans in the House for study, a full debate, and a vote? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I just finished saying, the government's practice has been long-standing. EOS BOS If we are planning any kind of a combat mission, including an aerial combat mission, there will of course be a debate and a vote in this House. EOS BOS The government will do that when it actually takes that decision, which it has not done. EOS BOS However, we will make a final decision on that within the next few days. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, before the Prime Minister considers extending the mission, will he report on the activities of Canadian military personnel during the first 30 days and also report on the outcomes of their contribution, if any? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nobody should doubt the contribution of our military personnel in Iraq. EOS BOS They are there at the request of the government of Iraq and especially the minorities that were threatened with genocide. EOS BOS We are very proud to have people who are ready to serve our country and humanity in this way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister first talked about a Canadian combat role in Iraq while in New York. EOS BOS It is time for him to provide Canadians with answers. EOS BOS Precisely what military support has the Prime Minister offered Americans? EOS BOS What is the Canadian objective in our current 30-day mission, and how have we reached that objective? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as members know, the government has already indicated that we have sent some assistance to the Government of Iraq in concert with our allies some weeks ago. EOS BOS As our allies undertake a range of actions, we are contemplating next steps on how we can best be helpful. EOS BOS Let me be very clear. EOS BOS I believe that the mission undertaken by our allies—not just western allies, but a range of allies in the international community—are necessary actions and noble actions. EOS BOS When we think something is necessary and noble, we do not sit back and say only other people should do it. EOS BOS The Canadian way is to do our part. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister should be open and transparent about such an important and dangerous mission. EOS BOS It is high time Canadians got answers to their questions. EOS BOS What was the objective of the first 30 days of the mission? EOS BOS What was accomplished? EOS BOS Did the United States specifically request deployment of CF-18s? EOS BOS How many did they ask for? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we deployed forces to northern Iraq to help minorities withstand genocide. EOS BOS We have halted the advance of the Islamic State, and that is very significant. EOS BOS [English]Let me just repeat that. EOS BOS The people in northern Iraq are facing an act of genocide from the forces of the Islamic State. EOS BOS That is why allies, including Canada, responded. EOS BOS We have gone there to assist the Peshmerga in that fight. EOS BOS They have halted the advance of ISIL in that part of the country. EOS BOS This is very important work, and we should all be thankful for the Canadian Forces and our allies for doing this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has given Canadians very little reason to believe that his government is being open and honest with them about this very serious matter. EOS BOS He has, in fact, given every reason to believe the contrary. EOS BOS Right here in the House of Commons, will the Prime Minister present his case for going to war and his plan for fighting it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's position on these matters since we came to office is unprecedented and has also been clear. EOS BOS Whenever we enter a mission that involves combat, including aerial combat, we present it to the House of Commons for a debate and for a vote. EOS BOS We are proud of that record. EOS BOS We are very proud of the actions undertaken by the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS This has a broad range of support from the international community, including not just Conservatives but Liberals and social democrats the world over, and I think we should put partisanship aside in this chamber as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how long does the Prime Minister expect the war in Iraq to last? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is really the power of the Prime Minister of Canada to determine how long international events will take place or not take place. EOS BOS The establishment, as I have said repeatedly before, of an Islamic caliphate that is beheading children, selling women as slaves, committing acts of genocide against minorities and captured POWs, and planning security attacks on this country is not acceptable, and the government will act. EOS BOS We will act with our allies to make sure those capacities are degraded in a way that they will not continue to be a threat to this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister really believes that Canada is in immediate danger, why is he sending only a handful of aircraft and a few dozen soldiers to provide advice? Why is he not sending more personnel if he truly believes what he is saying in the House today? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the opposition leader is basically saying that the government is taking too long to act, that it is not doing enough. EOS BOS The NDP's position changes from one question to the next. EOS BOS [English]The government is carefully considering its actions, obviously including the ability we have before us and our capacities to contribute. EOS BOS We will carefully consider these things. EOS BOS If they require a vote in Parliament, we will do that, but we will make sure we carefully undertake our actions and take the actions that are in the best interests of the Canadian people and in accord with our international responsibilities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a right to know how long this commitment will last. EOS BOS Let us be even clearer: the original mission was supposed to last 30 days. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is considering expanding Canada's commitment, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs is now talking about a long-term commitment. EOS BOS How long will Canadian soldiers be deployed in Iraq? EOS BOS The Americans were there for more than 10 years. EOS BOS Canada sent 40,000 soldiers to Afghanistan over a period of 11 years. EOS BOS How long will the Prime Minister's war in Iraq last? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct that statement. EOS BOS This action was initiated by President Obama and our allies. EOS BOS [English]This is an action undertaken at the initiative of President Obama involving not just their allies but a broad consensus of the international community. EOS BOS It is a very serious matter. EOS BOS We cannot go out and start throwing around timelines that we are not aware of. EOS BOS We simply have to examine what is in front of us and what we can do. EOS BOS We will come to the House of Commons with a proposal on that matter, and I look forward to a debate and vote on that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how is victory to be defined in Iraq? EOS </s> BOS Once again, Mr. Speaker, let me just lay out how we see the situation. EOS BOS I think it is widely understood. EOS BOS We have at the present time the establishment of a quasi-state, an Islamic caliphate, stretching from Aleppo almost to Baghdad, up until very recently operating entirely in the open, planning attacks, not just genocide against large populations in the region but planning attacks against this country. EOS BOS We will work with our allies on a counterterrorism operation to get us to the point where this organization does not have the capacity to launch those kinds of attacks against us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what is the government's exit strategy in Iraq? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously the government could terminate present deployments at any moment. EOS BOS We obviously have not done that. EOS BOS We are looking at next steps. EOS BOS We will obviously look carefully at steps that we believe would not leave us there in a quagmire for years. EOS BOS That is something all governments are going to avoid. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how long has the Prime Minister been considering air strikes in Iraq? EOS BOS How long? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I just said, the government has made no such decision. EOS BOS However, as we have clearly said since we first came to power, any such decision will be brought before the House for a debate and a vote. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, were air strikes included in the letter that the Prime Minister says he received from the United States last week? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the United States and our other allies have taken a range of actions in Iraq and Syria. EOS BOS It is well known what all of those are. EOS BOS Obviously, they are seeking our assistance wherever we could be helpful, and we are obviously examining what options are most appropriate for this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians first learned about this letter from an interview that the Prime Minister did with The Wall Street Journal last week. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister going to make that letter public, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government will make public its own decisions. EOS BOS Ultimately, while we act with our American and other allies, this country is responsible for its own decisions, its own actions, and those are the things we will put to this Parliament to debate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what are the rules of engagement for the Canadian soldiers currently in Iraq? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the rules are very clear. EOS BOS They are there to advise and assist Iraqi forces in the northern part of the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, almost a year ago, I stood with the government and celebrated the introduction of Bill C-16, which would extend the same rights and protections enjoyed by other Canadians to those in the trans community. EOS BOS Now this government bill stands stalled in the Senate. EOS BOS It has been over six years since this legislation was first passed in this House, but still transgender Canadians are told to wait even longer, to go on waiting for their rights. EOS BOS What are the Liberals doing to get Bill C-16 passed into law? EOS BOS Has the minister communicated the urgency of this bill to senators, or will they let trans rights die in the Senate for a third time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank the hon. EOS BOS member across the way for his tireless efforts in terms of getting us to this place where I was proud, based on his work and the work of many before him, to introduce Bill C-16. EOS BOS I am following this piece of legislation. EOS BOS I think it is incumbent upon all parliamentarians to do what they can to ensure its expedited passage so we can ensure that individuals, all Canadians in this country, are free to be themselves. EOS BOS It is imperative that we move this bill forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the regional minister from Prince Edward Island will be aware of the huge gathering last night in Surrey where the Conservative government was accused of bleeding out coastal and rural communities with its harsh new EI regulations against seasonal workers. EOS BOS Tomorrow night, a meeting takes place in the regional minister's own riding. EOS BOS Would she commit to take the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development to that meeting so that the minister can face reality and see the absolute devastation EI changes are having on individuals, on business and on the economy? EOS BOS Will we see both ministers there? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the changes that were brought into EI are mere clarifications of the rules and responsibilities that people who collect EI have had since EI was brought in many decades ago. EOS BOS What it means is that when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own, they are allowed to collect income support while they are looking for another job. EOS BOS We are clarifying what the definition of “looking for a job” is, but we are also providing a lot more support in helping them identify jobs that are available in their areas, in their skill sets, so that they can be better off working than not. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are many residents in my riding of Davenport who have been waiting upwards of three years to be reunited with their spouses and children. EOS BOS This has led to significant economic impacts, to broken families, and to an enormous amount of stress. EOS BOS We know that the large backlogs and unacceptable processing times are the result of the former Conservative government's cutting of immigration levels and resources. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship please update the House on what he is doing to accelerate bringing families together here in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that yesterday, we reduced the processing times for spouses and their families from two years to one year. EOS BOS A special thanks to the young officials whose tiger team led to a radical improvement in the processing guidelines for our new system, and I can tell the House that we will harness their skills to improve our performance in other areas. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said that the rules of engagement are to advise and assist the Iraqis, but the question is, assist them how? EOS BOS For instance, are Canadian soldiers currently going on patrols with Iraqis or Kurds? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I said “ advise and assist the Iraqis”. EOS BOS [English]If I could just use the terminology in English, it is quite precise. EOS BOS It is to advise and to assist. EOS BOS It is not to accompany. EOS BOS I think that was laid out before the parliamentary committee. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, are they going into combat zones? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I just said that Canadian soldiers are not accompanying the Iraqi forces into combat. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, have Canadian Forces assisted in targeting ISIS troops? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, as I have said, the purpose of Canadian Forces in Iraq is to assist and to advise the Iraqi forces as they have been resisting, particularly in the north, a force bent on the genocide of the people who live there. EOS BOS These are the actions they are undertaking. EOS BOS While there is some risk, there is not a direct combat role. EOS BOS I say once again, we are very proud of people who do this work on our behalf and keep all of us, not just in that part of the world but all of us here in Canada, safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, is targeting or coordinating attacks by others a combat role, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you can understand, I neither have the will nor the desire to get into detailed discussions of military operations here. EOS BOS As I have said repeatedly, the Canadian Forces involved in Iraq are not involved in combat. EOS BOS They are there to assist Iraqi and Peshmerga forces in undertaking combat against a brutal enemy that is intent on their slaughter. EOS BOS We will go there and we will assist them and make sure we stop that kind of problem there and not at our own shores. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, although the Minister of Canadian Heritage is free to make major changes to the rules governing our distinct culture, she has the responsibility to be open and transparent about what she is calling her “ EOS BOS public consultations”. EOS BOS In the interest of transparency, when will the minister make public the briefs submitted as part of these consultations? EOS BOS One thing is certain; they contain important information. EOS BOS Can our ecosystem count on the minister to do what everyone thinks is the right thing and ask foreign companies such as Google, Facebook, and Netflix to pay their fair share? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his important question. EOS BOS I would like to remind him that we are indeed holding an open and transparent consultation process and that we are going to make public the briefs submitted by the various stakeholders. EOS BOS I thank the member. EOS BOS I know that he specifically asked me to make this information public. EOS BOS Of course, I agree with him. EOS BOS This is a good example of co-operation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Alison Azer's four children were kidnapped and are now thought to be in Mahabad, Iran. EOS BOS She has been in touch with the RCMP but is extremely frustrated with the lack of response from the government. EOS BOS She is worried that her daughters may be subjected to female genital mutilation and that her older son may be sent to a madrassa. EOS BOS We understand, based upon communications between our offices, that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is open to a meeting. EOS BOS Would the minister confirm today that he will meet with Mrs. Azer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the safety and well-being of the Azer family continues to be a priority of this government. EOS BOS As I have done before, the Minister of Foreign Affairs would be happy to meet with Ms. Azer to continue collaboration in the pursuit of the safe return of her children to Canada. EOS BOS Canadian consular officials and law enforcement agencies continue to work domestically and internationally with the relevant agencies to make sure that we return the kids home safely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, back to the question of genocide, the Parliament of the U.K., the U.S. Congress, and Secretary of State Kerry have all condemned the ISIS killings of Yazidis, Muslims, and Christian minorities as genocide. EOS BOS Your government had the chance to do the same thing in this House yesterday. EOS BOS You refused. EOS BOS You hid— EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member knows that we do not use the word “you” unless referring to the Speaker. EOS BOS I do not think he means to refer to the Speaker. EOS BOS I hope not. EOS BOS Perhaps the member could rephrase his question and complete it. EOS BOS I ask the member to get to the question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the current government had a chance to do the same thing in this House yesterday. EOS BOS It refused and hid behind weasel words. EOS BOS My question for the government is this. EOS BOS Why did the government shamefully put Canada outside the consensus view of our allies and turn a blind eye to reality? EOS BOS Why do the Liberals not come to their senses and realize exactly what is going on over there, which is, in fact, genocide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is what the U.K. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs said on April 20:...genocide is a matter of legal rather than political opinion. EOS BOS We as the Government are not the prosecutor, the judge or the jury.... EOS BOS It is essential that these decisions are based on credible judicial process.... EOS BOS Right now, our priority is to prevent atrocities from taking place, and that is why we are playing a leading role in the global coalition against Daesh. EOS BOS Replace “ EOS BOS U.K.” with “Canada”, and it is exactly what I have to say. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if all of the atrocities, war crimes, and crimes against humanity perpetrated by ISIS are not genocide, then what are they? EOS BOS We know that the UN Security Council is clearly incapable of instructing the International Criminal Court to act, but Canada should not hide behind international legal dysfunction. EOS BOS When will the Liberals fulfill their moral obligation to call this what it is, genocide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I just want to inform my colleague that indeed the Government of Canada is asking for this international investigation on the atrocities and the horrors committed by Daesh and to be sure that it will be prosecuted and also to investigate whether it is a genocide. EOS BOS We are pushing for that. EOS BOS We are asking for that because it has all the hallmarks of a genocide. EOS BOS It is why this recognition should be done properly internationally. EOS BOS There is nothing more important than to recognize a genocide by the proper process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, getting more women elected and having a more representative Parliament is a goal we all share. EOS BOS While this Parliament set a new record, women still have only 26% of the seats in the House. EOS BOS At this rate, it will take over 60 years to achieve equality. EOS BOS I have tabled the candidate gender equity act to take a concrete step forward. EOS BOS Will the government support getting my bill to committee and work with us, so together we can take another step for gender equality? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's efforts. EOS BOS We take note of his private member's bill and will study it on its merits when it is debated in the House. EOS BOS Our government supports the idea of more women and people of various genders participating in the political debate in the country. EOS BOS This is clearly a commitment that our government and our Prime Minister have shown. EOS BOS We look forward to continuing the leadership on this front. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the email trail about contracting out of marine medical emergency calls shows clear evidence of Conservative incompetence. EOS BOS The process is badly mismanaged. EOS BOS One military official said, “ EOS BOS As we have seen in other high profile search and rescue issues, rational thinking does not apply”.Is the Minister of National Defence now willing to admit his Italian experiment was reckless, or will he at least have the decency to stand and explain why his department pushed this irrational move to have medical emergency calls answered in Rome? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the top priority of the Canadian Coast Guard is the safety of our mariners. EOS BOS There was an interruption in services, which has since been rectified. EOS BOS We have a contract with a Canadian company that is taking all the medical calls. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, closing the Quebec City search and rescue centre is another example of this government's improvisation. EOS BOS Francophone mariners still have no guarantee that services will be available in their language. EOS BOS The fiasco of medical emergency calls being answered in Italy came about because of the ill-advised closure of the St. John's centre. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives learn from their mistakes and forego plans to close the Quebec City centre, or will they continue to endanger the lives of our mariners? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, the safety of mariners is our top priority. EOS BOS We are confident that the changes we are making in Quebec City will have no negative impact on the ability to respond to distress incidents on the water, quickly, effectively and in both official languages. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, rerouting marine medical emergency calls to Italy is simply outrageous. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives not get this? EOS BOS How was this not obvious?When this was first raised, Conservatives claimed this was an interim measure. EOS BOS We now know that was wrong. EOS BOS National Defence wanted the policy changed permanently. EOS BOS It took an emergency at sea to change its ridiculous plan. EOS BOS Will the Minister of National Defence stand and take responsibility for this failed policy, or will he continue to allow his department to make senseless decisions that put the lives at mariners at risk? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the safety of mariners is our top priority and I can assure the hon. EOS BOS member that the policy is that a Canadian company will take all medical calls. EOS
BOS Actually, Mr. Speaker, those students were wondering when the government was going to do something about reducing their debts. EOS BOS Canada's largest reporting agency has just given us the figures. EOS BOS There has been a 9% increase in the debt of Canadians in the last 12 months. EOS BOS We are up to $1.4 trillion. EOS BOS That is why the OECD reminds us that Canadian families are the most indebted in the world. EOS BOS When is the government going to do anything about ATM fees and sky-high credit card interest rates? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, every year the NDP comes with certain demands. EOS BOS It is usually a day or two before the budget is brought down. EOS BOS Each time the NDP's demands are that we pick the pockets of Canadians. EOS BOS This government is more concerned about putting money back into the pockets of Canadians. EOS BOS We have long spoken of consumer and household debt. EOS BOS We understand that interest rates inevitably will go up. EOS BOS We would remind Canadians to make certain that they keep their households in the black, as our government is going to keep this book in the black. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the Minister of Finance was buying new shoes, I was wearing Phentex slippers in the Saint-Colomban home of Véronique Chiasson. EOS BOS Her mother lent me the slippers. EOS BOS Véronique is going through the same thing many other young Canadian families are going through. EOS BOS She and her husband work hard; they slave away. EOS BOS They want help from the government for themselves and their three children. EOS BOS When will the government lower ATM fees and put an end to usurious credit card interest rates in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has provided record support for low-income Canadians. EOS BOS For example, we have lowered the taxes 160 times in Canada. EOS BOS The average family of four now has $3,400 more in its pockets each year. EOS BOS In fact, we have removed one million low-income Canadians from the tax rolls altogether. EOS BOS Every time we have made any movement, this government—I mean, this opposition party—has voted against this government's initiatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Burlington has more seniors per capita than any other community in the GTA. EOS BOS Burlingtonians and all Canadians deserve to have a strong and secure retirement so that they can enjoy their next chapter after their working lives. EOS BOS Could the minister for employment please inform the House on the actions our government has taken to help Canadians with their retirement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last week the Liberal leader said, “ EOS BOS We’re looking at an expansion and a mandatory expansion of the CPP of the type that Kathleen Wynne put forward in Ontario.” EOS BOS The Kathleen Wynne plan is the federal Liberal plan. EOS BOS The numbers that the Ontario government has published suggest that a worker earning just $60,000 a year would face a $1,000 pay cut, but his employer, a small business, would also have to match that $1,000 tax increase, which according to the CFIB would lead to layoffs and further wage cuts. EOS BOS This would send reverberations throughout the entire economy. EOS BOS That is why we will never support it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been six months since the Minister of Justice was appointed, and in that time, the minister has found plenty of time to attend pay-to-play fundraisers, but has not found the time to appoint a single judge. EOS BOS This at a time when our courts face an unprecedented backlog. EOS BOS All the minister can say is that she will get around to it. EOS BOS When will the minister stop fundraising and start appointing desperately needed judges? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I recognize the importance of making appointments to the judiciary across the country and doing that based on merit, based on diversity. EOS BOS We are entering into a comprehensive process to do that. EOS BOS Having said that, I do recognize that there are a number of positions that need to be filled in the very immediate future, and we are undertaking a quick process in order to be able to do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has to understand the urgency in appointing judges, and yet the minister has not even figured out the process, let alone appointed a single judge. EOS BOS The minister is creating a crisis because of her own apathy. EOS BOS How backlogged do the Liberals want the courts to be? EOS BOS When will the minister stop going AWOL and start doing her job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to ensuring that we make substantive and thoughtful appointments to the judiciary EOS BOS . I will ensure and am committed to engaging with stakeholders, including the judiciary, on these appointments. EOS BOS We are committed to a review of the judicial appointment process based on the principles of openness, transparency, merit, and diversity EOS BOS . I will ensure that we move forward with these appointments within a time frame that recognizes the needs of the courts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, minimum sentences for convicted drug traffickers who target kids under the age of 18 was recently overturned by the B.C. Court of Appeal. EOS BOS Our youth need to be protected from drug traffickers who directly target them. EOS BOS Are the Liberals prepared to challenge this ruling? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been tasked by the Prime Minister to undertake a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, including sentencing reform. EOS BOS We are moving forward with this review, engaging with stakeholders, engaging with experts in this area, to ensure that we provide the overall review, which has not been done for many, many years. EOS BOS We will be reviewing the mandatory minimum penalties and sentences, certainly recognizing that there is a need to punish the more severe serious crimes, while ensuring that we maintain sentences that are appropriate and in line with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Employment and Social Development has a problem with numbers, and not just the ones he gets off Kijiji. EOS BOS He is unable to get the facts straight when looking at a list of companies that employ temporary foreign workers. EOS BOS For example, according to the government, Sharico Holdings has 750 temporary foreign workers, when, in reality— EOS BOS surprise, surprise—it has only one. EOS BOS How can the minister convince us that he has fixed the temporary foreign worker program when he used bad data to make his decisions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the data in question were provided by the employers. EOS BOS Our fundamental reforms have led to a significant reduction in applications for temporary foreign workers. EOS BOS In fact, employers' labour market opinion applications have dropped by 75%. EOS BOS We are ensuring that Canadians come first in the labour market and that this program is used as a last resort. EOS BOS That is what we have done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we need an independent review. EOS BOS Clearly the government cannot get the job done. EOS BOS The minister keeps blaming the companies for providing false information, but it was his department that was supposed to be doing the verifying. EOS BOS Now he says that all information will be checked for accuracy, but only one in four employers will be inspected for compliance, and not all inspections will include a site visit. EOS BOS How does the minister call it due diligence, when inspections are limited to shuffling paperwork? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as part of our reforms designed to ensure that Canadians come first, to combat abuse of the program, and to ensure that it  does not distort Canada's labour market, we are quadrupling the number of investigators. EOS BOS We have expanded their powers. EOS BOS They can do searches at workplaces using this program. EOS BOS We are about to adopt regulations to make more stringent the administrative monetary penalties. EOS BOS We are taking real action to ensure that Canadians come first in our labour market. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government's continued attacks on asylum seekers are disturbing. EOS BOS Yesterday we learned that the government consulted only one province, Ontario, and Ontario does not even want that power. EOS BOS In fact, not one province has asked the government to make these changes. EOS BOS Will the government stop inventing solutions to problems that do not exist, and will it eliminate this unfair provision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the rules that apply to refugees and asylum seekers are not going to change because of any measures in this bill. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals insist on talking about this measure and not all the other budget measures we have taken to make Canada's middle class the strongest in the world, as indicated in The New York Times study? EOS BOS This is thanks to successive Conservative budgets and our economic policy, which is why we are so proud of this budget and the measures in this bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, although the Prime Minister promised a different kind of government, he has no problem with his Minister of Justice participating in a Liberal Party fundraiser at $500 a plate. EOS BOS However, the ministers' guide, “Open and Accountable Government”, is very clear: there should be no preferential access to government, or appearance of preferential access, in exchange for political contributions. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us why he is not able to follow the rules that he, himself, set? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, fundraising is an activity that every member of this House engages in. EOS BOS Thankfully, on a federal level there are strict rules in place that determine how fundraising activities occur. EOS BOS We do not take donations from corporations and we do not take donations from unions. EOS BOS In advance, I proactively sought the opinion of the Ethics Commissioner, to whom there was no conflict. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with that answer it seems that sunny ways are clouding over more and more. EOS BOS It seems like only yesterday that the government released ethical guidelines that state: There should be no preferential access to government...accorded to individuals or organizations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties. EOS BOS Even Conservative Bev Oda, in an ethically challenged government, was caught in the same type of scandal and gave back the contributions. EOS BOS Why will the Minister of Justice not do the same thing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my friend opposite is obviously struggling with a very basic concept. EOS BOS The Liberal Party raises money in accordance with all the rules under the Canada Elections Act. EOS BOS In this case my colleague, Minister of Justice, proactively reached out to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to discuss this particular event, and she indicated that it was appropriate. EOS BOS That is the ethical standard that this government has raised from the previous government that was before us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Master Warrant Officer Dodsworth was denied compensation under the home equity assistance program. EOS BOS His family lost $72,000. EOS BOS Neil Dodsworth spent 33 years serving our country, including in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Haiti. EOS BOS The home equity assistance program is meant to protect Canadian Forces members from financial losses when required to relocate. EOS BOS CAF members should not have to hire lawyers to fight for compensation. EOS BOS Why are our soldiers denied this funding, and why has the government not fixed this problem? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since this matter is before the court, it would be inappropriate to comment on this case. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time this has happened. EOS BOS The government knows about this problem and has not fixed it. EOS BOS It is a pattern under the government. EOS BOS Canadian Forces members serve our country proudly and should not have to come home to fight bureaucracy, whether it is Canadian Forces members fighting for home equity assistance,fighting for disability benefits, or accessing mental health services, or veterans and their families fighting for benefits. EOS BOS Canadian soldiers are not getting what they deserve. EOS BOS When will the government treat Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans with the respect they deserve? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, they get respect and admiration every day from this government. EOS BOS No government has done a better job of sticking up for all these issues and reaching out to assist these individuals and investing in them than this government. EOS BOS I am very proud of our record in that area. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after Volkswagen was caught illegally falsifying emission tests and lying about the performance of its vehicles, U.S. regulators, senators, and Congress wasted no time taking it to task. EOS BOS Reports today say the case in the U.S. will be settled with fines, recalls, buybacks, and cash for consumers. EOS BOS However, Canada has no deal, as per usual. EOS BOS Even though tens of thousands of these vehicles are in our driveways, and on our highways and roads, why are Canadian consumers, once again, condemned as second-class citizens and the doormats of recall? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I share the member's concern for the safety of our roads. EOS BOS In fact, this past week, we told Fiat Chrysler that we considered four of its models were dangerous and had defects in them. EOS BOS We have gone forward. EOS BOS This is one example. EOS BOS We have many other examples. EOS BOS We believe it is important for Canadians to know when there are defects in different models of cars. EOS BOS We will continue to do that. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development told Canadians that the real reason Service Canada cannot keep up with EI requests is that there are too many unemployed people applying for benefits. EOS BOS Now, it seems to me there is a solution here. EOS BOS Instead of letting the jobless rate rise, lower it with a job creation plan. EOS BOS Instead of cutting back on EI services, give Canadians the support they need. EOS BOS Is the government just going to give us more excuses, or will it finally decide to act? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, we have done exactly that already. EOS BOS When we noticed there was an increase in demand during December and January, the spike season, and when the increase in demand was greater than what we had anticipated, we immediately put extra resources to help process EI claims. EOS BOS We are seeing positive results from that. EOS BOS We are seeing the backlog come down. EOS BOS We are seeing Canadians get the benefits they need and deserve in a more timely manner. EOS BOS Our goal is to get those benefits to them when they need and deserve them. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, when will the government stop blaming unemployed people? They played by all the rules. EOS BOS The lack of empathy for thousands of unemployed Canadian families is stunning. EOS BOS This is not just about statistics, although the numbers will back me up here. EOS BOS This is about out-of-work Canadians being told it does not matter if they have to wait six or seven weeks just to get their EI cheques. EOS BOS These are tough economic times. EOS BOS Why is the government making Canadian families wait? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, we are trying to get those cheques to them just as quickly as possible. EOS BOS We understand how difficult it is when people lose their jobs due to circumstances beyond their control. EOS BOS We are trying to get the EI system to go faster. EOS BOS We are putting more people on the job to deal with the current problem. EOS BOS Over the long term, we are automating the system. EOS BOS We encourage employers to automate their filings, because it will go faster. EOS BOS The real scheme is to create jobs. EOS BOS That is what we are doing. EOS BOS We have more jobs created in the last month. EOS BOS In fact, thanks in part to our action plan, there are over 610,000 more net new jobs in this country than there were at the pit of the recession. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, let us just take a look at the government's track record right now. EOS BOS The jobless rate just climbed another notch today, after months of bad news. EOS BOS The government's corporate tax giveaways cannot guarantee one single job. EOS BOS Across this country, Conservative-approved foreign takeovers are shipping Canadian jobs overseas or south. EOS BOS Canadians are finding out they cannot even rely on EI, a service they spent their whole working lives paying into. EOS BOS When is the government going to reverse its losing streak? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I am proud to be part of a government that is considered by many Canadians and by many other countries as a winner EOS BOS . We will continue to be in that position for years to come because of decisions by the NDP to oppose every measure that we take to move forward on job creation and on protecting Canadians who are at risk. EOS BOS In fact, I would ask the member, why did the NDP members vote over 100 times against measures that would protect Canadians, for example, against the TFSA, against the increase in GIS, and more and more and more? EOS BOS Let us have the NDP answer that. EOS
BOS And crickets on his parliamentary secretary. EOS BOS Mr EOS BOS . Speaker, today the Liberals moved to cut off debate on their omnibus budget bill, something they once deplored when the Conservatives did it and something they promised never to do. EOS BOS Buried within the bill, among changes to 35 other laws, is the cancelling of small business tax cuts, tax cuts that the Liberals promised they would keep. EOS BOS The PBO reported today that this broken promise would not only cost small businesses $2.2 billion, but it would kill jobs and hurt economic growth. EOS BOS Now that the Prime Minister knows the true cost of his flip-flop, will he do what he promised and reduce the small business tax rate? EOS </s> BOS Actually, Mr. Speaker, the budget implementation bill contains commitments that we made in our platform. EOS BOS There are very clear commitments in the budget. EOS BOS These are things that we are putting forward that would indeed allow for nine out of 10 Canadians to get more generous child benefit cheques as of July 1. EOS BOS On top of that, we have allowed for around 20 hours of debate on the second reading of this bill. EOS BOS These are things that are greater proportionately than what any previous government has done for the small size of this budget bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in last year's budget, the Conservatives imposed tariffs that raised the cost of everything, from wigs for cancer patients to baby carriages. EOS BOS They also introduced a bogus job training program that went nowhere, because the provinces were being treated unfairly. EOS BOS Will the government fix those two mistakes in tomorrow's budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, it is a bit rich for the Liberal Party of Canada to criticize our government's record on job creation. EOS BOS Again, like the other opposition party, Liberals have voted against every job creation measure that this government has brought forward. EOS BOS We froze the EI rates to provide certainty and flexibility to workers and employers. EOS BOS We cut taxes for manufacturers so they could purchase new equipment and invest back in their own businesses. EOS BOS We have provided $70 billion in job creation infrastructure. EOS BOS The budget is tomorrow. EOS BOS I would encourage that member to have patience until tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a disturbing pattern of the government abandoning Canadians in difficulty abroad. EOS BOS Henk Tepper, a New Brunswick potato farmer, has been in a Lebanese prison for almost three months following a commercial dispute. EOS BOS Mr. Tepper's wife and young children say that they have heard nothing but dead air from this government. EOS BOS They have received no information. EOS BOS It is unacceptable for the government to abandon Canadians in circumstances as difficult as Mr. Tepper's. EOS BOS When will the government intervene with Lebanese authorities, have Mr. Tepper released from the prison in Lebanon and brought back to Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his courtesy in letting me know he would be raising this issue. EOS BOS I also thank him for the opportunity to set the record straight. EOS BOS In fact, Mr. Tepper and his family have been given substantial, vigorous and active assistance since the time he was arrested. EOS BOS There have been regular visits and there has been regular contact with Mr. Tepper, his family and his lawyers to give all possible assistance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in a remote aboriginal community, when it is the middle of the night and it is 30 degrees below zero, and a woman has been violently assaulted, it is absolutely necessary that she receive the same protection as all other Canadians. EOS BOS That is exactly why our government introduced Bill S-2, which will allow enforcement emergency protection orders, but yesterday, the Liberal leader shamefully whipped his caucus to vote against it. EOS BOS Can the Minister for Status of Women please update this House on the difference between our government's position and the Liberals'? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the truth is that women in the Liberal Party and the NDP would never give up these rights themselves that in the same breath they are denying to aboriginal women. EOS BOS My question is this: Why are they entitled to these rights and aboriginal women are not?On this side of the House, we stand with aboriginal women, and we will make sure that they receive the same rights and same protections as all other Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, around the world we are seeing that institutional bilingualism results in the assimilation of minority languages. EOS BOS This is what censuses in Canada have been showing for 40 years. EOS BOS What is the federal government doing? EOS BOS It is on a promotional tour in support of institutional bilingualism. EOS BOS They are strengthening English in Quebec while sprinkling a few services in French here and there in the rest of Canada. EOS BOS Does the minister realize that, as is, the federal policy on institutional bilingualism is the grave of the French language in North America? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for giving me this opportunity to talk about the government’s dedication to official bilingualism and linguistic duality. EOS BOS The social contract we have in our country is based on the founding peoples, anglophones and francophones. EOS BOS We have built a pluralistic country on this foundation, and we are in the midst of reconciliation with indigenous peoples. EOS BOS We will promote English in Quebec, and we will promote French outside Quebec. EOS BOS That is who we are as Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to the fair and equitable tax treatment of all Canadians. EOS BOS Our Minister of National Revenue has been working hard to ensure that Canadians are treated in a fair and respectful manner by CRA. EOS BOS It was this government that introduced the taxpayer bill of rights as well as the Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsman to provide Canadians with a clear statement of their service rights and a venue to voice concerns. EOS BOS I understand that the minister has recently become aware of some troubling videos that do not meet our high expectations of CRA staff. EOS BOS I would ask her to inform this House of the steps she has taken to address this. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was recently made aware of some very troubling videos that have been made using CRA resources. EOS BOS I find these videos totally disrespectful to Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS This is certainly not how CRA officials are trained. EOS BOS I have asked CRA senior management to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary measures immediately. EOS BOS I have also asked the Taxpayers' Ombudsman to review all CRA training videos and to ensure that they respect taxpayers' rights. EOS BOS We demand professionalism from CRA employees and this type of behaviour is completely unacceptable. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, this morning, Algonquin elders, supported by community members, are gathering on this Hill to remind parliamentarians of a sacred place near here. EOS BOS The Algonquins have asked politicians at all levels to respect our rights regarding important matters that affect our community, and yet the Zibi development project continues ahead. EOS BOS The government has committed to a new nation-to-nation relationship, so I would ask again, when will the government honour its promises and commitments to indigenous peoples, and move forward by supporting Bill C-262 to adopt and implement the UN declaration? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, we do recognize and support the public's right to engage in peaceful protests. EOS BOS It is our hope that the parties involved, including the Windmill Development Group, local municipalities, the Algonquins of Quebec, and the Algonquins of Ontario can work together to find a constructive, respectful, and positive way forward. EOS BOS As always, we thank the member opposite for his ongoing work, not only in the riding, but on the development of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by making sure that it is implemented properly.

BOS Mr. Speaker, the coroner who investigated the tragic death of cyclist Mathilde Blais was clear. EOS BOS If the truck that hit her had been equipped with side guards, the young cyclist would not have fallen under the truck's wheels. EOS BOS My Bill C-603 would make side guards mandatory on heavy trucks. EOS BOS We can save lives. EOS BOS What will the government do to protect pedestrians and cyclists? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of Canadians is an absolute priority for us. EOS BOS Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who has been affected by this type of tragic accident involving bicyclists and pedestrians. EOS BOS We are always looking for ways to improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists who find themselves in proximity to vehicles. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have a simple way. EOS BOS The coroner's report on the tragic death of cyclist Mathilde Blais is clear. EOS BOS If the truck had side guards, she would still be with us. EOS BOS The NDP has been calling for mandatory side guards for more than eight years. EOS BOS We could have had fewer deaths, less heartbreak, fewer ghost bikes. EOS BOS We need to take action. EOS BOS The NDP has reintroduced Olivia Chow's bill to make truck side guards mandatory. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives support our initiative and ensure the safety of cyclists? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said a few moments ago in French, the health and safety of Canadians is our top priority. EOS BOS Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those who have been involved in these types of tragic bicycle and pedestrian incidents. EOS BOS We are always looking at ways to improve pedestrian and cycling safety in the presence of motor vehicles. EOS BOS The member will also know that any province or territory is free to require side guards on trucks operating within their boundaries. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this spring we saw the Conservatives abandon the very principles they claim they came to Ottawa to defend: ramming through their Trojan Horse budget bill, gutting their own Federal Accountability Act, treating their backbench MPs like a rubber stamp, using closure a record number of times, engaging in electoral fraud and slush funds and, of course, having ministers travelling the world staying in luxury hotels and taking $23,000 limo rides on the taxpayers' dime. EOS BOS How can a former member of the Reform Party defend this behaviour? EOS BOS This summer, will the Prime Minister just shuffle the deck chairs on the Titanic or will he get his Conservative cabinet under control? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we just had one of the most legislatively productive periods, and the NDP members, by deciding they will oppose everything and filibuster everything, have proven themselves to be the least influential opposition in terms of legislative agenda in the history of this Parliament. EOS BOS Canadians elected us to focus on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. EOS BOS That is what we are doing. EOS BOS That is why the Canadian economy continues to have superior performance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this spring has not been easy for the Conservatives. EOS BOS The cabinet cannot agree among themselves, nor can Conservative backbenchers. EOS BOS It is total chaos over there. EOS BOS There is growing dissent among the Conservatives, because they are attacking employment insurance, old age security, environmental assessment and fleet separation. EOS BOS To bring back some order, they need to stop introducing sloppy legislation. EOS BOS Will they finally learn their lesson from the fiascos of this session of Parliament? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, Canadians and Quebeckers know that passing our budget on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity will produce positive results here in Canada. EOS BOS We are opening new markets through free trade agreements. EOS BOS We have also brought in measures to protect the integrity of our immigration system. EOS BOS So instead of engaging in useless political rhetoric—like the NDP members who want to increase taxes—and dragging out the legislative process, which prevents us from getting anything done, we have delivered, with an excellent track record that is very positive for the Canadian economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we can see by their answers that they have not learned their lesson. EOS BOS Some ministers have used military helicopters as personal taxis; others have refused to apologize for insulting Alberta's deputy premier; others are rewriting the conflict of interest record book; and their parliamentary leader has issued repeated gag orders out of fear of debating with the NDP. EOS BOS Will they use this parliamentary break to pull their heads out of the quicksand they keep sinking into? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, it will be good to see our constituents and talk to them about the savings we have found in the way we operate the federal government. EOS BOS We have made targeted investments that show promise for research and innovation in order to make our economy more productive and innovative. EOS BOS We have also introduced measures to open up markets and help boost exports, instead of coming up with a grim program that would lead to job cuts and business closures as a result of higher taxes and a carbon tax. EOS BOS That is absolutely not our approach and we will continue to do what is good for the economy. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya constitutes the world's largest refugee camp. EOS BOS The Government of Kenya recently announced that it will close this camp, thereby breaching its international obligations to protect asylum seekers and refugees. EOS BOS This is not only inhumane, but it also puts people in danger who will often make positive contributions to economic growth. EOS BOS The United Nations has stated clearly that the closure of this camp will be devastating and have asked that the decision be reconsidered. EOS BOS What is Canada's position on Kenya's decision to close the Dadaab refugee camp? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, our government is very concerned about the Government of Kenya's decision to disband its department of refugee affairs and its intention to close the refugee camp at Dadaab. EOS BOS International refugee law and refugees' rights must be protected. EOS BOS All returns must be voluntary and conducted in accordance with domestic and international laws. EOS BOS Refugees need to be protected. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the depths to which the Conservatives will sink to attack our seniors is shocking. EOS BOS Conservatives started by taxing income trusts and then delaying old age security, but now they want to go even further. EOS BOS Finance officials confirm that the budget bill would hit not-for-profit health centres' facilities with a bill for HST. EOS BOS That is right. EOS BOS After taxing investments and delaying pensions, the budget is again targeting seniors for collection. EOS BOS We know that winter is coming, and Conservatives clearly have their hands in our seniors' pockets. EOS BOS Did they really think that nobody was going to notice this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has, over the years, reduced taxes for Canadians to the point where they are lower than they have been in the last 50 years. EOS BOS We will continue in this next budget, because we are expecting a surplus, to reduce taxes further for hard-working Canadian families, including seniors. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's network of protected areas help to mitigate the impacts of climate change. They protect and restore healthy, resilient ecosystems and assist in the recovery of species at risk. EOS BOS Canada is committed to conserve at least 17% of our country's land and fresh water by 2020, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, indigenous peoples, and other key partners. EOS BOS Can the government please update this House on the recent progress towards this target? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians love our national parks and national heritage places, and we saw that clearly this year with record attendance at our parks and historic places with free entry for Canada 150. EOS BOS On Friday, October 27, I was extremely pleased to be joined by the member for Kelowna—Lake Country as Canada, British Columbia, and representatives of the southern communities of the Syilx Okanagan Nation announced a renewed commitment to move forward together to establish a new national park reserve in the south Okanagan. EOS BOS After many years, we are pleased to be moving forward to protect this iconic place, and I want to thank the member for his help. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the scandals involving the President of the Treasury Board keep piling up, while services for Canadians are being cut. EOS BOS People do not understand why there are some rules for his friends and other rules for ordinary people. EOS BOS There is going to be less help available at Service Canada centres, and some are going to close altogether. EOS BOS I am talking about services that directly affect the public and not just his friends. EOS BOS In the meantime, the minister responsible for the cuts is refusing to answer questions in the House and refusing to talk to journalists. EOS BOS Am I going to have to send my questions to him on Twitter to get him to respond? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there will be no Service Canada offices closing and no impact on in-person services offered. EOS BOS Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to complete Canada's economic recovery, create jobs, and return to balanced budgets. EOS BOS Improving the way we deliver EI services to Canadians by modernizing the way we accomplish this is one of our goals. EOS BOS Our government is committed to effective and efficient use of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. EOS BOS I hope that I have not chosen the wrong moment, but on Thursday in the debate around ISIS, I discovered in reviewing the Hansard that I made an error of fact, and I wish to withdraw it. EOS BOS U.S. Republicans were never featured in a photograph with ISIS fighters. EOS BOS I regret the error. EOS </s> BOS I am sure the House appreciates the clarification from the hon. member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, tens of thousands of Canadians are dropping out of the labour force. EOS BOS Over 20,000 gave up the search for work in January alone. EOS BOS Nearly 300,000 more Canadians are unemployed now than before the recession. EOS BOS Will the government use tomorrow's budget to help Canadians get back to work? EOS BOS Will it increase the hiring tax credit for small businesses and restore the ecoENERGY retrofit program? EOS BOS Will it help Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, under the action taken by our Conservative government, Canada will continue to have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the G7 and one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the G7.In fact, since 2006, our government has helped put 2.1 million young Canadians back to work through job training and skills development. EOS BOS Despite this action, we recognize that more can be done. EOS BOS We look forward to the budget tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, far too many Canadians are giving up on the Conservative government because it is not creating enough jobs. EOS BOS Over 1.3 million Canadians are still out of work and are struggling to pay their bills. EOS BOS This is taking a toll on our economy. EOS BOS Conservatives might be happy to ignore this, but the IMF has raised serious concerns about the impact of skyrocketing household debt, now at $1.4 trillion, and the impact this has on our economic performance. EOS BOS Will the government take action in tomorrow's budget to make life more affordable for middle-class Canadians? EOS BOS Will it crack down on payday lenders? EOS BOS Will it ensure that people have access to a low-interest rate credit card? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we clearly do not want Canadians to be overextended. We have cautioned Canadians repeatedly that interest rates are at an all-time low and will inevitably increase. EOS BOS Our priority is to ensure that Canadians can make informed financial decisions. EOS BOS She quoted the IMF. EOS BOS Let me quote from the report:The Canadian economy strengthened in 2013.... Economic growth is expected to accelerate.... EOS BOS It also went on to say:Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued sound macroeconomic and financial sector management. EOS BOS We have had a long-term plan. EOS BOS The long-term plan is working— EOS BOS The Speaker: The hon. EOS BOS member for Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is widely known that tobacco products are deadly and for decades, Health Canada has called for stricter policies against smoking. EOS BOS Marijuana has the same carcinogenic potential to cause harm to the body. EOS BOS How can the Minister of Health, the minister responsible for promoting good health to Canadians, throw out decades of scientific research by Health Canada and promote the recreational use of marijuana? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I had the honour yesterday of speaking at the United Nations General Assembly special session on drugs. EOS BOS I used that opportunity to talk about Canada's drug policy, which is grounded in scientific evidence, and which employs a collaborative, compassionate, and comprehensive approach to drug policy. EOS BOS We are concerned about access to marijuana for young people. EOS BOS Therefore, we are going to be introducing a new regulatory regime which will keep our children safe, free from the potential harms of marijuana, and keep the profits out of the hands of criminals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, like many other members, I am disappointed that the government chose to announce its plans to legalize marijuana in New York, rather than doing it here in the House, before the elected representatives of the people of Canada. EOS BOS At this time, a number of questions remain unanswered, on top of many other troubling questions related to public health. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness tell us what he plans to do to keep this drug away from children? EOS BOS How does he plan to give police officers the tools they need to be able to arrest drug-impaired drivers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the public safety department is working very closely with the justice department and the health department to produce a regime for Canada with respect to marijuana that will, in fact, do a far better job in keeping our kids safe, keeping this product out of the hands of children and young people, and stopping the flow of illegal money to illegal gangs and organized crime. EOS BOS The regime in place today has failed miserably. EOS BOS Perpetuating the status quo is absolutely the wrong thing to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, science has shown that marijuana is linked to serious health concerns, both mentally and physically, especially for our young people under the age of 25. EOS BOS Yet, the Prime Minister still insists on pushing forward marijuana legalization. EOS BOS Would the Liberals admit to us that marijuana is in fact a causal factor for these illnesses and that their policies will not protect the Canadian children that we love? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite may be aware of the troubling statistics that show that up to a quarter of teenagers are in fact currently using marijuana. EOS BOS This is a troubling fact. EOS BOS As my colleague the Minister of Public Safety has already indicated, the current approach to marijuana is not working. EOS BOS Because of the potential risks, our government is introducing new legislation which will legalize marijuana, regulate it, and will restrict access to keep Canadians safe and to keep them healthy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is truly shameful to see how Canada has become a laughingstock in recent days because of our national security. EOS BOS For days, the Minister of Public Safety has stubbornly repeated that all is well at the Stanstead border crossing. EOS BOS He continues to ignore the situation and repeats that Bill C-31 will magically solve the problem of smugglers. EOS BOS In the meantime, 11 people managed to cross the border and were not intercepted until they reached Magog. EOS BOS It is time for the minister to realize that Bill C-31 is an utter failure and that cuts will not solve anything at the Canada Border Services Agency. EOS BOS Will the minister finally take the situation seriously and wake up once and for all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact Bill C-31 is just coming into force. EOS BOS We have not yet taken any of those measures that the act provides for. EOS BOS That member opposed Bill C-31. EOS BOS In fact, his website says that he opposes Bill C-31 and now he is calling upon the government to implement Bill C-31. EOS BOS That is the kind of hypocrisy that he should be going home and telling his constituents about, that on the one hand he supports Bill C-31 but on the other hand he does not. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for the past two weeks, representatives of the International Monetary Fund were in Canada as part of its annual consultations under IMF article IV. EOS BOS The staff of the IMF were here to survey the economic landscape and look forward to Canada's future economic development. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Finance please share his thoughts on the IMF consultations with the House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to meet with the staff of the IMF last week and to receive their report, which praised our pro-growth fiscal measures. EOS BOS We are tremendously proud of the path we are on, and we are very pleased that the international community is recognizing that what we are doing here in Canada is having a real and measurable impact. EOS BOS We are looking forward to continuing to work with the international community on inclusive growth, both here and abroad, to make a real difference for Canadians and our world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is budget time, and time for the Conservatives to make choices.Canadians are waiting to see if this budget will reflect their priorities, or if there will be more cuts to services such as food safety, employment insurance or help for our veterans. EOS BOS The Conservatives can choose to invest in ad campaigns or in real programs for Canadians. EOS BOS Will the minister confirm that he intends to cancel corporate tax cuts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there is excitement in the air. EOS BOS The NDP just cannot wait until Thursday. EOS BOS It is only three more sleeps, but I would encourage the hon. member to be patient. EOS BOS I will not speculate on what is going to be in the budget, but I will tell the hon. EOS BOS member what is not going to be in the budget, and that is the tax increases the NDP would foist on all Canadians: a $21 billion carbon tax and $56 billion in increased taxes. EOS BOS That will not be in the budget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I guess that non-answer means they are just going to keep rewarding their insider friends, but that is okay, because NDP members will keep fighting for Canadians. EOS BOS We see that Conservative priorities are actually costing Canadians. EOS BOS Worse still, the Conservative agenda is actually harming the Canadian economy, with our economy now forecast to grow at a snail's pace. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives stop priorities that only reward their friends and start working for the priorities of all Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our friends are Canadians. EOS BOS Our friends are Canadian companies. EOS BOS They are ordinary Canadians who work for those companies. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member talks about how it actually could help Canadians, but I will read a specific quote for the leader of the official opposition, who does not like quotes. EOS BOS This is from the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. EOS BOS It states: If federal tax rates had not been reduced, Canada's unemployment rate would have exceeded 9% in 2009 during the recession. EOS BOS Today, our unemployment rate would be higher than that of the United States, with 200,000— EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in February 2016, the Canada Transportation Act review report was tabled in the House. EOS BOS It recommended that Canada's foreign ownership limit be increased to 49% to allow other carriers to provide improved air transportation for Canadians. EOS BOS In spite of a strong business case, strong market demand, and the overwhelming support of airports and municipalities, including the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, the minister has chosen not to take action. EOS BOS Why is the minister standing in the way of job growth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is working collaboratively to address the recommendations of the Canada Transportation Act review and develop Canada's future transportation system. EOS BOS We are carefully considering the applications by JetLines and Enerjet in the context of developing a long-term framework for all Canadian air travellers. EOS BOS Any decision will be made in the interests of middle-class Canadian travellers and those working hard to join it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals claim to stand up for the middle class, but the recent non-action by the Minister of Transport on foreign ownership rules for air carriers means that middle-class Canadians will continue to have poor airport service and pay higher fees. EOS BOS The clear recommendation of the Canadian Transport Act review would reduce costs and give better service for middle-class Canadians who use the Waterloo regional airport in my riding of Kitchener—Conestoga. EOS BOS Why is the minister ignoring them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am certain Canadians appreciate that our government is taking an inclusive and evidence-based approach to determining the future of Canada's transportation network. EOS BOS Any travel decisions made will be in the best interests of middle-class Canadians and those working hard to join it. EOS BOS We are analyzing the application by JetLines and Enerjet for an exemption to foreign ownership limits in that context. EOS BOS In the coming months, the Minister of Transport will continue to present initiatives for a safer, cleaner, more secure and more efficient transportation sector in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Stephen Harper's Conservatives never dared to go this far. EOS BOS The Liberals want to privatize our airports and are asking for advice from Credit Suisse, which is in the infrastructure-buying business. EOS BOS The Liberals also want to privatize our ports and are asking for advice from Morgan Stanley, which also happens to be in the infrastructure-buying business. EOS BOS I think that we can already guess what the Liberals are going to do, and that means that infrastructure that is key to Canada's economic development will be at the mercy of the private sector. EOS BOS Where in their election platform did the Liberals talk about privatizing Canada's ports and airports? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have not made any decisions regarding our ports and airports. EOS BOS I can guarantee that any decisions we make in the future regarding our airports will be in the best interests of travellers. EOS BOS That is our priority. EOS BOS In the case of ports, any decisions will be in the best interest of Canada's economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the made on Bay Street infrastructure privatization plan, while good for billionaire investors, is selling out Canadian jobs. EOS BOS The Port of Churchill is a devastating example of what happened the last time the Liberals privatized strategic infrastructure. EOS BOS They virtually gave the port away to an American billionaire who has since shut it down. EOS BOS People have lost their jobs, the community's future is in question, and we are all paying the price. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stand up for jobs and stop selling us out for the gain of private infrastructure? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first I would like to take this opportunity to wish you a happy birthday before I respond to that question. EOS BOS [Members sang Happy Birthday] EOS
BOS It is hard enough to get order in here. EOS BOS Thank you. EOS BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker I hope that does not go against my time allocation. EOS BOS I want to take this opportunity again to highlight the very important initiative we put in place with regard to Churchill. EOS BOS We recognized the challenges there. EOS BOS That is why our government, through economic development, invested $4.6 million to create jobs to help the community before year-end. EOS BOS We are concerned about economic development, we care about jobs, and we are making investments and growing the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last month, UNESCO, which is supposed to be a body dedicated to historical fact, held a bizarre vote. EOS BOS UNESCO's executive board voted overwhelmingly for an offensive resolution denying Jewish history and Israel's ties to Jerusalem's Temple Mount and the Western Wall. EOS BOS Only six states, including the United States and the United Kingdom, voted against. EOS BOS Canada is not a member of UNESCO's executive board, but we have not heard a peep from the Liberals condemning this outrageous vote. EOS BOS Why not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada strongly supports Israel and strongly fights against anti-Semitism on every front. EOS BOS Canada will never do anything other than that. EOS BOS It is something that we are very committed to doing, in every circumstance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Liberals voted against the NDP's motion to immediately resolve the problem of diafiltered milk. EOS BOS Instead, the government proudly announced that it was going to spend the next 30 days conducting more consultations with producers and the industry. EOS BOS The industry has lost $18 million. EOS BOS More consultations, no action, and no promise to really solve the problem of diafiltered milk. EOS BOS Can the minister reassure producers and promise to finally solve the problem of diafiltered milk in the next 25 days? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my hon. colleague's question and concern. EOS BOS We recognize the importance of this emotional issue for the dairy farmers and we are working to reach sustainable solutions for the whole of the Canadian dairy sector. EOS BOS We will work with the dairy sector and we will come up with a solution to this issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, thousands of jobs are at stake right now because our Prime Minister and his Liberal government are failing to show leadership. EOS BOS The $7.4-billion Trans Mountain project, which has already been approved, is on the line. EOS BOS The Prime Minister does not seem to recognize the urgency of the situation. EOS BOS His failure to take action and his silence on the matter are jeopardizing the Canadian economy, provincial economies, and the jobs of Canadian families that depend on the expansion. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister tell Canadians what he is going to do to resolve the difficulties British Columbia and Alberta are having? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government approved the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline because it was in the natural interest; because of the many thousands of jobs that would be created; because of the expansion of export markets so we would not have to rely on 99% of those exports going to one country, the United States; because of the $1.5 billion we invested in the ocean protection plan, which is world-leading; and because of the consultation with indigenous communities, which are the three pillars of responsible development. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Friday, the official opposition requested an emergency debate in the interest of workers in British Columbia, Alberta, and the rest of the country. EOS BOS That request was refused even though natural resources are a pillar of our economy and thousands of families depend on those jobs. EOS BOS My question is a simple one: when will the Prime Minister step up, get to work, and show the kind of leadership that will help our natural resources sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has said unequivocally many times that this pipeline will be built, and that no province has the authority to impinge on federal jurisdiction in the national interest. EOS BOS There is only one government in Canada that speaks on behalf of Canada, and that is the Government of Canada, which it has done and will continue to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has completely failed to ensure that Trans Mountain will even get started. EOS BOS As per usual, he and the Liberals are full of empty words and very empty on action. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has done absolutely nothing to guarantee that Trans Mountain gets built, and the lack of leadership from the government has threatened jobs and interprovincial relationships. EOS BOS What is the Prime Minister going to do to ensure that construction on this pipeline begins this spring? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member knows that the Government of Canada has already intervened in a motion in front of the National Energy Board and agreed with Kinder Morgan that there ought to be at standing panel established to ensure there are no unnecessary delays in a project that, and I know the opposition agrees with us, is in the national interest. EOS BOS We have been unequivocal in our support. EOS BOS We have taken steps supporting interventions at the National Energy Board, and will be very alert to any other attempts to unnecessarily delay this project in Canada's interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been 440 days since Trans Mountain was approved and 440 days later not even a shovel in the ground. EOS BOS A trade war is starting between Alberta and B.C., and each day that goes by that tension is escalating. EOS BOS While all this is happening, where is the Prime Minister? EOS BOS He is missing in action. EOS BOS His own personal gain and vanity tour seems to trump the work he should be doing here at home. EOS BOS Once again, what is the Prime Minister's plan to get Trans Mountain started this spring? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has no interest in inflaming emotions between regions of our countries, between sectors, or from one province to another. EOS BOS The job of the Government of Canada is to speak on behalf of all Canadians. EOS BOS If the member opposite and members of the Conservative Party expect that we are going to play a game of trying to enrage and inflame regional tensions, we will not do it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not a game. EOS BOS They just have to do their jobs. EOS BOS With the Prime Minister finally back from his vanity tour in the U.S., he should finally lead on Trans Mountain and outline his plan for action, but he is still keeping Canadians in the dark. EOS BOS There is not even a glimmer of a plan, and without one, the interprovincial trade war gets worse. EOS BOS Every day, Canadians and small businesses are caught in the crossfire. EOS BOS It is the same empty rhetoric that someday, somehow this pipeline will magically get built. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister take this opportunity and finally announce the date when Trans Mountain construction will start? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, was the town hall in Edmonton in the dark? EOS BOS I think there were cameras there. EOS BOS There were microphones there. EOS BOS People were taking pictures of it. EOS BOS They were recording what the Prime Minister said, which was that this pipeline will be built. EOS BOS This has been unequivocal. EOS BOS We have intervened at the National Energy Board when there have been attempts made to slow the process down. EOS BOS We understand that this is a project that is going to create jobs, expand export markets, and invest heavily in ocean protection with the partnership of indigenous people. EOS BOS This is responsible national policy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is still sitting down and will not step in to ensure this pipeline gets built. EOS BOS Without a real concrete plan, his words and the minister's words are meaningless. EOS BOS Clearly, the government's approval even for a pipeline that is obviously in the national interest, which it has said over and over, means absolutely nothing. EOS BOS He cannot just wish the pipeline into existence. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has to actually get involved and tell Canadians what he is going to do. EOS BOS Wishful thinking and sunny ways do not build pipelines. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister refuse to make it clear to Canadians when Trans Mountain is going to get built? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, why does the hon. EOS BOS member refuse to hear what the Prime Minister has said over and over again. EOS BOS He has said, and we have said, continuously, that we will not allow any province to impinge on the federal government's jurisdiction over the national interest. EOS BOS It is not profitable for us to deal in hypotheticals of what a government might do. EOS BOS We will act when the government acts, and we will act for all Canadians, not one region, not one sector, not one province. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge, tourism is an essential part of the local economy. EOS BOS With sites like Canada's Wonderland, the Ontario Soccer Centre, Magnotta Winery, The National Golf Club of Canada, and unique conservation areas, tourists from America and around the world have plenty of attractions to choose from. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Small Business and Tourism tell the House what the government is doing to encourage more American tourists to visit Canadian destinations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his hard work, especially to his constituents, and also for highlighting the fact that the tourism industry benefits each and every one of our communities and local economies. EOS BOS Each of us in the House, regardless of party, has something in each community that is worth showing off. EOS BOS That is why budget 2016 provides an additional $50 million to Destination Canada to promote the Canadian brand in the U.S. and other key markets. EOS BOS This is a $90-billion industry, and the government's investment in the tourism industry will support small business, tourism operators, and help grow the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Halifax and Dartmouth have welcomed the Prime Minister and numerous ministers since January. EOS BOS We witnessed a new level of respect for Atlantic Canada from our government. EOS BOS This government understands that Atlantic Canada has a culture of hard work and innovation. EOS BOS In fact, the finance minister kicked off his pre-budget consultations in Nova Scotia. EOS BOS Would the minister please tell us about the positive change the budget would bring to middle-class Nova Scotian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to be able to go to Nova Scotia to start our pre-budget consultations. EOS BOS Coming from a province that has a huge number of universities, we know that our investment in research infrastructure in universities will make a difference in Nova Scotia. EOS BOS Budget 2016 is a bold plan. EOS BOS It will help middle-class families and those struggling to join the middle class. EOS BOS Efforts like the Canada child benefit and the top-up to the GIS will help families in Dartmouth— EOS BOS Cole Harbour and across Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, four Canadians are among the more than 500 people killed by the devastating earthquake in Ecuador. EOS BOS Hundreds are missing and thousands need emergency assistance now. EOS BOS Conservatives acquired the C-17 strategic airlift aircraft to enable the disaster response team to respond to disasters around the world. EOS BOS Ecuador is calling for more assistance from the international community. EOS BOS Instead of using aid money to buy votes at the UN, why do the Liberals not rise to the occasion and help the people of Ecuador by increasing Canada's commitment now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have already allocated $1 million to help with the situation in Ecuador and help meet immediate humanitarian needs. EOS BOS Our consular team is assisting the grieving families at this time. EOS BOS We sent a team of three Global Affairs Canada staff and three Department of National Defence personnel to assess the needs. EOS BOS We will take the appropriate action as soon as we receive their recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning StatsCan delivered some bad news for Canadians. EOS BOS Economic growth was zero in July. EOS BOS Our stalled economy means we do not have enough good jobs. EOS BOS Canada lost a staggering 112,000 private sector jobs in August. EOS BOS According to the OECD, Canada ranks a dismal 16th out of 34 when it comes to employment. EOS BOS Even the Minister of Finance admits this is not good enough, at least when he is out of the country. EOS BOS He confessed in New York today that “ EOS BOS We'd like to grow faster”, so where is his plan for growth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is focused on what matters to Canadians. EOS BOS That is jobs and economic growth. EOS BOS The report she has referenced also reminds us that our economy has seen six consecutive months of growth, but we know that the global recovery and the global economy remain fragile. EOS BOS That is why we must stay the course. EOS BOS Our low-tax plan for jobs and growth is working. EOS BOS The report also showed that manufacturing showed strength and growth in the last month as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government remains out of touch with the needs of middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS In Ontario, families are struggling to make ends meet, and even the government's so-called favourite economist, the Prime Minister, says that employment has flattened recently. EOS BOS As I stated yesterday, the minister of state for economic development has only spent $79,000 out of his $177-million budget to stimulate Ontario's economy. EOS BOS When will the minister acknowledge his inaction plan and do something? EOS BOS If not, will the Prime Minister replace him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, StatsCan has confirmed that families are better off under the Conservative government than under all previous Liberal governments. EOS BOS Median net worth for Canadians has increased by 45% since we took office. EOS BOS Canadian families in all income groups have seen increases of about 10% in their take-home pay. EOS BOS The lowest-income families have seen an increase of 14%.Despite the Liberal leader's on-the-fly promise to reverse our tax cuts, the government will continue to keep taxes low for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us go from Bay Street to Attawapiskat. EOS BOS The chief of Attawapiskat was once again forced to declare a state of emergency on Saturday, following a rash of suicide attempts by young people in his community. EOS BOS While the Prime Minister talks about how saddened he is by the situation, the fact is that it is getting worse and nothing is being done about it. EOS BOS The government refused to conduct an inquiry, and requests for mental heath services are often denied. EOS BOS The government is turning its back on young people. EOS BOS When will the government take action and put an end to this tragedy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and for changing the topic in the House. EOS BOS This is one of the most serious and pressing tragedies that our nation is facing. EOS BOS I am devastated by the situation that is taking place in Attawapiskat. EOS BOS I am working with my colleague the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs to respond to this tragedy. EOS BOS I was in conversation yesterday with National Chief Bellegarde. EOS BOS I spoke today with Chief Shisheesh from Attawapiskat. EOS BOS We now have five new mental health workers in the community. EOS BOS We are responding to both the immediate needs and long-term needs of this community. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as parliamentarians, our primary responsibility is to make sure children in this country have hope, and we are failing them. EOS BOS I want to thank the minister for her positive words on Attawapiskat, but as the community said to me this morning, it should not take a state of emergency to get mental health workers to fly into a region that has had 700-plus suicide attempts. EOS BOS There is no money in the budget for mental health services for indigenous children. EOS BOS I have this question for the minister. EOS BOS What is it going to take to end this cycle of crisis and death among young people? EOS BOS What are the concrete steps for the long term that the Liberals are going to put on the ground, not just in Attawapiskat but in all the indigenous communities of this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member will find no argument with me that in fact we need to find a way to restore hope for these communities and particularly for the young people who consider taking their lives. EOS BOS In fact, as the hon. member may know, the budget includes $8.4 billion in funding for indigenous communities. EOS BOS It is these funds that would actually restore hope to communities. EOS BOS When we invest in education, so that these young people will have a standard of education that every Canadian child should have, it will renew hope. EOS BOS When we invest in these communities, so that people will have adequate housing and not be faced with overcrowding, we will find hope. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government seems to be having problems delivering on their promises to Syrian refugees. EOS BOS Some refugee families in Saskatoon waited nearly three weeks without money for food or rent. EOS BOS They had to rely on charity just to feed their families and avoid being evicted. EOS BOS They said they are frustrated, worried, embarrassed, and feel like they have to beg to survive. EOS BOS This is not acceptable. EOS BOS How many other families are in this situation, and what action will the minister take to ensure this does not happen to anyone else? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times, an operation of this kind is never perfect. EOS BOS There are always bumps along the road. EOS BOS There are always problems of various kinds, but overall, I am satisfied. EOS BOS I just heard today that 90% of the refugees now have permanent housing. EOS BOS I wish those individuals to whom the member referred great success, but I am pleased to say that overall, thanks to the generosity of so many Canadians, this operation is going well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is another area of mismanagement, and that is the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency. EOS BOS It is just another example of the government's mismanagement. EOS BOS The Auditor General reported it failed to assess the project eligibility, failed to require reports from recipients, and even failed to measure its own performance, like the receipt for a $31,000 truck, oops, missing. EOS BOS Yet is anyone held to account? EOS BOS No, not in the least. EOS BOS Is the minister aware that CanNor is being used as a potential slush fund in northern Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency accepts the Auditor General's recommendations. EOS BOS I have given the agency clear instructions to immediately improve its administrative procedures. EOS BOS We will continue to make record investments in the north so that northerners can foster a strong economic northern economy to create jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity for the benefit of all northerners and Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Équiterre and the David Suzuki Foundation support the petition against energy east. EOS BOS Like the UPA and millions of Quebeckers, they rightly oppose this project, which threatens our lands and waterways. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the Liberal government does not want to listen and is turning a blind eye to this growing opposition in Quebec. EOS BOS Will the 40 government members from Quebec continue to support TransCanada or will they stand up for the interests of Quebeckers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the application to build the energy east pipeline has not yet been lodged with the regulator, the National Energy Board. EOS BOS There will be many months of public discussion when the hon. EOS BOS member will be encouraged to appear in front of the board, to write a letter, to visit a website, to have conversations with the community about her attitude about whether or not that pipeline is in the national interest. EOS BOS To ask the government to offer an opinion before it is before the regulator is irresponsible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it was bad enough last week when Canada was not invited to the anti-ISIS meeting in Paris. EOS BOS The Liberal government was snubbed because it expects other nations to fight terrorism while it cuts and runs, taking out our CF-18s without a plan. EOS BOS Then late last week, the rookie Minister of National Defence blamed our allies for the spread of terrorism. EOS BOS Instead of condescendingly lecturing our allies, why does the defence minister not finally tell us how he will use our military in the fight against ISIS? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I learned my lessons working with our allies. EOS BOS Indeed, what I said in my speech at Canada 2020 is that when I was actually working with them I learned about the issues that allow radical organizations to take advantage of certain issues and then our having to form coalitions after the fact. EOS BOS What I want to ask the member opposite is where was his government in looking at those issues? Why did it allow the issues to get so big and not attack ISIL when it was a small organization? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we had a plan, a plan that was respected by our allies. EOS BOS Last week resembled a blast from the past, a time a former Trudeau government would cozy up to communist regimes and chastise our allies. EOS BOS Last week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated that Canada was going to normalize relations with totalitarian regimes like Iran and Russia, and then on Friday, our rookie Minister of National Defence suggested our allies were to blame for all that is wrong in the Middle East and the spread of terrorism. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals lecturing our allies on how to fight terrorism while at the same time befriending Putin and Iran? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is about consulting our allies and having a dialogue. EOS BOS These lessons, as I stated, were learned while working with our coalition partners and that is the plan that we will be putting forward, making sure that we get this right so we do not make the mistakes of the previous 10 years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I just got back from a NATO Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Washington. EOS BOS Contrary to what the government says, members of Congress and the U.S. State Department are very disappointed that Canadian fighter planes have been withdrawn from Iraq and Syria. EOS BOS Why is the government bent on ignoring our allies in the fight against the so-called Islamic State? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member stated, we are committed to ending the air strikes. EOS BOS However, we have taken the time to make sure that we check out the entire situation. EOS BOS I have visited the region twice. EOS BOS I have spoken with our allies and I have spoken with my counterparts. EOS BOS When we come out with our plan, it is going to be to ensure that we not only have a positive impact but that it will impact our allies and make a contribution for years to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, 45 people were killed and 110 more were injured in an attack in Damascus for which ISIS claimed responsibility, but the Minister of National Defence says that his plan is not ready. Seriously?If the Liberals cannot come up with a plan, why should Canadians trust this government to keep them safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have to make sure that we take our time with this, make sure that we consult our allies, and make sure that we assess what the enemy situation is. EOS BOS I want to make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, because every single time we make those mistakes as political leaders, we send our men and women into harm's way for no reason. EOS BOS I will not repeat those mistakes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador have been hit hard by the global downturn in oil prices, as reflected in the province's recent budget. EOS BOS I am hearing time and again from my constituents in St. John's South—Mount Pearl that middle-class families are feeling squeezed. EOS BOS They are worried about what the future holds for them and what it holds for their neighbours. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance please share with the House the work that he is doing to help the people of Newfoundland and Labrador? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government stands firmly with the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. EOS BOS I was pleased that we were able to deliver a $32-million stabilized payment to people in that province. EOS BOS More importantly, our Canada child benefit, our tax cuts, and our increase to the guaranteed income supplement are going to help people in Newfoundland and Labrador with more money in their pockets. EOS BOS Moving forward, our new Canada building fund will be more rapid and flexible in delivering infrastructure projects to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, helping that province in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a number of experts and legal professionals have serious concerns about the constitutionality of Bill C-14. EOS BOS The legislation could be challenged in court, but in committee, the Liberals have rejected nearly all of the amendments that would have fixed the bill. EOS BOS What is preventing the Prime Minister from seeking the Supreme Court's opinion on Bill C-14? EOS BOS [English]With so many raising concerns about the constitutionality of Bill C-14, why will the Prime Minister not simply refer the bill to the Supreme Court to avoid years of legal challenges. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on Bill C-14, Canadians understand that this is an important and big step in our nation's history as we move forward on a delicate issue under a time crunch by the Supreme Court. EOS BOS One of the things Canadians expect is that we take this very seriously and responsibly, and that is exactly what we are doing before committee, and that is what we have been doing with these consultations. EOS BOS The NDP has put forward amendments to enlarge the scope of the allowances. EOS BOS The Conservatives are putting forward amendments to further restrict it. EOS BOS We are listening to all proposals. EOS BOS We are working hard to ensure that Canadians have the right legal framework to help them with these incredibly personal and sensitive decisions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are trampling on the taxpayer bill of rights. EOS BOS Article 6 states that, “ EOS BOS You have the right to complete, accurate, clear, and timely information. EOS BOS ” A survey conducted by the Canada Revenue Agency showed that ever since all the service counters closed, a company has to call three times on average before getting a response. EOS BOS When companies did manage to reach someone, they were given incorrect information one out of four times. EOS BOS Is that what the minister calls accurate, complete and timely information? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, these results are unacceptable. EOS BOS We agree that when Canadian individuals and businesses contact the Canada Revenue Agency, we expect them to be provided with correct information. EOS BOS We encourage people who believe they have received incorrect information from the CRA to make a formal complaint. EOS BOS We expect the CRA to continuously improve the quality and accuracy of the telephone services it is providing. EOS BOS We have implemented several measures to improve the quality of services offered by the Canada Revenue Agency. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada 2020, a Liberal think tank associated with Liberal lobbyists and good friends of the Liberal Prime Minister, recently introduced a donor agreement to prevent accusations of cash for access for events it holds with Liberal ministers. EOS BOS It is really sad that the Liberals' actions make such agreements necessary. EOS BOS In light of this revelation, why can the Prime Minister not see that even his friends are embarrassed by his fundraising techniques and fear for their own reputations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague across the aisle knows very well that at all times political parties are raising money. EOS BOS They do so according to Canadian law. EOS BOS He knows very well that only Canadian citizens can contribute to these fundraising events. EOS BOS He also knows that all donations of over $200 are proactively disclosed by the election authorities. EOS BOS He also knows, or should know, that the Liberal Party follows all of the election rules, and that is what removes even the suggestion of a conflict of interest. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for weeks now, we have demanded that the Liberals stop peddling cabinet access to their friends and lobbyists. EOS BOS Fresh off his trip to visit old family friends in Cuba, we learned that the Prime Minister was cozying up to Chinese Communist Party officials who attended a cash for access fundraiser in May. These same officials then made a large payment to the Trudeau Foundation. EOS BOS Has this Prime Minister no shame? EOS BOS I know he admires dictatorships from Havana to Beijing, but this goes too far. EOS BOS Will he stop selling influence to foreign powers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague can manufacture outrage as much as he wants. EOS BOS He knows very well that only Canadian citizens can make donations to political parties in Canada. EOS BOS Those are rules that all political parties follow. EOS BOS He knows that the Trudeau Foundation is an independent foundation. EOS BOS He knows that that particular donation to which he made reference began in January 2014. EOS BOS He knows that very well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what he is not saying is when the cheque was written. EOS BOS This government is trying to defend the indefensible. EOS BOS It is hiding behind a law written for all parliamentarians to claim that it is obeying the law. EOS BOS We are all familiar with the saying that just because it is legal does not mean it is ethical. EOS BOS The Minister of Justice invited lawyers to a cocktail party. EOS BOS If they are ambitious they will attend, because when she appoints judges she will think of the Liberal Party's friends. EOS BOS Will this government respect the House and stop the intimidation with its political fundraising? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is proud of enhancing the transparency of judicial appointments. EOS BOS My Conservative colleague claims that our judicial appointments are not made in an open and transparent manner. EOS BOS However, he knows very well that that is not true. EOS BOS We changed the process in order to increase transparency and to make outstanding Canadians eligible for appointment. EOS BOS We are proud of that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have my doubts about what my colleague just said EOS BOS . I could go on with the long list of ministers who take donors hostage. EOS BOS Worse still is the fact that the Prime Minister himself is involved in this sketchy kind of fundraising, the very same Prime Minister who told his ministers not to get involved in this kind of thing. EOS BOS They should really walk the talk. EOS BOS This is serious. EOS BOS This government has no ethics and could not care less about rules. EOS BOS Will the Liberals stop holding these sketchy fundraising events? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if my colleague wants to talk about lack of ethics and sketchy fundraising activities, maybe he should think about what his government did when it appointed people like Mike Duffy, Irving Gerstein, and Pamela Wallin to the Senate specifically to do fundraising for the Conservative Party at taxpayers' expense. EOS BOS That is something our government will never do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in response to a question about the Liberals spending over $23,000 on an external public relations consultant for Kathleen Wynne, for her trip to Israel, the foreign affairs minister said these services are available to anyone. EOS BOS Seriously, anyone can get a free $23,000 PR guy funded by the Liberals? EOS BOS No wonder they have no hope of balancing this budget. EOS BOS Why will the minister not simply admit that Kathleen Wynne got the money because she is a Liberal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a service that is available to any province of any political orientation, of course. EOS BOS However, since my colleague is asking the question about what this trip gave to Canada: 44 commercial agreements; $118 million; 200 jobs in Ontario. EOS BOS Other provinces have benefited from the same service. EOS BOS Is the member opposite suggesting we should not help our provinces access foreign commercial markets?Israel has benefited from this visit. EOS BOS Is the member opposite suggesting we weaken ties with Israel? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what the member is suggesting is that the federal government not pay Ontario's bills. EOS BOS Yesterday, I asked the foreign affairs minister about the federal Liberals paying a private public relations firm $23,000 for Kathleen Wynne's recent trip to Israel. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS The amount of money he speaks about is an amount of money that was available to anyone....” What a ridiculous answer. EOS BOS That money is not available to anyone unless their circle of friends includes the Prime Minister, Gerald Butts, and Katie Telford. EOS BOS Canadian taxpayers want to know why the federal Liberals paid for Kathleen Wynne's public relations bills. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I guess my colleague was sleeping when I just spoke, so I will repeat myself. EOS BOS This is a service available to any province, and we do not look at the political affiliation of the province. EOS BOS That is ridiculous as a statement. EOS BOS He would be unable to substantiate it. EOS BOS Did he not hear me describe 44 commercial agreements; $118 million; 200 jobs in Ontario; stronger links with Israel? EOS BOS If he has a problem with that, I want to know why. EOS
BOS I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of His Excellency Manuel A. González Sanz, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Costa Rica. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS I would also like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of the Right Honourable Edward Richard Schreyer, 22nd Governor General of Canada. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when we change the basic rules of democracy, everyone should get a vote, but the Prime Minister seems to think that only those who agree with him should get a say. EOS BOS He clearly opposes directly consulting Canadians through a referendum on fundamental changes to how we vote. EOS BOS He told students at the University of Ottawa, “... EOS BOS the fact is that referendums are a pretty good way of not getting any electoral reform.”Has the Prime Minister closed the door on a referendum because he thinks the only opinion that matters is his? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the previous government, we intend to use evidence and a complete consultation process with Canadians across this great nation so that when we propose changes in this House, we bring our democratic institutions— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Can we have some order, please. EOS BOS We want to hear the answer from the Minister of Democratic Institutions. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will base our decisions on evidence and a complete conversation, an inclusive and meaningful conversation with Canadians across this great nation so that we can bring our democratic institution into the 21st century. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 1,200 indigenous women and girls are missing or have been murdered in Canada. EOS BOS Families of the victims are coming together today in Ottawa to prepare for tomorrow's national round table. EOS BOS They are looking for answers and they are looking for concrete coordinated action. EOS BOS So far, all they have heard are the same empty lines from the government. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister take the opportunity that is offered to him today? EOS BOS Will he listen to the families? EOS BOS Will he change his rhetoric and finally recognize the need for a national public inquiry? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has been acting on a multi-pronged action plan to deal with this problem, beginning first and foremost with cracking down on violent crime. EOS BOS We are also funding shelters and family violence preventions to protect women and children, supporting dedicated RCMP project teams and the development of community safety plans, supporting a national centre for missing persons, providing additional investigative tools for the police, and providing additional rights for Canadian women who live on reserve in the form of matrimonial property rights and human rights. EOS BOS Now is the time for action, not for more NDP study. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not an either-or choice between investment and an inquiry. EOS BOS Families deserve both actions to end this crisis and answers to help them get much-needed closure. EOS BOS I want to know what the government is still waiting for to finally commit to concrete actions with its provincial and territorial counterparts and call for a national public inquiry. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister just said, we are taking action, whether that be safety programs on reserves or providing matrimonial property rights to aboriginal women. EOS BOS Maybe that might be just making sure they have a supportive shelter to go to when they are in their time of need. EOS BOS Now is the time for action, not for another study, such as the one the NDP wants. EOS BOS Now is the time to stand up for these women who have experienced these violent crimes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, section 35 of the Constitution protects the rights of aboriginal peoples. EOS BOS Most aboriginal people feel that Bill C-51 threatens that protection. EOS BOS Given how often law enforcement has described our demonstrations as illegal, I cannot help but be concerned that we will be lumped in with terrorists. EOS BOS Will the minister realize that Bill C-51 is unconstitutional and threatens the rights of aboriginal peoples? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first, we have the greatest respect for aboriginal peoples. EOS BOS We respect the rights of all Canadians. EOS BOS Nonetheless, we also have a responsibility to oppose terrorism, violence and Criminal Code offences. EOS BOS Again, I invite the member to consult Bill C-51, where it is clearly indicated that peaceful protest is exempt. EOS BOS I invite him to reread the bill. EOS BOS If he needs help, we can go to committee. EOS BOS The NDP can stop obstructing the process and we can talk about the bill in committee. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on May 15, the Prime Minister announced an infrastructure program to mark Canada's 150th anniversary and invited all municipalities to participate. EOS BOS Municipalities in Quebec, including Ahuntsic-Cartierville, will be excluded from the program even though Quebec's Minister of Municipal Affairs submitted a memorandum of understanding. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs sign the MOU? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I explained earlier, our government is very proud to have established the Canada 150 community infrastructure program. EOS BOS It will help to preserve and improve treasured cultural and community locations, not only through the province of Quebec but across the country. EOS BOS We look forward to working with not-for-profit organizations in the province of Quebec and across the country to renew important recreational infrastructure in our communities and to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the dance of complacency continues. EOS BOS My last question has to do with this being National Aboriginal Day and the fact that we are celebrating as well the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. EOS BOS One of the things the government has to recognize is that one of the most significant claims that has not been recognized or resolved is the Haldimand Tract claim. EOS BOS This claim dates specifically from commitments that were made by the Crown to the Six Nations with respect to their support for the Crown in the War of 1812. EOS BOS This dispute carries on. EOS BOS It lies at the heart of many other contemporary disputes. EOS BOS Will the government finally recognize the need to resolve it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has been in negotiations with its partners on this for some years now, and we will continue to work productively with our partners to try to resolve this dispute. EOS BOS At the same time, this government is the government that brought in the new specific claims legislation advocated by the Assembly of First Nations. EOS BOS It has seen a record number of specific claims settled across the country. EOS BOS On this anniversary of the War of 1812, in all our events we of course recognize the very important role played by aboriginal peoples and first nations in that very successful war that helped establish this Canadian nation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have used every divisive fearmongering tactic available to try to convince Canadians their overreaching Bill C-51 is necessary, but Canadians know better. EOS BOS They know this just is not true. EOS BOS Canadians have even taken to the streets across Canada, saying loudly and clearly that Bill C-51 is an attack on our freedoms and it will not keep us any safer. EOS BOS Why is the minister refusing to listen to the concerns of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the anti-terrorism bill is targeting terrorists, not lawful protesters who are specifically excluded from the bill. EOS BOS I invite the member to listen to the witness who will appear in the committee tonight. EOS BOS I understand the committee will hear the daughter of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent. EOS BOS I hope the member will understand that Canadians need to be protected against the international jihadi terrorists. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the minister is asking people to listen, we would ask him to listen to the Canadian Bar Association, which has serious concerns about the bill. EOS BOS In fact, it has called it ill-considered. EOS BOS It goes on to say that this bill brings the entire charter into jeopardy, undermines the rule of law, and goes against the fundamental role of judges as the protectors of Canada's constitutional rights. EOS BOS Why is the minister refusing to listen to expert testimony, ignoring our nation's lawyers and continuing to ram this dangerous bill through the House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, despite the hyperbole and the hyperventilating, we are doing no such thing. EOS BOS We are listening to experts. EOS BOS We are listening to many experts, including the Bar Association, but let us be clear on the role of judges here. EOS BOS There is no greater authority than to involve the judges, to preview some of the applications that are made with words. EOS BOS By the way, members of the Bar Association here and around the country would know that judges do this every day in the exercise of their authority. EOS BOS That is exactly what I would ask the hon. EOS BOS member and members of the Bar Association to revisit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the forestry sector is vitally important to the Canadian economy and particularly to my riding of Cariboo—Prince George. EOS BOS Our Conservative government is focused on creating jobs and economic growth. EOS BOS That is why we have made unprecedented investments to renew and sustain Canada's forestry sector. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Natural Resources update the House on what action we are taking to promote this important economic sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank the member for Cariboo—Prince George for two decades of leadership in forest policy for our caucus and in this place. EOS BOS We will focus on supporting innovation and pursuing new export opportunities for Canadian wood products. EOS BOS That is why last week I signed a memorandum of understanding in Korea to enhance our forestry co-operation on technology and innovation, and in keeping with our free trade agreement with Korea, creating more opportunity for export of our forest products. EOS BOS We will continue to showcase, celebrate and give Canada's forest sector the support it rightly deserves. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is worse than just one meeting. EOS BOS The government House leader's new adviser is not really new at all, especially when it comes to dealing with the Irving family. EOS BOS Kevin Fram has already been in hot water for trips he accepted to the Irving fish camp. EOS BOS Now he is working for the senior New Brunswick minister, who is supposed to have no dealings with the Irvings at all. EOS BOS How can the minister have an ethical screen to the Irvings when both he and his senior staff are so closely tied to them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there is another fan of Phoebe Gilman's book, Something from Nothing. EOS BOS Regarding the two meetings. EOS BOS I attended one of the meetings on January 17 with Mr. Fram, and it involved a not-for-profit organization called CAST, or Collaboration for Atlantic Salmon Tomorrow. EOS BOS The other meeting involving my acting chief of staff, Mr. Fram, was on January 20. EOS BOS It was a high level meeting on shipbuilding. EOS BOS I asked him to attend on my behalf because I was in meetings in Quebec City. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has claimed over and over again that the G8 projects came in on budget. EOS BOS However, now we learn that projects in Huntsville came in at over $5 million more than projected. EOS BOS Huntsville will need to raise its taxes to pay its part of the G8 slush fund. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives say that the project came in on budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce to members of the House that of the 23,000 projects that this government funded under Canada's economic action plan, we did not pay one cent of money over budget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, no matter how much the government insists that all expenses were justified, the fact remains that the President of the Treasury Board refused to provide all documentation to the Auditor General during her investigation. EOS BOS The three amigos—the minister, the mayor and the hotel manager—recommended projects without providing the necessary documentation. EOS BOS Will the President of the Treasury Board commit to handing all documentation in his possession over to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Infrastructure Canada and the Government of Canada co-operated fully with the good work of the Auditor General. EOS BOS Throughout her 10 years as Auditor General, Sheila Fraser did an outstanding job fighting for the interests of taxpayers. EOS BOS She came forward with a solid report, which made a good number of observations on how this government could do things better, on how this government could be more open and on how this government could be more transparent to Parliament. EOS BOS This government has accepted every one of her recommendations in this regard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, we learned that the U.S. commerce department has made its final decision regarding the duties that will be imposed on Canadian softwood lumber. EOS BOS Export duties of up to 21% will jeopardize 11,000 jobs in Saguenay— EOS BOS Lac-Saint-Jean. EOS BOS The government knew that this decision was imminent, but the Liberals continue to slip up and have made little to no progress when it comes to protecting the softwood lumber industry. EOS BOS When will they take charge of the situation and save these jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the punitive duties imposed by the U.S. commerce department are unfair and deeply troubling. EOS BOS Our forestry industry has never been found guilty in previous cases. EOS BOS We will challenge this decision before the courts and we will win, as we have done on every past occasion. EOS BOS We want a good agreement for Canada, not just any deal. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, concerns are being raised by first nations that new federal contribution agreements include a clause that prohibits challenging government legislation through the courts. EOS BOS Surely the new minister understands how completely inappropriate it would be for the government to hold first nations funding hostage to such an undemocratic condition. EOS BOS Will the minister confirm today whether any Government of Canada contribution agreements with first nations contain a direct or indirect threat to bar their access to the courts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, these accusations are completely false. EOS BOS Changes to the funding agreements are solely administrative and do not create new obligations for first nations. EOS BOS Our department is in contact with concerned first nations and encourages any first nation with questions and concerns to contact its local regional office. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today we learned that Canadian special forces recently came under fire in a battle near Mosul in Iraq. EOS BOS This directly contradicts the Prime Minister's claims that Canada is only doing training. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we have been clear that Canada should be taking the fight to ISIS, but it was the Liberals who, for purely political reasons, claimed that all we would be doing is training, insinuating that this would be much safer. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister claim this is just a training mission when our troops are under fire? EOS </s> BOS What we have said from the beginning, Mr. Speaker, is that Canada has an important role to play as part of the coalition against ISIL. EOS BOS Indeed, training on the ground, advising and assisting local troops, and being able to bring the fight effectively to ISIL and reclaim their lands and territories is exactly what we have committed to do. EOS BOS On top of that, we are adding extra intelligence and medical support to ensure that Canada has the best impact in empowering local troops to defeat ISIL. EOS BOS That is what we committed to do and that is exactly what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our troops are doing extraordinary work in the fight against ISIS, but the Liberals have put them into a more dangerous mission, tried to call it training, and have withdrawn our CF-18s that are a key pillar to degrade the enemy. EOS BOS Make no mistake, if our troops come under fire, they should always respond with overwhelming force, but what the government should not do is mislead Canadians about the nature of this mission. EOS BOS It is more dangerous and it is combat. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister finally prepared to admit that Canada's mission in Iraq is combat? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the mission in Iraq is support and assist, and that is exactly what it is. EOS BOS It is focused on training. EOS BOS It is not a direct combat mission. EOS BOS It is not a combat mission, it is focused on empowering local troops to counter ISIL, but, of course, Canadian troops will always be allowed to defend themselves while they support local troops taking the fight to ISIL. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance should be using the budget to finally make significant investments in a stronger middle class. EOS BOS Instead, he appears to be using it to bully and advance his own political vendettas against the Province of Ontario. EOS BOS While the minister has never hidden his disdain for the Government of Ontario, it is Ontarians who are now facing a $641-million cut in transfer payments with no funding to help bridge the shortfall. EOS BOS Ontarians have always paid their fair share, so why is the Minister of Finance now trying to balance the books on their backs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, federal support for Ontario has increased by 76% since our government took office in 2006. EOS BOS Federal support will total $19.1 billion in 2014-15, a whopping $8.3-billion increase from under the previous Liberal government. EOS BOS After years of inaction by the previous Liberal government, our Conservative government took real action to support Ontario. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year the Conservative budget delivered a fake jobs grant, cut services to veterans, and slashed the government's shaky infrastructure commitment. EOS BOS It also attacked the middle class by increasing payroll taxes and added new fees on everyday items that we all use, like shampoo, deodorant, blankets, and toothbrushes. EOS BOS Economic growth is down again. EOS BOS Job creation is clearly stagnant and Canadians are tired of ads promising much and delivering nothing. EOS BOS What will we expect in tomorrow's budget? EOS BOS More attacks on middle-class Canadians or what? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, thanks to the economic action plan Canada has enjoyed the strongest economic performance among all G7 countries, with over one million net new jobs created since the peak of the recession, and 85% of those are full-time jobs and 80% of those are in the private sector. EOS BOS These are high-paying jobs. EOS BOS The IMF and the OECD both project that Canada will have among the strongest growth in the G7 in the years ahead. EOS BOS We have a strong plan. EOS BOS We will hear more about that plan tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's budget bill is over 100 pages and amends 35 bills. EOS BOS As they say, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is an omnibus budget bill. EOS BOS Unemployed workers in Edmonton, southern Saskatchewan, and Winnipeg are hurting right now, and the Liberals are hiding measures they could take in this omnibus budget bill. EOS BOS Will the government agree to split this bill so that changes to EI, veterans benefits, seniors support, and banking regulation all get the proper study they deserve? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we want to be very clear and open with Canadians. EOS BOS The measures in our budget are all in our budget implementation act. EOS BOS There are measures there that are just related to our budget. EOS BOS We know that is the appropriate way to move forward. EOS BOS We have an ambitious plan that has measures that are going to make a real difference for Canadians, and that is exactly why the budget has the number of pages it does, which allows Canadians to understand what we are trying to do to improve our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think all members of the House are aware of the growing humanitarian crisis created by the ongoing and very difficult hostilities in Syria. EOS BOS There are over one million refugees in camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and there is inadequate help for those people who are caught up in the conflict. EOS BOS Acknowledging that the government has increased financial contributions to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, what more can the government do? EOS BOS Is there a possibility of providing emergency assistance to those refugees with connections to Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are obviously all deeply troubled by the humanitarian situation in Syria, which just gets progressively worse. EOS BOS We are not only worried about the situation in Syria, but, frankly, the wider instability that threatens the rest of the region. EOS BOS That is why, as the leader of the Green Party has noted, the government has brought forward some specific help to Syria and to some of its neighbours as well. EOS BOS We continue, through various agencies of the government and through working with our allies, to look at ways that we can help further. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the online activity of Canadian companies has reportedly more than doubled in six years and it generated an estimated $136 billion in 2013. EOS BOS That represents 7% of the gross domestic product and this figure continues to grow. EOS BOS Given the enormous potential that e-commerce represents for small, medium, and large businesses, what government measures and initiatives are in place to support innovation and to help our Canadian companies enter the market? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for her question and for the work she does with small businesses.
							[English]E-commerce is increasing at an amazing rate. EOS BOS It represents a huge opportunity for Canadian entrepreneurs. EOS BOS One of my constituents in Waterloo runs her own business making custom jewellery. EOS BOS Do members know where her best customers are? EOS BOS They are in California and Florida. EOS BOS Why is that? EOS BOS It is because with e-commerce the entire world is the marketplace. EOS BOS That is why our government has committed $500 million to expand and improve broadband services in rural and remote areas, because Canadians' entrepreneurial spirit should not be limited by where they live. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a vast majority of Canadians oppose the Liberals charging $1,500 to meet privately with the Prime Minister and senior cabinet minister, but things are getting worse. EOS BOS Reports today detail that major corporations lobbying the Liberals for favours are at the same time making massive donations to the Trudeau Foundation. EOS BOS In fact, since the Prime Minister came to power, money has rained down on the foundation. EOS BOS Canadians detest corruption. EOS BOS When these big companies are lobbying the Prime Minister, is he giving them the wink, wink, nudge, nudge, to donate to the Trudeau Foundation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to stand in this House once again to remind all members and Canadians that when it comes to political financing, we have some of the strictest rules across the country. EOS BOS It is also important to note that only individuals can donate. EOS BOS The federal rules clearly state that parties cannot take money from trade associations, unions, or corporations. EOS BOS This government and this party will continue to follow the rules. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister promised that he would be open and transparent. EOS BOS It seems like he is only open if people pay the $1,500 cash for access entry fee, but if they cannot do that, they could always kick in a bunch of cash to the Trudeau Foundation. EOS BOS The Liberals claims that the Prime Minister's open and accountable rules would be enforced by the Privy Council Office, so I asked the Privy Council Office who exactly in the office enforces these rules. EOS BOS It turns out that it is no one. EOS BOS Its response was, “ EOS BOS PCO is not an investigative body. EOS BOS ” 
              When will the Prime Minister finally admit that he has deceived Canadians and that no one is enforcing his own rules? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said time and time again, and will have to continue to say, as the member does not seem to want to hear my answer, when it comes to political financing, we have some of the most strict rules across the country, and this government, this party, will always follow the rules. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, instead of encouraging job creation, the Conservatives have chosen to use the budget to attack charities. EOS BOS Their goal is clear: muzzle those who do not share their opinion. EOS BOS It was under this government that Montreal's Mafia boss got a $400,000 cheque from the Canada Revenue Agency while he was in prison. EOS BOS That is Conservative incompetence at its best. EOS BOS Will they let charities do their work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the only issue is whether these organizations are respecting the law. EOS BOS As a former president of the West Coast Environmental Law association, the member for Victoria knows that the rules regarding charities and political activities are long-standing. EOS BOS The rules have to be respected. EOS BOS CRA audits occur at arm's length, free of political interference. EOS BOS The CRA is doing its job. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first opponents of the Enbridge northern gateway pipeline, like me, were called radicals. EOS BOS Now we are called terrorists. EOS BOS The fact is, billions of dollars in tax revenues are being lost each year to tax havens, but instead of giving the CRA the resources it needs to fight tax cheats, the government is too busy trying to intimidate people who do not agree with them. EOS BOS Why is the minister going after charities and letting tax cheats off the hook? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I repeat, the only issue here is whether these organizations are respecting the law. EOS BOS The laws on political activity for charities have been very long-standing, as the member for Victoria, as an environmental lawyer, knows. EOS BOS The economic action plan gave increased tools to us to look at enforcing those rules. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing. EOS BOS We have improved transparency by requiring more detail on political activity from charities. EOS BOS The CRA, I repeat, is doing its job. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are used to the Liberals breaking election promises, but now it looks like they are misleading Canadians as well. EOS BOS The member for Winnipeg Centre sent a mail-out to his riding saying the Liberals had restored lifelong pensions for veterans. EOS BOS That is just not true. EOS BOS Why would he say that? EOS BOS Would the Minister of Veteran Affairs correct the record and admit that the Liberals have not restored veterans benefits in terms of lifelong pensions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave us a strong mandate to repair the relationship with veterans, with one of the focuses being on financial security for veterans, especially for ill and injured veterans. EOS BOS That is what we are working on. EOS BOS That work will include the development of a lifelong pension. EOS BOS Veterans told us to get it right, and that is what we are doing. EOS BOS We are making progress on that mandate, and we will be delivering in short order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the commissioner's report points out that the Liberals' objective of having 4.4% of francophone immigrants settle outside Quebec by 2008 was pushed back to 2023 by the Conservatives. EOS BOS The Conservatives have shut down regional offices, abolished the destination Canada and the francophone significant benefit programs, and have reallocated $120 million to purposes other than francophone immigration. EOS BOS In short, they have dismantled the francophone immigration promotion programs. EOS BOS To fix this mess, the minister promised that he would fix the express entry system. EOS BOS When will he do so? EOS BOS Will he keep a promise for once? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, we have been very clear about our goal of 4% for francophone immigration outside of Quebec. EOS BOS Our government has a road map to get there. EOS BOS We are already seeing results from express entry. EOS BOS We have taken note of the commissioner's other recommendations. EOS BOS The road map for linguistic duality that our government brought in in 2008 was renewed again for five years in 2013 and provides for over $1.1 billion to promote official languages in minority communities. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the Liberals say one thing when they stand up to ask questions, but they vote differently when programs like that come to a vote. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today is April 1, but with mounting job losses and deepening financial woes across the country, Canadians are not laughing. EOS BOS The government has mismanaged the economy, and now Canadians are paying the price for Conservative incompetence. EOS BOS Tens of thousands of retail sector jobs have either vanished or are evaporating, such as those at Future Shop, Target, Sony, Zellers, and Jacob, and I direct these to the minister in case he missed all of that. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives finally admit that their fiscal plan is more like an April Fool's joke than an economic strategy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the only joke is when the Liberal leader says that budgets balance themselves, but Canadians who have to balance their family budget are not laughing at the Liberal plan for higher taxes. EOS BOS The Liberals would raise taxes on middle-class families by cancelling income splitting for both parents and seniors. EOS BOS They voted against the universal child care benefit, which would put $2,000 per preschooler in the pockets of 100% of families with small kids. EOS BOS We are delivering benefits directly to families. EOS BOS The Liberals would take them away. EOS BOS That will kill jobs and hurt our economy. EOS BOS We will not let them do any of that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment put on her rose-coloured glasses when she spoke about sustainable development. EOS BOS When we remove those glasses, here is what we see: the Conservatives are not going to meet their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental assessments are going to disappear while oil pours out of pipelines. EOS BOS What is more, the Conservatives are firing our scientists. EOS BOS Who will defend this record? EOS BOS Is that why the Conservatives want to sabotage the Rio negotiations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us look at a highlight reel of the NDP year-end review when it comes to the environment. EOS BOS It voted against clean tech funding. EOS BOS It voted against climate change adaptation funding. EOS BOS It voted against increased participant funding for environmental assessment. EOS BOS It voted against laws that would increase monetary penalties for those who break the rules on environmental assessment. EOS BOS Our most recent greenhouse gas inventory showed that greenhouse gas emission growth in Canada stabilized while our economy continued to grow. EOS BOS When will my colleague opposite recognize that it is possible to grow the economy while maintaining environmental stewardship? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we can grow the economy with things like a green infrastructure fund. EOS BOS Today we actually learned from Global News that 80% of the green infrastructure fund has not been spent, showing a total lack of commitment to green infrastructure projects by the government. EOS BOS But wait, there is more. EOS BOS In fact, the money that has been spent is going to projects like running government offices and pipelines, not exactly top-of-mind environmental priorities. EOS BOS My question for the parliamentary secretary is: when will they quit with the greenwashing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I believe if we checked the record over the last few years for any sort of green infrastructure funding or anything that would support the environment, we would see that the NDP voted against it. EOS BOS By contrast, we are making tangible investment in green infrastructure, in research and development, to promote environmentally sustainable technologies and help get them to market. EOS BOS Moreover, we are working with industry, with stakeholder groups. EOS BOS We are consulting with them to figure out how we can implement programs to see real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and water quality improvement. EOS BOS In fact, the World Health Organization noted that we have the third-best air quality in the world. EOS BOS We are getting the job done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last Friday I met Maurice Martin, a fisherman from Aldouane, in my riding of Beauséjour. EOS BOS Mr. Martin has been on a hunger strike for 12 days to oppose the unfair changes made under the Conservatives' EI reform. EOS BOS He is doing what the Conservatives refuse to do: he is proudly standing up for—Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Beauséjour. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he is doing what the Conservatives will not do: he is standing up for seasonal workers. EOS BOS Here is what Mr. Martin wants to ask the Prime Minister: why is the government punishing people who work very hard? EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives want to kill communities in Kent County and elsewhere in Canada with their EI reform? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, employment insurance provides financial support to people who have lost their job while they look for a new one. EOS BOS If there is no work available in their area of expertise in their region, employment insurance will continue to be there for them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am always encouraged when there is some lucidity on the front benches of the Conservatives. “This NDP government”—it sounds so good. EOS BOS We can hardly wait. EOS BOS [Translation]The Conservatives' electoral “deform” bill will be bad for voter participation. EOS BOS Two out of three young people—65%—between the ages of 18 and 25 did not bother to vote last time around. EOS BOS Most of those who did vote used their voter information card. EOS BOS That will be illegal next time. EOS BOS How can criminalizing a practice that helps people vote be good for democracy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, one in six of those cards contains an error, so they are not a secure piece of identification. EOS BOS However, there are 39 other ways for people to identify themselves, including student cards, which is something students have, obviously. EOS BOS We will also require Elections Canada to do a better job of informing people, especially students, about acceptable pieces of identification. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, even he cannot prevent us from celebrating Alexandre Bilodeau's gold and Mikaël Kingsbury's silver. EOS BOS [English]The Conservatives' unfair election act would put a gag order on the Chief Electoral Officer. EOS BOS That includes scrapping the student vote program, which has engaged 500,000 Canadian young people and promotes the importance of voting. EOS BOS When we know that 65% of young people did not bother to vote last time around, we know how important this is. EOS BOS Since when is teaching kids about the importance of voting a partisan issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, half of young people were not even aware that they could vote before election day. EOS BOS If they were working or studying on the day the vote was held, they did not have a chance to cast a ballot. EOS BOS The fair elections act would require Elections Canada to better inform young people of all of the voting opportunities available to them. EOS BOS Furthermore, a quarter of non-voting youth said they were not aware of where, when, or how to cast a ballot, and those were some of the reasons that they did not vote. EOS BOS The fair elections act would ensure they have all that information so that they can participate in democracy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the last election it was the Chief Electoral Officer who warned Canadians about voter suppression through the Conservatives' voter-suppression robocalls. EOS BOS The Federal Court has concluded that the Conservative database was in fact the source of those calls. EOS BOS However, under the Conservatives' new gag order, the CEO would not be allowed to talk to Canadians about anything except when, where, and how to vote. EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives want to stop Elections Canada from telling? EOS BOS Why do they want to stop Canadians from learning about their voter fraud? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition could not be further from the truth. EOS BOS In fact, the fair elections act would change section 18 of the Canada Elections Act to shift the advertising function of Elections Canada towards the basics of voting: where, when, and what ID to bring. EOS BOS In other sections in the existing Canada Elections Act, sections 533, 534, 535, and others, not only is the CEO allowed to speak, but he is required to speak, through reports to Parliament and testimony before a parliamentary committee, which automatically become public. EOS BOS That would remain the case with the fair elections act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, world-leading rhetoric, perhaps. EOS BOS Speaking of Stephen Harper's targets, the Minister of Health set the end of the year as a deadline to finalize a new health accord, but all she has done so far is adopt Harper's cuts to provincial funding. EOS BOS According to Newfoundland's health minister, the talks on the health accord have “gone silent”. EOS BOS All provinces have confirmed that the Liberals' cuts to the health escalator will hurt Canada's health care services. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister honour his election promise to negotiate fairly, stop unilaterally dictating funding, and negotiate a health care accord that improve services for all Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. EOS BOS There will be no cuts to health care. EOS BOS Canadians are proud of our publicly funded universal health care system. EOS BOS It ensures that no Canadian has to make a choice between economic well-being and their health. EOS BOS The Minister of Health met with her provincial and territorial counterparts in October. EOS BOS Next year, the Canada health transfer will grow by more than a billion dollars, to over $37 billion. EOS BOS We will continue to work with them on how we can create a health care system that meets the needs of Canadians for years to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking on the deadline for a new health care agreement, but we still have no news. EOS BOS The provinces agree that the government's choice to maintain transfer payment cuts will hurt our health care system. EOS BOS Philippe Couillard made it clear that Quebec would not agree to any conditions because the federal government has no right to impose conditions on the provinces for health care. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister keep his promise and negotiate with the provinces in good faith, or will he just do whatever he wants? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to a collaborative approach to health care. EOS BOS Next year, the Canada health transfer will grow by over a billion dollars, to over $37 billion. EOS BOS The Minister of Health met with her provincial and territorial counterparts in October. EOS BOS We will continue to work with them on creating a health care system that Canadians can be proud of. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a clear priority for the FCM meeting this week is the challenge faced by Canadian municipalities in mitigating climate impact infrastructure. EOS BOS Just this week the commissioner for the environment reprimanded the government for failing to ensure that federal infrastructure programs directed at mitigating environmental and climate impacts to cities actually deliver results. EOS BOS Equally troubling, she raised concerns with the dwindling gas tax revenues, a significant source of municipal roads, housing, and infrastructure. EOS BOS What concrete measures is the government taking to ensure our cities are sustainable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for a number of years the national disaster mitigation program and the mitigation aspects of the disaster financial assistance arrangements have not been fully utilized by previous governments. EOS BOS That is why in our campaign platform the Prime Minister included the specific undertaking that we would examine those very programs and determine how to improve the uptake. EOS BOS In addition to that, we have added $20 billion in green infrastructure funding that can assist directly with those mitigation measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are incapable of making funding available for infrastructure projects in Quebec. EOS BOS The Quebec minister responsible for Canadian relations is complaining that federal officials are constantly imposing new conditions for project approval, to the point where the Government of Quebec does not think it will get any federal funding before 2017. EOS BOS This is so problematic that the first ministers now must get involved. EOS BOS Why is it taking so long for funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in Quebec to be approved? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are working closely with our partners in Quebec to fund the infrastructure projects that Quebeckers need. EOS BOS Since we became government, we have already made six announcements with Quebec worth over $36 million, and none of that money would have gone anywhere under the previous government, although it is moving quickly under our leadership. EOS BOS Better yet, we have a few more announcements to make with Quebec over the next few weeks. EOS BOS We are working closely with our counterpart, the finance minister, Carlos Leitão, on new funding, and we hope to finalize an agreement very soon. EOS BOS Consultation, partnership, and action are the way to get things done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Employment and Social Development boasted that the new Social Security Tribunal has reduced EI appeals by 90%. EOS BOS However, he has not told unemployed Canadians that their actual chance of winning an appeal has been greatly reduced. EOS BOS Before in the tribunal, Canadians appealing had the decision overturned over 50% of the time. EOS BOS The success rate has now dropped to 38% under the new system. EOS BOS Could the minister explain to affected Canadians why such a drastic drop in the success of appeals? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when the Social Security Tribunal was created, my department, to its great credit, started a new internal process of reconsideration of refused EI applications, allowing for those reconsiderations to happen in a matter of weeks rather than the months it took for the previous Board of Referees to render a judgment. EOS BOS I have been informed by my senior officials that about 50% of the reconsiderations end up overturning the initial refusal after more information is obtained. EOS BOS Therefore, I do not think the member's information is correct. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning, even the Government of Quebec asked the Minister of Transport to settle down with his unacceptable Bill C-10.This minister, who has been bragging for weeks about the agreement between Quebec and Bombardier and the creation of centres of excellence, is about to sabotage that agreement and cause more job losses in the riding of his own colleague from Saint-Laurent. EOS BOS Does the minister realize that his closure motion is not only awful but also dangerous for the future of Quebec's aerospace industry? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for the third time, I repeat that we decided to move a time allocation motion precisely because the NDP wanted to kill this bill last Friday. EOS BOS As my colleague knows, in the federal Parliament bills go through several stages, including review in committee. EOS BOS Several witnesses will have the opportunity to speak to this bill. EOS BOS There will also be report stage and third reading. EOS BOS Then, we will start all over again in the Senate. EOS BOS People still have plenty of time to have their say on this bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is unethical closure for the purpose of destabilizing the aerospace industry with an unethical bill. EOS BOS The Government of Quebec never dropped its lawsuits against Air Canada. EOS BOS It merely suspended them to maintain its bargaining power so it could save Bombardier, which this government seems to have left to its own devices. EOS BOS Why does the federal government want to take away Quebec's bargaining power in the aerospace sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, we decided to amend the Air Canada Public Participation Act precisely because the governments of Quebec and Manitoba decided to drop their lawsuits against Air Canada. EOS BOS That is why we decided to clarify the legislation. EOS BOS I would remind my colleague that Air Canada is required to keep aircraft maintenance jobs in Ontario, Manitoba, and Quebec. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Quebec Court of Appeal has come to the same conclusion as the Bloc Québécois, namely that Ottawa's plan for a securities regulator is unconstitutional. EOS BOS At this point we are no longer talking about interference so much as invasion. EOS BOS Ottawa is attacking Quebec's jurisdictions and threatening the sovereignty of the National Assembly. EOS BOS It is serious. EOS BOS Ottawa is also dismantling Montreal's entire economic system and economic ecosystem. EOS BOS Where did the 40 Liberal members from Quebec go and how do they justify allowing their party to attack the authority of the National Assembly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. EOS BOS Our government received the ruling from the Quebec Court of Appeal and we are going over it carefully. EOS BOS The Supreme Court has already said that the federal government had a role to play in managing the systemic risks on capital markets. EOS BOS We are fulfilling that responsibility in a collaborative spirit that is respectful of provincial and territorial jurisdictions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the chair of the procedure and House affairs committee. EOS BOS My understanding is that today at committee the NDP denied consent for the report concerning the committee. EOS BOS Can the chair of the procedure and House affairs committee explain his understanding as to why consent was denied? EOS </s> BOS I am afraid that question would be out of order. EOS BOS Questions for committee chairs are very limited to certain parameters, and I do not know that this question falls within them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Blacklock's reports that it has unearthed secret plans by Canada Post to find ways to diversify its operations through such things as financial services, a far cry from their current plan to raise prices and make devastating cuts to services. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Transport tell us if these diversification plans were referred to cabinet, and if so, were they simply dismissed by the Conservatives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that Canadians are choosing more and more not to send mail by the traditional methods, because we are in a digital era and email, of course, is the way in which people are doing business today. EOS BOS Canada Post has come up a plan to combat what they are facing in terms of the erosion of letter mail, and has put its five-point plan forward. EOS BOS We support it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have a report detailing options that could ensure Canada Post's survival. EOS BOS However, that report was never made public. EOS BOS What is worse, the crown corporation and its 23 executives—who are paid $10 million—have even denied ever having done this research. EOS BOS In addition, 701 of the 811 pages of the report have been redacted, hidden, blacked out. EOS BOS Does the minister not think that all that research should be made public so that we can assess every option together in order to avoid cutting 8,000 jobs and eliminating home delivery? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since 1981 Canada Post has had a mandate to operate on a self-sustaining basis. EOS BOS It has recognized in the past number of years, and indeed going into the future, that it will not have enough business to remain self-sufficient. EOS BOS As a result, it has developed a five-point plan. EOS BOS Those are the points Canada Post will be implementing, and we do support these in government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, following the Volkswagen diesel engine scandal, the U.S. government had Volkswagen agree, as part of the settlement, to inject $2 billion into charging stations for electric vehicles. EOS BOS In Canada, we are still waiting for the results of Environment and Climate Change Canada's investigation. EOS BOS My question is very simple. EOS BOS Can the minister undertake to have Volkswagen invest some money in Canada's networks of charging stations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS Environment and Climate Change Canada's investigation of Volkswagen is ongoing, and I cannot comment further. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last Sunday, Ecuador was hit by the worst earthquake in 40 years. EOS BOS This devastating earthquake claimed hundreds of victims, including four Canadians. EOS BOS Furthermore, tens of thousands of disaster victims find themselves in an extremely precarious humanitarian situation. EOS BOS Can the Minister of National Defence inform the House of what could be made available to Ecuadorians to help them deal with this immense catastrophe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Ville-Marie— EOS BOS Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Soeurs for sharing his deep concern along with, I am assuming, everyone else in the House on Equador's disaster. EOS BOS The Government of Canada immediately responded with $1.1 million in emergency relief assistance. EOS BOS We now have a team down in Equador doing an assessment as to what further help can be given in order to make recommendations to the government, including the possible deployment of the DART. EOS BOS I thank the hon. EOS BOS member for his concern and indeed the concern of all members in the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on average, the 6,400 members of the Quebec convenience stores association pay $36,000 each in credit card transaction fees every year. EOS BOS Large retailers like Costco and Walmart no longer want to do business with Visa, whose transaction fees are too high. EOS BOS However, smaller retailers cannot afford to turn their backs on their customers. EOS BOS When will the minister lower the cap on the credit card transaction fees being charged to merchants, as was done in 28 European countries, where fees are as low as 0.5%? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my hon. colleague for his important question. EOS BOS As my colleague is well aware, Canada's credit card market is complex. EOS BOS Over the next few months, we plan to observe the results of the voluntary agreement that has been introduced. EOS BOS We are already seeing that the voluntary agreement with merchants in this country that accept credit card payments has reduced fees by 10%. EOS BOS We are monitoring the situation very closely. EOS BOS I want to assure the House that Canadian consumers are our top priority. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is now 1 month and 27 days since Mike Duffy offered to pay back the taxpayer. EOS BOS However, last night we saw Prince Edward Island's most famous summer tourist once again ducking and weaving from accountability. EOS BOS He gets asked a simple question by a reporter, “ EOS BOS Have you paid back the money?” and he runs away. EOS BOS How long will the government allow this ripoff of the taxpayer? EOS BOS What will it do to get our money back? EOS BOS Will it at least send a collection agency to the red chamber down the hall? EOS BOS What about it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said, we want to see that the expenses incurred by senators are appropriate and that all the rules are followed. EOS BOS That is what the Senate review has been seeking to do. EOS BOS The more important question is we also want to see fundamental change to the Senate. EOS BOS This week, taking his seat is one more elected senator actually chosen by the voters of his province, Scott Tannas. EOS BOS We are pleased to see he is there. EOS BOS What Canadians want to know is why is the NDP is standing in the way of having real democracy and having all senators selected by the people of Canada? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians want to know why the Conservatives promised reform and gave us Patrick Brazeau. EOS BOS The Conservatives promised to clean up the Senate. EOS BOS Instead they are defending their entitlements in the worst political spending scandal in memory. EOS BOS They refuse to tell us how many are being investigated. EOS BOS They refuse to tell us how much money is being paid back and why the senators are allowed to police themselves when they pay out their expenses based on a pinkie swear. EOS BOS That is not accountability. EOS BOS Will the government demand that its Conservative-dominated Senate hand over the audits and come clean with Canadians so we know how much taxpayers are being ripped off? EOS BOS That is accountability. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear throughout that we want to see respect for Canadians' tax dollars. EOS BOS Canadians work too hard to have their tax dollars taken by excessive and irresponsible government spending. EOS BOS We want to see the Senate apply the rules. EOS BOS Canadians do not want to see the tax-and-spend approach by the NDP.What Canadians do want is a chance for them to actually be treated with respect by political parties. EOS BOS They want to see an opposition NDP, instead of saying Canadians do not have the maturity to select their own representatives in the House, actually support real democracy and support our legislation to give Canadians a say in who actually represents them in the Senate. EOS BOS That is what Canadians want to see. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the process the government used to appoint Justice Nadon was a disaster. EOS BOS In anticipation of Justice LeBel's imminent retirement this fall, can the minister tell us what lessons the government has learned and what process will be used to replace Justice LeBel so that Quebec does not have to go another year without its full contingent of judges on the Supreme Court? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously, we took the time to get outside expert legal advice, including advice from former Supreme Court justices. EOS BOS That advice pointed clearly to the fact that Mr. Justice Nadon was eligible. EOS BOS We proceeded on that advice. EOS BOS Subsequent to that, of course, the Supreme Court has made a ruling. EOS BOS We will respect the spirit and the letter of that ruling. EOS BOS As I indicated yesterday, I have now had the opportunity to not only speak on the phone with but meet personally with the new Quebec justice minister, Mme. EOS BOS Vallée. EOS BOS We have working collaboratively to come forward with what we think will be a very good choice for the next Supreme Court justice. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the citizenship bill introduced by the Conservatives would concentrate more power in the hands of the minister. EOS BOS These include important powers, such as the power to grant and revoke citizenship. EOS BOS Giving the minister these powers opens the door to arbitrary, non-transparent and partisan decision-making. EOS BOS The Conservatives are saying that the Chief Electoral Officer should not wear a team jersey. EOS BOS Why, then, are the Conservatives prepared to give the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration the power to be both judge and jury? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, under our new citizenship bill, any revocation of citizenship would be subject to the highest standards and criteria. EOS BOS The real question we are asking ourselves on this side of the House is this: would the NDP agree that some people have abused the citizenship program, that there have been some cases of fraud in relation to residency in Canada and that the RCMP is currently investigating 3,000 cases linked to this kind of fraud? EOS BOS Would the NDP agree that this problem exists and that we need a solution? EOS BOS So far, we have received no response to that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we do not need a lecture on citizenship from a government that welcomed with open arms a convicted felon by the name of Conrad Black. EOS BOS This is the same government that nearly doubled processing time for citizenship applications, and family reunification delays get longer and longer. EOS BOS Now it wants to concentrate more power in the hands of the minister, giving unilateral power over citizenship. EOS BOS Will the minister agree to actually bring real reform to Canada's citizenship laws, not just more power for himself? EOS BOS Will he work with us to fix Canada's citizenship laws? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's citizenship programs have not been reformed in a thoroughgoing way since 1977, since the failed Liberal project that put citizenship on an unreliable foundation was brought into being. EOS BOS We are going to work to bring processing times down below one year in only 18 months and we are going to work to deal with the issues of terrorists, of fraud, of people who join terrorist groups abroad and have dual nationality. EOS BOS We do not think those people deserve Canadian citizenship, and most Canadians agree with us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the past, the Conservatives refused to stand up and defend our jobs. EOS BOS Just look at Electrolux, Caterpillar, Xstrata, Falconbridge or U.S. Steel Canada. EOS BOS If the past is any indication, then there is cause for concern over the sale of Nexen to the Communist Chinese government. EOS BOS If the government thinks that handing over control of our natural resources to a Chinese state-owned corporation is such a good idea, then why do so behind closed doors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP wants to block practically every form of foreign investment, and the Liberals want to rubber-stamp every investment. EOS BOS Fortunately, Canadians can count on a responsible government that acts in their best interests. EOS BOS Our government has always scrutinized every proposed foreign investment in this country, and it will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, support among Conservatives is crumbling on Nexen. EOS BOS In today's paper it is said:[W]e should resist state ownership...of agencies of foreign governments.... [The] decision must ultimately be capable of carrying the judgment of a majority of Canadians.... EOS BOS More than 60 per cent of Canadians currently oppose what they know of the deal. EOS BOS Who was that? EOS BOS It was the Prime Minister's own mentor, former Reform leader Preston Manning. EOS BOS He says that the NDP and Canadians are right on Nexen. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives ignoring concerns about this sellout of Alberta's natural resources? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to foreign investment, we know that at the extreme end of the spectrum, the NDP will block everything. EOS BOS The NDP will block every proposed transaction in this country. EOS BOS On the other side, there are the Liberals who rubber-stamp every single form of investment in this country. EOS BOS Fortunately, Canadians can count on their responsible government, which is always acting in their best interests. EOS BOS That being said, we always scrutinize the transactions closely and will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today we learned that the Canada Border Services Agency is very concerned that violent drug cartels will extend their reach into Canada now that the visa requirement for Mexicans has been lifted. EOS BOS CBSA believes that Mexican drug cartels will send their operatives over the border with ease and recruit airport and marine employees with ties to Mexican crime rings. EOS BOS With drug overdoses in the news every day, can the minister tell us how he plans to fix this mess made by the Liberals' political decision to lift Mexican visas? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, CBSA has worked very closely with the immigration and citizenship department to ensure that we have a strong system in place to facilitate appropriate, legitimate travel between Canada and Mexico and at the same time to ensure the safety and security of Canadians. EOS BOS Canadians can be absolutely assured that every reasonable step has been taken to make sure that this arrangement works successfully both ways. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not what they are saying in an internal report. EOS BOS The CBSA sees Mexican drug cartels picking up the baton from China on fentanyl shipments into Canada. EOS BOS The Liberals' ill-advised decision to lift Mexican visas on a whim is now coming home to roost, and we will have tragic consequences. EOS BOS How can the minister assure Canadians that murderous Mexican drug cartels will not have easy access into Canada to supply our streets with more deadly drugs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, contrary to that kind of fearmongering, in fact what that memo shows is that CBSA has done its homework. EOS BOS It has worked assiduously with all its partners in Canada and in Mexico to make sure that the border arrangement works effectively and that Canadians are indeed safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, ISIL continues to terrorize the people of Iraq and Syria, particularly those who reject ISIL's twisted interpretation of Islam. EOS BOS Religious minorities remain at risk, such as Christians, Yazidis, Shia, and the Syrians. EOS BOS In July, ISIL destroyed Jonah's tomb, a venerated site of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. EOS BOS Earlier this week, we learned that ISIL had struck again, this time destroying an Armenian church in Syria and a memorial to the Armenian genocide. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs  please comment on this developing situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government deplores ISIL's destruction of the Armenian Holy Martyrs church, in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as well as the Museum of the Holy Martyrs. EOS BOS This is yet another example of ISIL's contempt for religious freedom and human dignity. EOS BOS ISIL attacks are indiscriminate, targeting Christians, Shia, Yazidis, Sunni Muslims, and their places of worship. EOS BOS Canada continues to condemn this terrorist group, which has a distorted and warped message of Islam and has murdered thousands of innocents. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the First Nations Financial Transparency Act gave band members for the first time ever access to critical information such as salaries and expenses of their leaders and audited financial statements. EOS BOS On Friday, the minister admitted to Canadians that “no formal consultations” were held before gutting the act. EOS BOS Does the minister not believe that band members should have input into a decision that affects them so directly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, the department was not in charge at that time. EOS BOS As the opposition critic, we consulted broadly through that time. EOS BOS We know exactly what first nations feel about transparency. EOS BOS Accountability is very important to everyone. EOS BOS We have to do it their way, not the way the Conservatives did it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is time to come clean on the Wright-Duffy affair. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's mouthpiece claims he was not aware of the RCMP investigating “anyone currently in PMO”, but, of course, the PMO staff involved in this scandal have been promoted. EOS BOS The Minister of Natural Resources's new chief of staff, Chris Woodcock, allegedly wrote the cover-up script for Mike Duffy. EOS BOS Can the government confirm whether Mr. Woodcock has been contacted by the RCMP? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said from the beginning, we will continue to co-operate with authorities on this matter. EOS BOS Mr. Wright has been very clear who he brought into his confidence on this matter. EOS BOS At the same time, we are very proud of those Conservative senators who supported this motion yesterday. EOS BOS Of course, Liberal senators did exactly what we expected them to do: fought for the status quo in the Senate. EOS BOS As the Prime Minister just said, the Liberals will always fight for their entitlements, but they will never fight for taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I regret that I did not get an answer to my question, so let us try again. EOS BOS We are talking here about the guy who allegedly instructed Duffy to lie, something this Parliamentary Secretary appears to condone. EOS BOS Has Mr. Woodcock had contact with the RCMP in any way? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will speak much slower so that he can understand me. EOS BOS We will continue to work with the authorities on this matter. EOS BOS Mr. Wright was very clear about who he brought into his confidence on this. EOS BOS If only the Liberals had actually supported taxpayers and Conservative senators, and actually voted to suspend these three senators. EOS BOS I am very proud of the fact that Conservatives on this side of the House and in the Senate will always stand up for taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, instructing someone to lie to cover up the Wright-Duffy agreement could constitute a criminal offence. EOS BOS Chris Woodcock was the Prime Minister's adviser, his “ EOS BOS Mr. Clean”. EOS BOS He was promoted and is now chief of staff to a minister. EOS BOS Has Mr. Woodcock been contacted by the RCMP or did he provide the RCMP with documents and emails on his own initiative? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will continue to work with the authorities in this matter. EOS BOS As I have said on a number of occasions, Canadians have said loud and clear that they want accountability in the Senate. EOS BOS Yesterday, unfortunately, Liberal senators once again let them down. EOS BOS The Liberal senators are fighting very hard for the status quo. EOS BOS Conservative senators in the Senate did Canadians proud yesterday by suspending these three senators without pay, standing up for taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand a Canadian delegation met in recent days with the Reverend Hyeon Soo Lim, who remains in prison, forced to a life sentence of hard labour in North Korea. EOS BOS That is just outrageous. EOS BOS Reports indicate that his condition is deteriorating and that time is growing short for him. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS What are the Liberals doing to bring Reverend Lim home to his family and to his congregation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, like Mr. Lim's family and friends, the Government of Canada is concerned about his rights and his well-being. EOS BOS We continue to work for his release. EOS BOS I have met in the past with members of his family and members of the community. EOS BOS We continue to be engaged on this file. EOS BOS Our officials are providing consular services to him and his family, and we will not stop until Mr. Lim is released. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to bring to your attention a grave and disturbing matter that occurred yesterday while riding the House of Commons bus. EOS BOS I stand with a very heavy heart for this point of order because it was exactly for that reason I went into politics, to be a voice for the most vulnerable and fight for the rights of women, especially immigrant women, and bring their voice to Ottawa to fight against racism, agism, and sexism. EOS BOS Now I will state the facts. EOS BOS I was sitting on an outside seat when the member for Spadina—Fort York entered the bus. EOS BOS The member stopped and hovered over me. EOS BOS He began to wave his hand in my face, chastised and intimidated me for something I said in the House earlier in the day. EOS BOS Yesterday, during question period, the Prime Minister was giving one of his non-answers to a question about the government transferring up to half a billion dollars into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, while at the same time the PBO reported the government was behind on infrastructure spending within Canada. EOS BOS With great emotion and pride, I said “ EOS BOS Canada is our home”. EOS BOS For some reason, the member took issue with my statement and began to intimidate me for raising it, making suggestions to alternative statements I could have made. EOS BOS I did not have time to give you the proper notice of a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker, but I reserve the right to do so. EOS BOS I do so for the following reasons. EOS BOS Responding to threats was among the first matters of parliamentary privilege dealt with in Canada. EOS BOS Page 198 of the second edition of Joseph Maginot's Parliamentary Privilege in Canada tells us of an incident in 1758 where the Nova Scotia House of Assembly proceeded against someone who made threats against a member. EOS BOS In a ruling on September 19, 1973, Mr. Speaker Lamoureux, at page 6709 of the Debates, stated that he had:
              
                
                  no hesitation in reaffirming the principle that parliamentary privilege includes the right of a member to discharge his responsibilities as a member of the House free from threats and attempts at intimidation. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker Bosley, on May 16, 1986, at page 13362 of Debates, ruled that the threat or attempt to intimidate could not be hypothetical, but that it must be real or have occurred. EOS BOS I have a whole bus of passengers who witnessed this whole incident. EOS BOS On March 24, 1994, at page 2705 of Debates, Mr. Speaker Parent said:
              
                
                   Threats of blackmail or intimidation of a member of Parliament should never be taken lightly. EOS BOS When such occurs, the very essence of free speech is undermined. EOS BOS Without the guarantee of freedom of speech, no member of Parliament can do his duty as expected. EOS BOS This attempt to intimidate me was directly linked to what I said in the House earlier in the day, and that, Mr. Speaker, should be grounds enough to warrant a favourable ruling for a question of privilege. EOS BOS Hiding behind a prime minister who claims to be a feminist does not give the member the right to intimidate another member of the same House of another party. EOS BOS Female members of all three parties were on the bus. EOS BOS They witnessed everything he did and how he intimidated me. EOS BOS Therefore, I reserve the right for a question of privilege with proper notice. EOS </s> BOS I want to thank the hon. EOS BOS member for her intervention. EOS BOS We will look into it, dig a little deeper, and get back to the House if we deem it necessary. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, children at St. Anne's Residential School suffered nightmarish levels of abuse, torture, and child rape, yet the office of the Attorney General suppressed thousands of pages of police evidence that identified those perpetrators and in doing so, they had cases thrown out and undermined the hearings. EOS BOS Now that the justice department has been forced to turn over those documents, they claim it is inadmissible unless a survivor finds a witness to verify these atrocities. EOS BOS To the Prime Minister, enough. EOS BOS The survivors of St. Anne's deserve better. EOS BOS Will he instruct his government to end this obstruction of justice against the survivors of St. Anne's, once and for all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the ills done to indigenous people over decades and centuries of colonialism in this country are shameful and are something that we need to learn from and move forward on. EOS BOS That includes respecting the rights of indigenous people now in all their different aspects. EOS BOS That is why we are working with survivors, working with communities to ensure that we can move forward in a way that is fully respectful of all their rights as we get to the bottom of this, understand their history, and make reparations in the right way moving forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he is quite right, for once. EOS BOS We wanted to kill his bill, and that is what the Quebec government is calling for. EOS BOS [English]On Monday, the Liberals blamed the Conservatives for letting the Catholic Church off the hook for millions of dollars in the restitution of residential schools, but it turns out that the minister had seven days of briefings before she let the church off the hook. EOS BOS Is the minister suggesting that it is not her fault, that she did not read her briefing books? EOS BOS Is she still going to blame the Conservatives, or is she going to stand in the House and explain why the Liberals let the church off the hook? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the headline of the story was wrong, and has subsequently been corrected. EOS BOS Let me be clear. EOS BOS The agreement of release was signed October 30, five days before the new government took office. EOS BOS The previous government initiated negotiations last summer and the previous government agreed to withdraw the protective notice of appeal. EOS BOS The government continues to work with the Catholic entities to urge them to fulfill their financial commitments to their reconciliation with aboriginal people in our country. EOS BOS This is not something the Government of Canada can do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, building safer communities should be a priority for any government, but in yet another example of Conservative mismanagement, Conservatives are cutting the 45-year-old program that allows first nations to police their own communities in partnership with the RCMP. EOS BOS This terminates a vital front-line service for many remote reserves where the nearest RCMP detachment is often several communities away. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS Will the government reverse this ill-advised and dangerous decision to terminate the first nations constable program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that this government is committed to providing our first nations with very professional, first-quality service to communities. EOS BOS That is why we have renewed our agreement for five years. EOS BOS All the money that was oriented to other programs that were not effective in meeting their targets will go into first nations first-quality service policing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives refuse to hold an inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women and are also cutting the budgets for aboriginal policing. EOS BOS Things are not going to improve. EOS BOS Essential services that ensure the safety of often remote aboriginal communities will suffer because of the Conservatives' electoral promises. EOS BOS These people are not just responsible for safety in these communities—they are often the first responders as well. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives justify cuts that affect the safety of first nations communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. EOS BOS All amounts allocated to first nations' policing will be used to provide professional services. EOS BOS We treat first nations like equals, just like all Canadians. EOS BOS That is why our government has ensured that women's rights in aboriginal communities are recognized just like the rights of all other women. EOS BOS Unfortunately, we did not have the NDP's support to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government is committed to keeping illicit drugs off the streets and getting help for those who are addicted. EOS BOS Recently we learned about a troubling new development in Vancouver. EOS BOS The newest hot seller in vending machines is not candy; it is crack pipes for a quarter. EOS BOS There have been more than 22,000 crack pipes sold since the launch of this misguided initiative. EOS BOS My constituents believe police should be enforcing the law and taking drug accessories off the streets. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety tell the House what the government's position is on these so-called crack pipe vending machines? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our position is crystal clear, and I thank the member for Mississauga— EOS BOS Streetsville for his concern for vulnerable people and caring for safer communities. EOS BOS Unlike the Liberals and the NDP, we do not believe that handing out heroin and needles to people who are suffering from addiction is a solution. EOS BOS We believe in helping them, in making them stop using dangerous drugs and keeping drugs off our streets. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night, watching from the Trois-Rivières marina, Captain Frigon witnessed a shipwreck and called the Quebec City search and rescue centre. EOS BOS Within a few minutes, four people were rescued by the Coast Guard. EOS BOS Tragically, two people are still missing. EOS BOS Does the minister not see that time, ultra-fast intervention, full knowledge of French and familiarity with the St. Lawrence saved four lives?Will he keep the Quebec City search and rescue centre open? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course we are saddened by any deaths and we are also very happy to hear that four lives were saved. EOS BOS The changes we are proposing would have no effect on the services being provided. EOS BOS We would provide the same bilingual service, the same rapid response as the Coast Guard has always done in the past. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is another mark on the Conservatives' record. EOS BOS Over six years, the Conservatives have developed a very detailed guide on what not to do with military procurement. EOS BOS They did not have a bidding process for the F-35s; they did not offer any guarantees of industrial spinoffs or jobs; and they hid $10 billion from the total of costs. EOS BOS The worst part of this whole fiasco is that no one has taken any responsibility. EOS BOS Are they simply irresponsible? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we take responsibility in terms of meeting all the recommendations that the Auditor General has outlined in his report. EOS BOS Importantly, no money has been spent on the acquisition of any aircraft. EOS BOS To replace our aging CF-18s, we have launched the National Fighter Procurement Secretariat. EOS BOS This arm's-length secretariat will be doing the due diligence very transparently and openly. EOS BOS We look forward to its conclusions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' record is rather impressive when it comes to failures. EOS BOS But Canadians are not fooled. EOS BOS They know full well that to fix all of the problems with the F-35s, particularly the ever-increasing costs, we need much more than the creation of a simple secretariat made up of the very people who were responsible for the fiasco. EOS BOS After making many mistakes, the Conservatives have lost control over this procurement process. EOS BOS Will we have to wait for a new Minister of National Defence before we get answers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, no money has been spent on the acquisition of any new fighter aircraft. EOS BOS In fact, to replace our aging CF-18s we have launched the National Fighter Procurement Secretariat. EOS BOS This arm's-length secretariat will ensure that the due diligence, oversight and transparency will be performed for this acquisition. EOS BOS Importantly, it also includes the advice of independent members, one being a former very well respect Canadian auditor general, Denis Desautels. EOS BOS We look forward to his support. EOS BOS In the interest of taxpayers, we will not move forward with a purchase of any new aircraft until we have received the conclusions of the secretariat. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have had over six years. EOS BOS The CF-18s need to be replaced, but they just cannot get the job done: “ EOS BOS It's the best plane in the world”. EOS BOS “No, it's just a developmental project”. “ EOS BOS The AG is right”. EOS BOS “No, the AG is wrong”. “ EOS BOS We haven't spent any money, except for the $700 million”. “ EOS BOS That minster is in charge”. EOS BOS “No, it's the other guy”. “ EOS BOS No, now it's this minister in charge”.Why have the Conservatives turned defence into an Abbott and Costello sketch? EOS BOS Who is on first? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can say who is not supporting the military and it is that member and his party. EOS BOS While our party has spent up to $1 billion annually to replace equipment, support programs, to make our forces better and ready to respond and to support the men and women in uniform, what we get is claptrap and insults. EOS BOS The member from Winnipeg referred to war toys. EOS BOS However, C-17s brought compassionate aid to Haiti. EOS BOS Those are not war toys. EOS BOS There has been a lot of work that has been done in Afghanistan to protect those men and women's lives who are doing so much for Canada. EOS BOS That is an insult to our soldiers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I thought that minister was on the bench. EOS BOS However, instead of turning this important project into a comedy of errors, the Conservatives could have just committed to an open and transparent competitive process. EOS BOS That would have guaranteed the best plane for the best price with the best benefits to our economy. EOS BOS Instead, we get more of this ducking and diving, with no answers to some very simple questions. EOS BOS When will the comedy team get the hook? EOS BOS When will the Conservatives get a new act together to replace the CF-18s? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, rather than respond to this comedy routine, I want to remind the member opposite and members of his party that this government believes strongly in investment for the Canadian Forces, and for the Canadian economy, giving them the protective equipment they need to do the important work at home and abroad. EOS BOS I am extremely proud of the work of the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS I am proud to be part of a government that has brought the Canadian Forces out of decade of darkness under the previous Liberal government to a decade of delivery under a caring, compassionate, Conservative government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the premiers of Quebec and the provinces will be discussing health transfers. EOS BOS We know what the Liberals’ position is. EOS BOS What they are doing is cutting transfers, just like the Conservatives decided to do, with the conditions demanded by the NDP, the worst of both worlds. EOS BOS Cutting transfers is an attack on patient services. EOS BOS Imposing conditions amounts to taking them hostage. EOS BOS With this meeting a few hours from now, will the Prime Minister finally admit that health is the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and restore funding with no strings attached? EOS BOS I would be thrilled with a simple yes to my question. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said previously in the House, there will be no cuts to health care. EOS BOS Our government is committed to a collaborative approach to health care. EOS BOS Next year, the Canada health transfer will grow by more than a billion dollars to over $37 billion. EOS BOS The Minister of Health met with her provincial and territorial counterparts in October. EOS BOS We will continue to work with them in creating a health care system that meets the needs of all Canadians, including in Quebec. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the NDP and the Liberals, our government has been clear. EOS BOS We are unequivocal in our support of the Canadian sealing industry, an industry that is vital to communities across Canada. EOS BOS We continue to stand up and support these important jobs. EOS BOS Could our regional minister from Newfoundland and Labrador please inform this House of any updates regarding our government's respect and support for sealers in Newfoundland and Labrador and the rest of Canada? EOS </s> BOS [Member spoke in Innu-aimun]Mr. EOS BOS Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. EOS BOS member for that question. EOS BOS Unlike the NDP and Liberals, I am proud to be part of this government that truly supports Canadian sealers and recognizes the importance of traditional industry, not only in Newfoundland and Labrador but across the entire country. EOS BOS That is why tomorrow I have the honour to announce a major contribution on behalf of the government to the Home EOS BOS From the Sea campaign to build a memorial to Canadian sealers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, either the minister does not understand the file, or he truly thinks that Canadians are stupid. EOS BOS I would like to talk about other cuts that will directly affect the people of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and the economy of my entire region. EOS BOS According to the Union of National Defence Employees, 144 civilian jobs at the Saint-Jean military base are being eliminated. EOS BOS The military base is an important economic driver in my region. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives attacking so many regions in Quebec with their budget cuts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are still investing in the military, including in its infrastructure across Canada. EOS BOS At the same time, we need to ensure our economy is balanced, while making important decisions that respect Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS For every decision that is made, we work with the public service in order to find fair solutions that are necessary to maintain support for our soldiers as well as local communities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week the NDP leader attacked Canada's national interests on the world stage. EOS BOS In a move that was criticized by premiers, media and even members of his own party, the NDP leader argued against the pro-Canadian Keystone XL project that would create thousands of jobs on both sides of the border. EOS BOS The consequences of this trip were alarming. EOS BOS Hours after meeting the NDP leader, senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi voiced doubts about the Keystone project. EOS BOS Could the President of the Treasury Board inform the House what the government is doing to defend this pro-Canadian project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last week I joined the scores of provincial premiers, fellow cabinet ministers, Conservative caucus members, and indeed I joined union leaders, who had gone to Washington to argue in favour— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS President of the Treasury Board has the floor. EOS </s> BOS —to argue in favour of the Keystone XL pipeline, a pipeline that will bring thousands of jobs and opportunities for Canadians. EOS BOS At the same time, the NDP leader was in Washington pouring cold water on the project. EOS BOS He does not care about the jobs. EOS BOS He does not care about union members getting jobs. EOS BOS He is in it for the extremists in the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Burma's Rohingya Muslims are heavily persecuted, but the minister was just in Burma and did not even mention the Rohingyas. EOS BOS When the government killed the office of religious freedom, it said it was just about doing the same work a different way. EOS BOS Well, so much for that, because the office is gone. EOS BOS The projects have stopped, including projects in Burma. EOS BOS No replacement has even been announced, and there is no money in the budget for international human rights. EOS BOS Are all these changes coincidental, or is turning away from human rights the price to buy votes from dictators at the UN? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the promotion and protection of human rights, including freedom of religion, belief and conscience, is an integral part of Canada's constructive engagement in the world. EOS BOS Global Affairs is continuing this important work and its professionals are working hard on a transition to a comprehensive vision on human rights, including religious freedom of course. EOS BOS Dr. Bennett and our staff are working together. EOS BOS As a multicultural and multi-faith society, Canada is well positioned to champion peaceful pluralism, respect for diversity, and all human rights. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Transport Canada is investigating allegations that 57 rail cars were left parked on a mountain slope outside Revelstoke, B.C., without proper handbrakes. EOS BOS After what we have learned from the Lac-Mégantic disaster, it is unbelievable that another train loaded with dangerous cargo may have been left unattended and another community put at risk. EOS BOS The Transportation Safety Board is reporting increased incidents of derailments, runaway trains, and violations of rail safety rules. EOS BOS Will this government get serious and enforce safety rules to prevent more rail disasters? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we in this government care deeply about rail safety, especially after the tragic events at Lac-Mégantic. EOS BOS I can assure the member that we are looking into this at the moment. EOS BOS Transport Canada officials are specifically looking at this case. EOS BOS We will report back when we have the final verdict. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite the House's unanimous support for a motion that I moved during the last session, the matter of non-designated airports in Canada has still not been resolved. EOS BOS Let us talk about it at the Sherbrooke airport. EOS BOS Given the promises his party and its members have made, can the Minister of Transport give us an update on the development of the much-touted mechanism that non-designated airports have long been waiting for and that would finally allow them to reach agreements with airlines? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS There are 89 designated airports in Canada, where security is provided by Transport Canada. EOS BOS The previous government implemented a mechanism whereby other non-designated airports can have access to the same security system on a cost-recovery basis. EOS BOS I know that the Sherbrooke airport is one of the six airports that applied. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Halifax's Phillip Wood is a 92-year-old veteran of World War II and the Korean conflict. EOS BOS In a recent letter to the editor, he called the decision to close the veterans offices “one more unfeeling and ruthless action”.Like many others, Mr. Wood believes the government is cutting critical services so it can offer goodies in time for the next election. EOS BOS When the government tables the budget tomorrow, will it listen to Mr. Wood, reopen those offices, and start treating our veterans with respect? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are treating our veterans with respect. EOS BOS I am proud of our government's demonstrated support for our veterans and their families. EOS BOS This support includes over 650 points of service to assist veterans; home visits by registered nurses or case managers; grass cutting, snow clearing, and home cleaning; 17 operational stress injury clinics; 24 integrative personnel support centres; and much more. EOS BOS The list can go on and on, but throughout, the opposition parties have never supported us in many of these initiatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the last election, the Liberals made a specific commitment to support justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka following terrible crimes committed at the end of the civil war and in light of ongoing human rights concerns for the Tamil community today. EOS BOS Instead of acting, the Liberals cancelled the office of religious freedom, undercutting existing initiatives to promote pluralism and human rights, and their new office has been completely absent on this. EOS BOS Why has the government failed to take any concrete action to implement its commitment with respect to human rights in Sri Lanka? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, human rights is a foundational part of Canada's international work. EOS BOS I will correct the record, because the member knows full well that this government tripled funding to the new Office of Human Rights, Freedoms and Inclusion. EOS BOS When it comes to human rights around the world, this government is taking a leadership role. EOS BOS We are doing this in all of our engagements. EOS BOS I hope the Conservative opposition will join us in helping to promote and defend human rights, as we are doing around the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Ontario Power Generation wants to dump abandoned radioactive nuclear waste next to the Great Lakes. EOS BOS It cannot say that this waste will not leak, nor has it considered any other options. Burying nuclear waste has a 100% failure rate. EOS BOS The last set of nuclear waste that was buried actually caught on fire. EOS BOS This madness has to stop and at the risk of the health and safety of future generations, including my daughter and many other youth who are visiting Ottawa today, we need to say no. EOS BOS This is on the minister's desk right now. EOS BOS Will the minister stop the plan to dump nuclear waste down a hole, walk away and leave it for future generations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is restoring the confidence in environmental assessments in ensuring that decisions are based on the best available scientific evidence. EOS BOS As the hon. EOS BOS member knows, this is under active consideration. EOS BOS The minister had asked for an extension to consider alternative sites. EOS BOS We are going through that process, but everyone can rest assured the decision will be based on science and data. EOS BOS We will make those decisions in a responsible and sound environmental manner. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, on the initiative of Ed Broadbent, the Canadian government promised to put an end to child poverty by 2000. EOS BOS Twenty-five years have passed, and both Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to meet that goal. EOS BOS In Canada, one in five children is living in poverty. EOS BOS We need to take immediate action here at home. EOS BOS Rather than implementing tax policies that will benefit only the wealthy, will the government finally take practical measures to eliminate child poverty? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously all Canadians and all parties want to continue to alleviate child poverty, and we hope to one day eliminate it. EOS BOS However, there is good news. EOS BOS The low-income rate for children has declined significantly from a peak of over 18% under the Liberal government to 8.5% currently. EOS BOS That means that there are over 700,000 fewer children living in poverty. EOS BOS Here is what UNICEF had to say on the subject:If Canada is faring better than other western countries in this regard, it is due to measures that are favourable to families, like tax credits, fiscal measures and benefits that are maintained or put in place to counter the effects of [poverty]. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago the House unanimously adopted Ed Broadbent's motion to end child poverty in Canada by the year 2000, yet child poverty levels have remained tragically high. EOS BOS That is an entire generation of children who have needlessly grown up in poverty. EOS BOS One in five Canadian children lives in poverty today. EOS BOS There is no excuse for such a wealthy country like ours not to look after our most vulnerable members, our children. EOS BOS Will the government commit to taking immediate action to eliminate poverty in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, we will. EOS BOS We have already done so. EOS BOS While we all continue to hope for the elimination of child poverty one day, the NDP refuses to recognize that there has been progress made. EOS BOS In fact, the low-income rate for children has declined significantly from a peak of over 18% under the Liberal government to 8.5% currently, with over 700,000 fewer Canadian children living in low-income families. EOS BOS This is in part because of the enormous benefits created by the government for low-income families, which led UNICEF recently to say that if Canada was faring better than other western countries in this regard, it was due to measures that were favourable to families, like tax credits, fiscal measures and benefits that were maintained or put in place to counter the effects of the global crisis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, giving a huge tax break to the wealthiest families, while completely ignoring the poorest families, is not an answer to poverty. EOS BOS That same UNICEF report is the one that is saying that one in five Canadian children lives in poverty today. EOS BOS Those children deserve better. EOS BOS Poverty impacts their ability to learn, to develop, to be healthy, to be fully integrated in their communities, and they need real action. EOS BOS Will the government support NDP Motion No. EOS BOS 534 to create a national plan to eliminate child poverty? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, we will. EOS BOS However, unlike the NDP, we will take more than just rhetorical measures. EOS BOS We are taking real, concrete action. EOS BOS This is the government that cut the GST by two points while maintaining the low-income GST rebate at 7%, meaning a $1.1 billion benefit for low-income families. EOS BOS This is the government that has lifted a million low-income families off the tax rolls altogether. EOS BOS This is the government that introduced the universal child care benefit, which provides now and next year over $1,900 for each family. EOS BOS That means a single mom with two kids under the age of six will be receiving $3,800 in cash benefit that the NDP would take away. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the latest victim of the Conservatives' obsession with secrecy and their intolerance of dissent is the chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada. EOS BOS He is the second senior official to quit because of the government's attempts to muzzle them. EOS BOS [Translation]Why are they so obsessed, to the point of hiring 1,500 spin doctors to control the message coming from the Prime Minister's Office? EOS BOS Why are they so determined to muzzle any dissenters and scare away government officials who play a vital role? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, as I said yesterday regarding Statistics Canada, I understand the individual wants to seize an opportunity to work in the private sector, since the data is free. EOS BOS I want to reiterate that we thank him for his years of service in the public sector. EOS BOS That being said, we have been improving the system with things like the national household survey. EOS BOS With regard to this, the national collection response rate is now at 69.3%, well above the target of 50%. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last month we celebrated International Women's Day. EOS BOS Although that important day has passed, we must remain vigilant and remember that women and children across Canada are disproportionately affected by domestic violence. EOS BOS Could the hon. EOS BOS Minister of Status of Women please advise the House of the steps her department is taking to ensure that women and their children fleeing intimate partner violence are able to find shelters and other services to help them rebuild their lives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, ensuring women and their children are free from violence is a priority for this government, and that is why I am working with my colleagues and experts across the country to develop a federal gender-based violence strategy. EOS BOS Shelters are also key to supporting this goal, which is why we announced in our budget that we will create over 3,000 shelter spaces over the next two years ensuring that more women have a safe place to turn in violent situations. EOS BOS By enabling women and girls to live violence-free, we can move closer to gender equality. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada came together as a nation when our railway was completed from coast to coast, but through neglect and millions in budget cuts, the government is stripping VIA Rail of its ability to deliver services to Canadians. EOS BOS People in Gaspé and New Brunswick are losing vital rail services. EOS BOS How can the government justify tabling estimates with another $4 million cut to VIA Rail? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we know, VIA Rail is responsible for its own operational decisions. EOS BOS Regardless, there is one truism here. EOS BOS Our government does support a passenger rail network, but that passenger rail network has to meet the needs of today's travellers as well as be fair and not burden the taxpayer. EOS BOS We expect VIA Rail to operate in that manner. EOS BOS Indeed, that is exactly what it is doing. EOS BOS We are concerned that it does continue to post significant losses regardless of how much money we are putting into the system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for months, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have tried to minimize the devastating impact that their tax changes will have on our local businesses. EOS BOS Once again today, the government has made an announcement that does not address the serious concerns of the business owners who create jobs in our communities. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister allow this incompetence and this farce to carry on, when January 1st is fast approaching? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on January 1st, every single one of our small businesses will see their taxes cut. EOS BOS This is good news for the middle class and for those who are working hard to join it. EOS BOS However, we have made changes to ensure that the wealthiest Canadians cannot find ways to bring their taxes down to a lower rate than that paid by middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS This simplification will not only help many people continue to do what they are doing to help their families, but it will also ensure that the wealthiest Canadians do not benefit even more. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this whole file since July 18 has been a complete disaster, and here we are almost six months later and the government still does not have simple answers to very worried small business owners across the country. EOS BOS Everyone knows that the Prime Minister is raising taxes so he can keep spending on his personal priorities and the priorities of his wealthy friends: hundreds of millions of dollars for his friends at Bombardier; half a billion dollars for his rich friends who run a bank in Asia; and $10 million for a convicted terrorist who murdered an allied solider. EOS BOS Canadians do not want to pay his bills, so will the PM finally end his attack on small business owners? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, only the Conservatives could see lowering taxes on small businesses as an attack on small businesses. EOS BOS That is how partisan they have become. EOS BOS The fact is the first thing we did was to lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS Everything we have done since then, including the Canada child benefit, increasing the GIS for seniors, and now lowering taxes for all small businesses across this country, is helping the middle class and helping to grow our booming economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the very first thing the Prime Minister did was to cancel the tax cut for small business owners. EOS BOS It was Conservatives who forced him to bring it back. EOS BOS That is not all. EOS BOS He has tried to raise taxes on health and dental benefits. EOS BOS He has gone after employee benefits, the waitresses and waiters and retail workers. EOS BOS He has tried to raise taxes on our brave women and men in the armed forces, and he has even had to apologize for raising taxes on Canadians living with diabetes. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister not just come clean and admit that all of these tax hikes are the consequences of his out of control spending and massive deficits? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our approach has focused on growing the middle class and making sure that Canadians have a real and fair opportunity to succeed, and across the country we are seeing the benefits of that happening. EOS BOS This year we created 441,000 new jobs, which is the top number for job creation in 18 years in this country. EOS BOS This is the kind of result that our leadership on the economy has delivered, and those members cannot say anything about it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Biwaase’aa is the after-school program for aboriginal youth in Thunder Bay. EOS BOS It provides healthy food, recreational activities, first nations cultural teachings and emotional support to some 500 students in seven elementary schools. EOS BOS It does this for $5 per day per student. EOS BOS By all measurements, it is a program that should be replicated, not cut, yet the government has cut funding after a decade of success. EOS BOS It finds billions for limos, gazebos, jails and jets. EOS BOS That is no problem. EOS BOS Why is it cutting valuable programs like Biwaase’aa? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is focused on ways to maintain the essential work we do to make Canada a better place for first nations, Inuit, Métis and northerners, but in better and more efficient ways. EOS BOS We are achieving reductions by reducing the costs of operations while protecting services in communities as much as we possibly can. EOS BOS We are working closely with all our employees to make sure this transition happens in the least disruptive, most effective and most transparent way possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today, Macleans's magazine published the article, “ EOS BOS The Silent Treatment”, an exposé of the government's mishandling of CCSVI.It details explosive conflicts of interest, politics over science, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research admitting, “We had not seen the crisis coming”.Today I intend to place a motion on notice, calling on the government to ensure the health committee investigates CIHR's handling of the development of a registry and clinical trials for CCSVI.Will the Minister of Health commit to an investigation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has worked hard to advance research in MS to improve the health of those living with this horrible condition. EOS BOS Along with MS patients, we hope that the research will contribute to a cure. EOS BOS Over the past five years we have invested more than $27 million in MS research, and we are supporting the development of an MS monitoring system that will provide patients and health care providers with better understanding of the disease and its treatments. EOS BOS It is critical that we complete clinical trials for CCSVI to assess the safety and effectiveness of this procedure. EOS BOS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration agreed, and warned health practitioners of the need for approval before using it to treat people with MS. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is taking $15 billion away from communities, money that has already been announced for public transit, for green infrastructure, and for rural and northern communities. EOS BOS This is a betrayal. EOS BOS The communities across this country have been waiting and planning for this money to build important infrastructure projects and to create much-needed jobs. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals creating high-risk schemes that will fail communities and out-of-work Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear. EOS BOS We announced yesterday an historic plan for investing in infrastructure. EOS BOS It is an important plan that provides a $2-billion investment in rural communities. EOS BOS It is an historic plan that provides, as well, a significant amount for a Canada infrastructure bank that is going to allow us to do even more with our infrastructure dollars for transformational projects. EOS BOS We have set out something that we know will have a big impact on our economy and on jobs both today and tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to reports, job creation over the last year was half of what it was over the five previous years, and no full-time jobs were created. EOS BOS The Liberals have increased the debt, and yesterday the finance minister announced that he will borrow yet another $32 billion. EOS BOS This is for the same infrastructure plan that resulted in zero job gains. EOS BOS When will the government admit that this is a failed plan and heed the advice of leading economists and stop spending more taxpayer dollars? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is important to know that we are moving forward on our plan, because we know that it is the right thing to do, but we also know that leading economists around the world are looking at what Canada is doing and are saying that this is absolutely what we should do. EOS BOS With the fiscal situation we have and the opportunity to make investments, we are moving forward, because we know it is better for our economy, it is better for Canadians, and it will create jobs. EOS BOS I can say that Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says she hopes that our policies go viral around the world. EOS BOS Leading economists recognize that we are doing exactly what we should be doing at this time for our economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is another example of the Conservatives' environmental mismanagement. EOS BOS According to internal documents, $24 million of taxpayers' money was wasted on ads to promote the Keystone pipeline. EOS BOS The Conservatives used $24 million belonging to Canadians to help their friends in the oil industry— EOS BOS the richest companies in the country—and for what? EOS BOS Nothing. EOS BOS What a waste of public funds. EOS BOS The Conservatives will stop at nothing to please their friends in the oil industry. EOS BOS Why not let the oil companies do their own advertising? EOS BOS Why is the government subsidizing them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is proud to promote Canada as a destination for business investment and responsible resource development. EOS BOS It is our job to show key international markets that Canada is a world-class, environmentally responsible energy partner. EOS BOS We will not apologize for promoting the lifeblood of the Canadian economy on the world stage. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, internal documents show the Conservatives blew $24 million on U.S. ads to promote the Keystone XL pipeline, but subway ads and online pop-ups cannot mask their poor environmental record. EOS BOS In fact, a survey showed that no one even knew what the ads were all about. EOS BOS That is $24 million of our tax dollars to advertise for some of the richest companies in Canada. EOS BOS It seems the Conservative government will do anything to help its rich oil buddies. EOS BOS Why can the oil companies not do their own advertising? EOS BOS Why the subsidy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is our job to raise awareness in key international markets and demonstrate that Canada is a world-class, environmentally responsible energy partner, particularly with the United States. EOS BOS When NDP members go to Washington, they attack Canadian workers. EOS BOS They call the oil sands a disease. EOS BOS They oppose projects that have been approved by independent regulatory reviews. EOS BOS Canadians know that the NDP has no leg to stand on when it comes to defending Canada's natural resources. EOS BOS We will. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he said nothing about the 50 years. EOS BOS The Minister of the Environment, the member for Nunavut, said in the House that stories about her constituents eating out of a garbage dump were “untrue”. EOS BOS However, it did happen as anyone who watches APTN can see. EOS BOS Could the minister confirm that her office contacted Rankin Inlet and demanded an apology for making public the fact that people in her riding were eating out of a landfill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the allegations are completely false. EOS BOS The Minister of the Environment was born and raised in the Arctic, and she knows how important access to healthy food is for our children and our families. EOS BOS The minister was troubled when she heard these reports about families struggling to find food. EOS BOS As the member of Parliament for Nunavut, it is her responsibility to listen to the concerns of her constituents and to act on their behalf. EOS BOS That is why she called her constituents to get the facts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, because the Conservative government's program failed to lower the cost of food, there is a food crisis in northern Canada. EOS BOS While residents of Rankin Inlet are reduced to scavenging in dumps to feed themselves, all the Minister of the Environment cares about is managing public relations and demanding apologies from the local authorities who spoke out about the situation. EOS BOS It is appalling. EOS BOS Does the minister realize that the only thing she should be concerned about right now is that people in her riding are eating out of dumps and that she needs to help them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister made a statement. EOS BOS She was troubled when she heard about the recent reports about families in Rankin Inlet struggling to find food, so she followed up with her constituents to address these concerns. EOS BOS She also contacted the senior administrative officer in Rankin Inlet to learn more about these concerns and reports. EOS BOS At no time did she speak to the deputy mayor during this phone conversation, and at no time did she or her office request an apology from anyone in the hamlet. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives really have no shame. EOS BOS They are the ones who made a mess of the Nutrition North Canada program. EOS BOS Despite the $60 million that has been invested, the cost of food in the north has not gone down. EOS BOS The result is that dozens of people are having to scavenge in the dump to feed themselves. EOS BOS The Minister of the Environment wants those who spoke out about the situation to apologize? EOS BOS She cannot be serious. EOS BOS She should apologize for the failure of this program. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives actually capable of coming up with a program that works? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, the allegations are false. EOS BOS The truth is that the results of our government's actions are very clear. EOS BOS Nutrition North Canada has shipped a total of 61 million kilograms of nutritious and perishable food to northern communities since 2011. EOS BOS The minister remains committed to working on behalf of her constituents to improve the program. EOS BOS For example, last week, the government announced an additional investment of $11 million in 2014-15 to improve the program. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing the Liberals can be proud of, it is their ability to come up with slogans. EOS BOS They come up with empty slogans, as in their plan to help Canadian businesses create jobs, slogans on the environment to justify a new carbon tax, and slogans on infrastructure investment, instead of getting projects off the ground. EOS BOS I have one for them: when will the Liberals get out of the way, lower taxes on middle-class businesses, and help those working hard to create jobs in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what we know is necessary in our economy is to ensure that Canadian consumers, middle-class Canadians, those people who actually need to be able to buy things for their families, are being put in a good situation. EOS BOS That is why we introduced the Canada child benefit. EOS BOS That is why we lowered middle-class taxes. EOS BOS What those things will do is allow people to put more money into our economy. EOS BOS Together with the investments we are making, what that will do is help us to grow our economy so that businesses, small businesses, medium-sized businesses, large businesses, in our country can be successful, creating jobs for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government is reneging on one promise after another, and it seems incapable of learning from its past mistakes. EOS BOS Justice Gascon will finally fill Quebec's seat on the Supreme Court of Canada this week, and we congratulate him. EOS BOS However, it is deplorable that Justice Gascon was appointed without any debate and without consulting parliamentarians. EOS BOS This is very worrisome, given that Justice LeBel announced a few months ago that he will be retiring. EOS BOS How will the government involve Parliament in selecting the next Supreme Court justice? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the appointment of Justice Gascon to the Supreme Court of Canada was an excellent one. EOS BOS We congratulate him today on taking his seat. EOS BOS When making all appointments, our government conducts broad consultations with prominent members of the legal community and the province affected by the vacant seat. EOS BOS This includes the government of that province, the justice minister of that province, the chief of the superior court of that province, the Canadian Bar Association, and legal societies of that province. EOS BOS In all of these consultations, we ask for names as well as advice on competence and qualities for the position. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice seems to be forgetting is that the government promised to be transparent and more open and to allow parliamentarians to have a say. EOS BOS I will repeat the question. EOS BOS We know that Justice LeBel will be leaving at the end of November. EOS BOS Can we expect the government to consult parliamentarians and tell us how that will happen? EOS BOS I realize that the Conservatives consult the entire legal world, but my question referred to parliamentarians. EOS BOS Furthermore, can we in Quebec expect the appointment to be made as soon as Justice LeBel leaves? EOS </s> BOS As always, Mr. Speaker, the government will consult broadly. EOS BOS These appointments have always been a matter of the executive and will continue to be so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for the last year and a half, first nation chiefs have been asking to meet with the Prime Minister and discuss the housing crisis on first nation reserves. EOS BOS After years of government inaction, it tragically took this crisis in Attawapiskat for him to finally take up the invitation. EOS BOS More than just talk is needed. EOS BOS Is the government finally prepared to work with first nations and take real action to solve this crisis? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government works with first nations to deliver real results for their priorities. EOS BOS We have invested heavily in first nation schools, including in Attawapiskat, and in water and waste water infrastructure, health and housing, and we have done this all in full partnership with first nations. EOS BOS We have a plan. EOS BOS We will continue to invest in practical solutions and real results. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all of a sudden, the Conservatives are waking up and blaming everyone but themselves. EOS BOS Federal public servants went to Attawapiskat not once, not twice, not three times, but 10 times in the past year. EOS BOS They must have submitted reports on the situation. EOS BOS Has there been any follow-up to these visits or is the department in the habit of leaving reports on shelves to gather dust rather than taking action as required?Is the conclusion here that the government is completely indifferent to the living conditions of aboriginal people? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our first priority is to get residents into warm, dry and safe shelter. EOS BOS Each time we received a request from the community, we took immediate action. EOS BOS Our officials have been working with the community to address substantial renovation for immediate housing needs, and we continue to support implementing their emergency management plan. EOS BOS At the same time, we will be working with the third party manager to ensure that federal funding directly benefits community members and that the community's long-term needs will be met. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Government of Quebec has joined the growing chorus against Bill C-51, criticizing the federal government's unilateral approach and the impact Bill C-51 will have on Quebeckers' fundamental rights. EOS BOS The federal government has a responsibility to consult the provinces on such fundamental issues. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives agree to our request to hear from three Quebec ministers in committee, namely the ministers of justice, public security and Canadian intergovernmental affairs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have already had the opportunity to meet with my Quebec counterpart, Minister Lise Thériault, and talk to her about the measures—the balanced bill—that we want to put in place to protect Canadians from the terrorist threat. EOS BOS We are going to continue working not only with the provinces, but also with police forces. EOS BOS That is one reason why it is so important to share information. EOS BOS I assured her that the federal government would share information with the provincial and municipal police forces to protect Canadians from the terrorist threat. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government continues to stand up for hard-working Canadians. EOS BOS We proposed in the Speech EOS BOS From the Throne that consumers should only have to pay for television channels they actually want to watch. EOS BOS Last week we fulfilled that commitment, and Canadians will finally be able to buy only the channels they actually want. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Canadian Heritage please tell the House more about this good news for all Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for that great question. EOS BOS Our government has said all along that Canadians should not have to pay for channels they do not want in order to get the ones they do. EOS BOS As we stated in our Speech From the Throne, we promised to provide consumers with more choice in channels, and we have, in fact, delivered. EOS BOS This will not only give more choice to consumers but will also help Canadian families make the best decisions on how to spend their hard-earned dollars. EOS BOS This is a win-win, and we are very proud on this side of the House to have delivered this wonderful news. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday CIBC's former chief economist said that the energy east pipeline makes no sense from a strictly economic standpoint. EOS BOS Last week the Parkland Institute demonstrated that Canada cannot expand its energy sector and reduce its greenhouse gas reduction targets without destroying all other economic sectors. EOS BOS Between the economy, the environment, and the oil sands, one of them will perish. EOS BOS As long as we are talking about democratic reform, I propose a preferential vote on this. EOS BOS Can the government specify, in order of preference, which of the three it would like to sacrifice? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we believe that environmental sustainability and economic growth go hand in hand. EOS BOS That is why, when we assess these energy projects, we look at all aspects of their consequences on the environment and on jobs for Canadians. EOS BOS The energy east project is not yet before the regulator, and when it is, there will be many months for the members opposite to offer their opinions on both economic growth and environmental sustainability. EOS BOS I invite them to do both of those things. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we learned that after campaigning on a tax increase for the province's well-heeled citizens and then raising their taxes, the Liberal government in New Brunswick is realizing that this is not working and that the government coffers are bare. EOS BOS You cannot create wealth by raising everyone's taxes. EOS BOS Why is this government being so stubborn? EOS BOS Why is the Minister of Finance bent on raising Canadians' taxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I just want to say how much I appreciate the question from the hon. EOS BOS member, because it provides me with an opportunity to remind all the people here that we actually lowered taxes on nine million Canadians. EOS BOS As of January 1 this year, nine million Canadians have more money in their pockets. EOS BOS It is true that we raised taxes on a very small proportion of Canadians, whom perhaps the hon. EOS BOS member is talking about. EOS BOS We recognize that we have helped the vast majority of people in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, middle-class Canadians need Liberal governments to get out of the way and not raise their taxes. EOS BOS That is simple. EOS BOS If it keeps raising taxes, there will be less revenue and fewer jobs. EOS BOS When will the finance minister realize that taxing Canadians is not a solution for prosperity in this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians elected a new government on October 19. EOS BOS They recognized that we had a plan. EOS BOS We had a plan to deal with low growth through bringing forward a new approach. EOS BOS We reduced taxes on the middle class, which will stimulate the economy while helping nine million Canadians. EOS BOS We are going to help the most vulnerable people in this country by giving them a Canada child benefit. EOS BOS We are going to stimulate the economy through infrastructure investments that can make a real long-term difference in productivity for this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the UPA and the Government of Quebec both called on the federal government to regulate imports of diafiltered milk. EOS BOS This morning, a central-Quebec-based group of agri-food advocates known as the Front commun de la filière agroalimentaire weighed in. EOS BOS On page 127 of the budget, the government talks about eliminating tariffs on food manufacturing ingredients other than supply-managed products. EOS BOS Does the government really want to eliminate tariffs on diafiltered milk, which is contrary to the wishes of Quebec, the UPA and the Front commun? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very aware of issues with enforcement of our rules surrounding supply management. EOS BOS As my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, has already said, we support supply management and we do so with our trade policy. EOS BOS We are reviewing these rules right now and working very hard on it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to table the following documents, in both official languages. EOS BOS They deal with ministerial conduct, and I would be happy to read it out. EOS BOS It states, “Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries must act with honesty and must uphold the highest ethical standards... EOS BOS ”Some hon. EOS BOS members: No. EOS BOS Mr. EOS BOS Blaine Calkins: EOS BOS It goes on and says that— EOS </s> BOS I think the hon. member has heard that there is no unanimous consent. EOS BOS I know he would like to read for a while, but there is no unanimous consent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Conservatives said that federal penitentiaries have the tools to prevent helicopter-assisted escapes. EOS BOS That is true. EOS BOS What they did not say is that Quebec prisons do not have the same tools. EOS BOS That is entirely the Conservatives' fault. EOS BOS I have a letter dated October 24, 2013, in which the Quebec minister asks Ottawa to regulate airspace over Quebec prisons. EOS BOS Because the government ignored Quebec's request, three dangerous criminals escaped from prison and are now on the run. EOS BOS How could the Minister of Transport ignore the letter from the Government of Quebec and its request? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure my colleague. EOS BOS We all know that three criminals are on the loose. EOS BOS We are supporting the Government of Quebec's efforts to catch these dangerous individuals. EOS BOS If the member or anyone else has information, they can contact Canadian or Quebec authorities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I give my best wishes to indigenous people and all Canadians on National Aboriginal Day. EOS BOS Northerners know the economic benefits national parks bring through increased tourism. EOS BOS With the expansion of Nahanni National Park Reserve and the creation of the East Arm National Park, northerners have shown their commitment to these heritage sites. EOS BOS However, with the Conservatives reckless cuts to Parks Canada, northerners are concerned that this vital form of sustainable economic development will be delayed or severely crippled. EOS BOS Why is the minister cutting back on the government's promise to fully fund these northern parks? EOS BOS Is it the government's opinion that parks do not create jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to note that, since 2006, this government has protected more parkland than any other government in recent history. We are committed to protecting Canada's parks. EOS BOS We are also proud of the fine work that Parks Canada staff do to promote Canada and promote our great natural heritage. EOS BOS However, a concept that the opposition does not understand is being wise stewards of taxpayer dollars. EOS BOS In fact, one could say that its ability to manage the economy is like a dine and dash: order the most expensive thing on a menu and then stick someone else with the bill.We have decided to ensure that we are wise stewards of taxpayer dollars, while managing the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate in my riding to have a tourism jewel, the Pointe-au-Père Lighthouse National Historic Site. EOS BOS The existing agreement provided low-cost service to Parks Canada and let thousands of tourists visit the site. EOS BOS However, Parks Canada has slapped the site managers in the face by taking over management of the port of Pointe-au-Père. EOS BOS Hours will be reduced, the season will be shortened and fees will double, all because management of the port is being taken away from an organization that has done a great job for 30 years. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Tourism commit to review this ill-considered decision by Parks Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government remains committed to protecting our natural heritage, including under the scope of Parks Canada. EOS BOS We maintain funding and we maintain staff to ensure that those artifacts, those facilities are well protected and well maintained. EOS BOS We certainly feel that the measures included in budget 2012 will continue to protect the great natural heritage of the country and the facilities that Parks Canada manages. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 98% of Canadians choose not to join political parties, yet political parties have the exclusive right to raise money and issue generous tax credit receipts outside of an election period. EOS BOS Moreover, a candidate aligned with a party can transfer an electoral surplus to a riding association and is eligible for a 50% reimbursement for all qualified election expenses. EOS BOS These are all advantages that are statutorily not available to independent candidates. EOS BOS Does the Minister of State for Democratic Reform not believe that the fair elections act should contain some actual fairness for the 98% of Canadians not associated with a political party? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the provisions that the member describes are features of the existing Canada Elections Act. EOS BOS They are not new provisions created by the fair elections act. EOS BOS I note that he has made some suggestions and I invite him to bring them to me for my consideration. EOS BOS He might also consider sending them on to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which is responsible for studying the matter. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, you will remember that Speaker Milliken used to say that he worked harder in the last week of every session than he did in all of the weeks leading up to that last week when tempers rise. EOS BOS New Democrats have a particular question coming out of question period, in which you involved yourself over several questions. EOS BOS This is an important point on which we will seek clarification from you. EOS BOS [Translation]There was a very personal attack from an unelected and unaccountable senator on the member for Terrebonne—Blainville. EOS BOS That is the crux of the issue. EOS BOS The government and the Prime Minister's Office have controlled many aspects of the Senate. EOS BOS Our question about the involvement of the Prime Minister's Office is at the heart of the issue involving the member for Terrebonne—Blainville. EOS BOS [English]Mr. EOS BOS Speaker, we will be looking forward to some intervention on your part and your office's part to explain how it is that MPs cannot ask questions, when it has been proven in RCMP-filed evidence that the Prime Minister's Office has involved itself and in fact controlled many aspects of what happens in that other place, the Senate. EOS BOS Therefore, when an attack goes against a member of the House from any party from a member of that chamber, it is now a viable and living question as to the implications of the Prime Minister's Office and the coordination and thinking out of that attack. EOS BOS We will look forward to your ruling and guidance in this matter. EOS </s> BOS I appreciate the hon. opposition House leader's rising to seek some clarification and guidance EOS BOS . I will, of course, endeavour to do just that. EOS BOS As the member well knows, during question period the Speaker does try to ensure that the main principle, which is to hold the government to account and ensure that questions touch on the administrative responsibilities of government, is upheld. EOS BOS Sometimes questions are phrased a certain way that makes it more difficult for the Chair to parse the words and draw the line. EOS BOS However, I will endeavour to come back to the House and perhaps point to some examples in the past and remind the House of some of the principles that are espoused in the procedural books that try to guide us during question period. EOS
BOS It is my pleasure to welcome onto the floor of the chamber many of the athletes who competed in the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria last March, led by the chef de mission and the 2017 honorary coach. EOS BOS (1520) EOS BOS These athletes on the floor of the chamber and in the gallery have competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, floor hockey, snowshoeing, and speed skating. EOS BOS Canadians from across the country are justly proud of you, and so are we. EOS BOS Like them, we appreciate the years of training and sacrifice, and the determination it takes to become a world-class athlete. EOS BOS [Translation]
              You are all champions. EOS BOS You are an inspiration to your fellow Canadians. EOS BOS [English] EOS BOS Today is also an opportunity to recognize coaches, mission staff, and Special Olympics Canada for their hard work and dedication. EOS BOS Many of them are sitting in the gallery, and I would ask them to stand. EOS BOS Congratulations again, félicitations, thank you all for representing Canada so well in the Special Olympics, and good luck in your future endeavours:

              [Translation] EOS BOS The Chair All members are invited to a reception in room 237-C to meet our distinguished guests. EOS BOS [ EOS BOS And Canada's 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games athletes having left the Chamber:] EOS </s> BOS The committee will rise and I will leave the Chair. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, when the Liberals took office, they said that the one-way conversations with the provinces were over. EOS BOS However, from what we have been hearing about the health transfer negotiations, it seems nothing has really changed. EOS BOS The Quebec health minister thinks that the federal government's approach is a trap. EOS BOS Isn't that the truth. EOS BOS The Liberals are trying to sugar-coat it, but they are offering the provinces the same $36-billion cut to federal health transfers that the Conservatives before them were offering. EOS BOS Can the minister explain the difference between the Conservatives' health care cuts and the Liberals'? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the difference is that our government is working hard with the provinces and territories. EOS BOS We are having excellent discussions with my counterparts across the country. EOS BOS Yesterday, I spoke to the Quebec and Ontario health ministers. EOS BOS We will continue to work together. EOS BOS I would like to remind members that the Canada health transfer is going to increase by over $1 billion next year, bringing it up to more than $37 billion. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Health called her cut to the health care escalator reasonable. EOS BOS The Liberals used different adjectives when this cut was first announced by Stephen Harper. EOS BOS The member for Vancouver Centre, who was the Liberal health critic, said it was walking away from medicare. EOS BOS The member for Toronto—St. EOS BOS Paul's, now a Liberal cabinet minister, said it would leave Canadians “out in the cold”. EOS BOS The member for Ottawa South called the Conservatives' approach “unconscionable and indefensible”.How does the minister explain to Canadians this blatant, undeniable reversal? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, this is a government that is interested in collaborating with all of our partners across the country. EOS BOS I will remind the member opposite to clarify something that he said yesterday. EOS BOS He talked about health care spending increasing. EOS BOS In fact, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, across this country annual health care spending has declined by an average of 0.6% since 2011. EOS BOS That is in the context of the Canadian health transfer increasing by 6%.We are going to increase it next year. EOS BOS There will be more than $1 billion extra added to the Canada health transfer. EOS BOS In addition to that, there will be new investments in the areas important to Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the leakage of information, the sharing of information, the selling of information by Mr. Jeffrey Delisle to the Russians has been described by members of the government as the damage is astronomical, the damage is exceptionally grave, the damage is simply huge. EOS BOS This went undetected for 50 months. EOS BOS When a breach of security of this kind happens, it is usually followed by a judicial inquiry. EOS BOS When will there be a judicial inquiry in the case of Jeffrey Delisle? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. EOS BOS member, and certainly assure the House and all Canadians, that the Canadian Forces takes these issues very seriously, particularly, where sensitive information is involved. EOS BOS The member will knows that the matter is still before the court and this individual is still facing sentencing. EOS BOS For that, we will not be discussing it in the House of Commons or publicly. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at the Davos billionaires convention, at meetings in New York and closed door Shangri-La meetings in Toronto, and in talks with officials and ministers ever since, the richest people on earth have been directing the government on how the tax-funded infrastructure bank should work. EOS BOS Their instructions: they get all the profits from risky megaprojects, and taxpayers get all the losses. EOS BOS Why is the government giving a $35-billion bank to the world's wealthiest elite? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were elected on a platform to invest in a historic infrastructure plan, including developing an infrastructure bank. EOS BOS The infrastructure bank would engage private capital to build better public transit, energy transmission, trade corridors, and more across Canada. EOS BOS By engaging private capital in these projects, our investments will go further and free up more funding for the record investments we are making in things like social housing, disaster mitigation, women's shelters, and clean water and waste-water systems. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, imagine infrastructure were ice cream, and a wealthy aristocrat wanted to make money selling ice cream cones. EOS BOS If he made a profit from his sales, he could put it in his pocket, but in order to avoid losses, he has the Liberals set up the ice cream cone bank to ensure that taxpayers pay the price if he makes a loss. EOS BOS Why will the government not admit that this is a gigantic, $35-billion self-licking ice cream cone for the wealthy elite? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we value the expertise that those in the private sector can offer and thank those on the economic advisory council for their advice, for example. 
              We have engaged a number of actors across the country, including the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, unions, provinces, territories, indigenous peoples, engineers, construction firms, and more. EOS BOS We are proud of this level of engagement on the infrastructure bank design. EOS BOS From someone who comes from the private sector, for me this is absolutely a no-brainer. EOS BOS We look forward to continuing to speak with a wide range of actors. We will continue to do so, all in the interest of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister keeps repeating that any information we want about the infrastructure bank is available. EOS BOS However, through access to information, we obtained a document dated November 14, 2016, regarding a meeting arranged by BlackRock for its clients and attended by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Infrastructure, and several other government ministers. EOS BOS There is a little problem. EOS BOS It is impossible to see the guest list, because it was completely blacked out. EOS BOS The list remains a mystery, and the Liberals refuse to show it, but it exists. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us where to find it? EOS BOS If not, what is the government trying to hide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were elected on a promise to make historic investments worth $180 billion to build Canada for the 21st century.
              The session organized with BlackRock lasted just a few hours last fall, but we spent hundreds of hours consulting groups like the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, unions, the provinces and territories, academics, engineers, construction firms, and more. EOS BOS We are proud of the scope of our consultation on the development of this bank. EOS BOS We look forward to continuing our discussions with various groups, while we implement this important initiative. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the simple fact is that he cannot tell us where to find that list, so we have no way of knowing who is involved with this bank. EOS BOS Here is what the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, led by Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer, had to say: “ EOS BOS [The] case for establishing the CIB is not compelling, as it has the potential to increase overall costs to taxpayers while privatizing the most high-return, low-risk infrastructure assets. EOS BOS ”
              Nobody thinks this infrastructure bank is a good idea. EOS BOS When will the government drop it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if we mobilize private sector dollars to build new infrastructure projects, our investments will generate more spinoffs while freeing up public funds to invest even more in priorities such as social housing, disaster mitigation, women's shelters, drinking water, and wastewater treatment. EOS BOS We believe that this bank will benefit Canadian municipalities of all sizes, like the one represented by the member opposite, and we will continue to work with our partners to build better infrastructure and make good things happen for Canada in the 21st century. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have not denied that the projects funded through their privatization bank would result in user fees and tolls placed on Canadians. EOS BOS They have not denied that the projects will cost more and will result in significant delays. EOS BOS Will the government deny today that if offered the choice, Canadians would choose not to have user fees on infrastructure? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is an important question to be asked. EOS BOS Indeed the infrastructure bank is an effort to leverage private capital in projects where we see fit. EOS BOS Again, let me remind the hon. EOS BOS member that these projects are put forward to us and these are projects that we will, through the infrastructure bank, examine and make the right choices for Canadians. EOS BOS By engaging private capital in these projects, our investments will go further and free up more funding for the record investments we are making in things of importance to the member opposite, such as social housing, disaster mitigation, women's shelters, and the like. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I guess he did not answer because Canadians were not offered that choice. EOS BOS All week we have been asking specific questions about the secret Liberal infrastructure brought to us by BlackRock, and all week the Liberals have avoided clear answers, just like today. EOS BOS Instead they have responded with very tightly crafted talking points. EOS BOS Here is my question for the Liberals: Is the government using any messaging given to it by BlackRock, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we value the expertise that those in the private sector can offer and thank those people who have been giving us this input. EOS BOS If we are going to offer options to the private sector, we indeed need to consult these people and get their input and feedback as we put our best foot forward in how to leverage that private capital. EOS BOS It bears reminding the member that the session with BlackRock lasted only a few hours, but we spent hundreds of hours consulting on the infrastructure bank, including with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, unions, provinces, territories, academics, engineers, construction firms, and more. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is really sad. EOS BOS We are trying to get clear answers, but the government keeps feeding us the same old meaningless lines. EOS BOS We know that BlackRock had a big say in the creation of this bank. EOS BOS Just imagine the minister asking BlackRock to green-light his speech for the much talked about meeting in Toronto last November. EOS BOS Did BlackRock sign off on the minister's talking points too? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this bears repeating. EOS BOS The session with BlackRock last fall lasted only a few hours, but we spent hundreds of hours consulting stakeholders such as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, unions, the provinces and territories, indigenous peoples, academics, engineers, construction firms, and more. EOS BOS For those in the private sector, this consultation process is an extremely important part of making decisions about investments that will be leveraged to mobilize more infrastructure money to improve the lives of Canadians and Quebeckers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it certainly sounds as if someone else wrote that. EOS BOS In the debate yesterday on our motion calling for an in-depth study of the infrastructure bank, the government indicated that it had no intention of doing one. EOS BOS However, the report commissioned by the government recommended an in-depth study. EOS BOS We are talking about a bank that will be responsible for $35 billion of public funds. EOS BOS Since the bank will be responsible for taxpayers' money, does the government not think that this kind of investment deserves a more in-depth study? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in-depth studies require consultation with many people, as I said earlier. I will not repeat myself.
              We must consult the private sector, which will make those investments. EOS BOS It is worth mentioning that the KPMG report, just one of the reports we saw and examined, stated that the Canada infrastructure bank will accelerate economic development and growth, create major national projects, and ensure quick decision-making, considering the development that Canada needs now and in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we can say a lot about the fact that local business owners across the country have been under assault by the Liberal government's out-of-touch attack on their ability to create jobs. EOS BOS We can say a lot about the fact that the top 1% is actually paying less under the government's changes than before. EOS BOS We can say a heck of a lot about the damage the government is doing to the economy with its erratic behaviour on the trade front. EOS BOS Indeed, recently, the Prime Minister insulted Japan and Australia when he skipped a meeting that would have allowed Canada to sign onto the world's largest trading block. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister tell us what he is doing to repair the damage caused by his erratic behaviour? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what Stephen Harper did not understand, what those Conservatives over there continue not to understand, is that it is not just about signing any deal; it is about signing a good deal for Canadians. EOS BOS We saw time and time again that they are just in a rush to try to sign anything to get along, but we know that no deal is better than a bad deal. EOS BOS We will always stand up for Canadian interests, unlike those Conservatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not only Australia and Japan who are upset with the Prime Minister for his bizarre actions in Asia. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister assure us that with his recent behaviour in China, his begging for a free trade agreement at all costs, he has not compromised our position at the NAFTA negotiating table and the millions of jobs today that depend on free trade between Canada, the United States, and Mexico? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the Conservatives demonstrate that they still do not understand anything about getting a good trade deal for Canadians. EOS BOS Wherever we go around the world, we will be demanding a good deal for Canada. EOS BOS We are not going to follow the Conservative Harper doctrine of “any deal”, and capitulation, as a trade strategy. EOS BOS We are going to demand good outcomes for Canadians, on the environment, on labour issues, on a broad range of issues, because that is what Canadians elected us to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are nowhere near the head of the class when it comes to international aid. EOS BOS The government keeps saying that it is overly ambitious to dedicate 0.7% of our GDP to development aid, even over 10 years. EOS BOS However, all stakeholders expect the federal government to increase funding for international assistance in order to give Canada some credibility in meeting sustainable development goals. EOS BOS Will the minister show some ambition and commit to increasing international aid investments in budget 2017? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his interest in international development. EOS BOS As everyone knows, my mandate involves refocusing Canada's development assistance on helping the poorest, the most vulnerable, and fragile states. EOS BOS We conducted extensive consultations with 15,000 people from 65 countries. EOS BOS I can assure the House that we are going to have a policy that leverages Canada's strengths and focuses on areas where we can make a real difference. EOS BOS Canadians' money will be put to good use and will provide leverage to seek out additional partnerships. EOS BOS We will engage in development innovation and we will make a big difference while providing meaningful leadership. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Fabien Melanson is a veteran who bravely served his country. EOS BOS Despite his dedication, he is going to lose his home because the government sent his pension cheques to the wrong address. EOS BOS What should have been corrected with just a couple of calls has transformed into a true personal crisis. EOS BOS The Minister of Veterans Affairs' bungling of this file is pathetic. EOS BOS We have lost count of the number of veterans forced to go on a hunger strike in order to be heard. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives remedy this situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, that situation was addressed some time ago. EOS BOS We also apologized to the veteran and ensured that he has access to all the services and benefits to which he is entitled. EOS BOS I would like to make a suggestion to the member opposite. EOS BOS If he really wants to help veterans, he should support the 2012 budget, which maintains all benefits for veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we now know that problems related to pyrrhotite are not confined to the Mauricie region. EOS BOS Experts have confirmed cases in Mont-Laurier, in north Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec. EOS BOS It is no longer just a local problem, and the magnitude of the disaster could be even bigger. EOS BOS The government says that it has tightened the standard on aggregates in concrete, but the standard has not yet been published. EOS BOS Families that have to repair their house foundations have to foot a huge bill. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives stubbornly refusing to provide financial help to pyrrhotite victims? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the hon. EOS BOS member is well aware, the pyrrhotite problem falls under provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS The Government of Quebec has a provincial program to provide financial help to property owners dealing with damage caused by pyrrhotite. EOS BOS I invite anyone concerned about this problem to contact the Société d'habitation du Québec. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this summer, I had the opportunity to travel around my riding of Marc-Aurèle-Fortin in Laval to talk to many of my constituents and to again note the congestion on our roads. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities inform the House of the action taken to support public transit in Laval in order to improve the quality of life of workers and their families, who use it every day? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleague from Marc-Aurèle-Fortin for his question and his commitment to the citizens of Laval. EOS BOS On August 8, together with my four colleagues from Laval, I was delighted to announce that our government will be contributing more than $16.9 million to 29 public transportation projects in Laval, including the purchase of 22 hybrid buses, the renovation of many bus garages, and the addition and replacement of bus shelters. EOS BOS More reliable and efficient public transit systems will result in stronger communities in Quebec and Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative attacks on science and research are never-ending. EOS BOS The Conservatives have eliminated important scientific institutions like the Experimental Lakes Area and the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences. EOS BOS They have reduced investments in Statistics Canada and first nations data agencies. EOS BOS They have fired crucial scientists and researchers right across the public sector, and the ones that remain have been muzzled. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives possibly justify their science and research attacks? EOS BOS Do they not care about Canada's future? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. EOS BOS This government has made significant and important investments in science and technology at every single opportunity that we have had. EOS BOS We do that because science will create jobs, save lives and improve the quality of life, but every time we put forward more investments for our scientists, for our students, for our researchers, the NDP votes against those things. EOS BOS It is time the NDP started to support science for once. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has always been a consistent defender of supply management. EOS BOS By contrast, the Liberal Party offers no concrete proof of its position. EOS BOS The Liberals left supply management out of its election platform and constantly vote against measures that benefit our supply-managed farmers and all rural Canadians. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Agriculture please inform the House of the most recent example of how the Liberal Party is turning its back on our egg, dairy and poultry farmers? EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I have had to rule before that questions to the government have to touch on government areas of responsibility, and— Some hon. EOS BOS members: Oh, oh!The Speaker: Order, please. EOS BOS Asking about the position of another party is not a government area of responsibility. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members:  Oh, oh!The Speaker: Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member is out of time. EOS BOS [Translation]The hon. member for Marc-Aurèle-Fortin. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when Parliament chooses a new Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner all parties must be consulted. EOS BOS It is a legal obligation. EOS BOS However, we were not consulted. EOS BOS We only received one letter and one name. EOS BOS We know nothing about the other candidates, and the nominee was rushed through committee within one hour. EOS BOS Instead of a merit-based process, all we have are the Liberals' assurances that they are doing the right thing, but that is not enough. EOS BOS How can they tell us that their nomination was merit-based, and if they want to pursue that line, why do they not release the names of the finalists to the other parties? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the issue of the Lobbying Commissioner and the Official Languages Commissioner, we actually consulted opposition parties last June to see what criteria they were looking for, what their perspective was, and what stakeholders we should be consulting with. EOS BOS We have engaged them in a robust process that will determine, and end up with, the right kinds of officers of Parliament. EOS BOS Once again, if they do not have confidence in the officers of Parliament we have put forward, let them stand up and say so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, asking us to put forward a few names back in June is not consultation. EOS BOS It is not the commissioner that we do not trust; it is the government's process. EOS BOS [Translation] EOS BOS Why is that? EOS BOS Because the selection committee for the new Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner had five members, including the chief of staff of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, the chief of staff of the President of the Treasury Board, and two assistant secretaries of the Liberal cabinet. EOS BOS How can we have any faith that the selection process for the future commissioner was open, transparent, merit-based, and especially impartial, when the selection committee was dominated by Liberal cabinet employees? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to say that I completely disagree with my hon. EOS BOS colleague across the way. EOS BOS The reality is that seeking suggestions and names for months is part of the consultation process. EOS BOS Asking opposition members for criteria, possible implications, and concerns is precisely how we were able to choose the right officers of Parliament. EOS BOS That is precisely the process we followed, and we will have excellent officers of Parliament as a result. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the new Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has just barely been nominated and he is already in hot water. EOS BOS First, we learned that the work that he did on two case files when he held a similar position in the past was criticized, but even more importantly, he is refusing to confirm whether he will pursue the investigations into the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister himself that are currently under way. EOS BOS I thought we usually hired an investigator to get to the bottom of a crime, not to cover the offender's tracks. EOS BOS Is wiping the slate clean and starting fresh the Liberals' new way of dealing with crises? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand that everything is always about partisanship for the members of the opposition. EOS BOS However, we expect any conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and any officer of Parliament to fulfill their duties with care and integrity. EOS BOS We have immense respect for the approach of relying on evidence and examining all the facts before making a decision. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, during question period, the Minister of International Trade mentioned, and we have already had to correct the Prime Minister on this, that the NDP never supported any trade deal. EOS BOS He will know that we supported the Jordan trade deal— EOS </s> BOS That is a matter of debate, not a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in answer to my question, the minister mentioned a Mr. Figueroa. EOS BOS My question was about the Zamudio family. EOS </s> BOS I suggest that he ask the question maybe at a different time. EOS BOS It is not a point of order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Justice is rising on what I hope is a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I believe it is a point of order. EOS BOS There were several allegations levelled against me about the use of government aircraft. EOS BOS It is public record that I have never used government aircraft for any— EOS </s> BOS The minister is free to answer any question in the House during question period and he can certainly table information, but that did not sound like a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, jihadi terrorists have declared war on us. EOS BOS They have specifically targeted Canada and have urged their supporters to attack disbelieving Canadians “in any manner”.There is no greater responsibility for any government than the protection of its citizens, especially from those who would do us or our families harm. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs please update the House on the government's plan to further confront and degrade the terrorist group ISIL? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course ISIL has declared war on Canada. EOS BOS No reasonable person or political party would dispute this, which takes us to the position of the NDP. EOS BOS It has said that the fact that ISIL has declared war on Canada is “preposterous”. EOS BOS The only thing preposterous is the NDP continuing to deny the obvious truth that ISIL is a serious threat that requires a serious response. EOS BOS This is why we will not sit on the sidelines and why we will soon table a motion to extend and expand Canada's mission against these terrorists. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Earth Day is a good day to review the Conservatives' environmental record. EOS BOS They withdrew from the Kyoto protocol, they eliminated environmental assessments, they called into question the science of climate change and they withdrew protection for our lakes and rivers. EOS BOS Honestly, Canadians have nothing to celebrate today. EOS BOS The Minister of the Environment recently said that he is not against carbon pricing. EOS BOS When will the government introduce a carbon pricing policy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Earth Day is a wonderfully appropriate time for the opposition to reflect on the significant investments in budget 2013 in Canada's environmental priorities. EOS BOS We have invested a quarter of a billion dollars in building up the Canadian weather service. EOS BOS We are investing in conservation of ecologically sensitive lands and fish habitat. EOS BOS There is renewed funding for Sustainable Development Technology Canada and new investments and tax support for clean energy generation. EOS BOS I would suggest that the NDP reflect on all of this good news and more and then vote for our budget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he does not want to answer the question because he does not actually know the answer. EOS BOS I know that the concept of sustainability is a little hard for the minister, so let us try again. EOS BOS Being a world leader in pulling out of climate agreements is not sustainability, dismantling environmental reviews is not sustainability, and leaving future generations to pay for today's environmental degradation is not sustainability. EOS BOS When will the minister stop stalling and finally introduce effective regulations for our oil and gas sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government, as the opposition should know, is committed to developing Canada's abundant natural resources while at the same time strengthening environmental protections. EOS BOS Earlier today, I had the pleasure, along with Alberta's minister of the environment, to announce federal and provincial environmental monitoring data of air, water, and biodiversity on an Internet portal. EOS BOS This joint plan represents a scientific undertaking that is unprecedented in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Trans Mountain expansion project is in jeopardy because of backroom deals in British Columbia. EOS BOS Forces are uniting to kill this project and the thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people that come with it. EOS BOS The Prime Minister personally approved this pipeline. EOS BOS He said that it was a fundamental responsibility to get Canadian energy to market. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister finally stand up to the forces that are seeking to kill these jobs, or will he fold like a cardboard cut-out? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister said just this morning, the decision we took on the Trans Mountain pipeline was based on facts and evidence and on what is in the best interests of Canadians. EOS BOS Regardless of a change in government in British Columbia, or anywhere, the facts and evidence do not change. EOS BOS We understand that growing a strong economy for the future requires taking leadership on the environment, and we have to do those two things together. EOS BOS That is what drives us in the choices we make, and we stand by those choices. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, northern gateway was approved because of evidence and science, and he killed that because of political opposition. EOS BOS The Prime Minister claims that the approval of Trans Mountain's expansion was based on science. EOS BOS We know it will be good for the country. EOS BOS It will be good for British Columbia and Alberta workers, but he has already killed the thousands of jobs that came with northern gateway because he caved to political opposition. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister stand up to the “forces of no” and get shovels in the ground and people working, or is this project doomed to the same fate as his political rejection of the northern gateway project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the review around the Trans Mountain expansion was the most exhaustive in the history of pipelines in Canada. EOS BOS There are 157 recommendations from the National Energy Board. EOS BOS We set up our own ministerial panel, and it went up and down the line. EOS BOS The consensus, after all of that conversation with Canadians, was that it is in the national interest to build that pipeline. EOS BOS Therefore, we gave it approval, and that approval stands. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the minister said that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal was not a court of law. EOS BOS As the main estimates tabled yesterday confirm, the government has yet to uphold the tribunal's ruling. EOS BOS The government is still refusing to comply with the ruling to end discrimination against indigenous children. EOS BOS If the government thinks it has no legal obligation toward the tribunal's ruling, then what does that mean for all the cases currently before the tribunal and for Canada's Constitution? EOS BOS What happened to the honour of the crown with this Liberal government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think it goes without saying that we remain committed to achieving real reform that helps move children in first nations in this country forward. EOS BOS We have immediately accepted the ruling of the tribunal, and our government realized very quickly the need to overhaul the child welfare system in this country. EOS BOS We have started that process. EOS BOS We remain committed to that process, and we are investing to ensure that real reform occurs for children in first nations, who deserve to get better treatment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to equipping our troops, the Liberals are deliberately misleading Canadians. The budget says, “funding that is not yet allocated to specific projects...can be moved forward to future years”, but the Liberals are making a $3.7 billion cut to the defence budget. EOS BOS They are taking hundreds of millions of dollars from important military projects that are already under way. EOS BOS Who is misleading Canadians? EOS BOS is it the Minister of Finance or is it the Minister of National Defence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is another day and it is another Conservative question on procurement. EOS BOS The Conservatives showed no leadership on the procurement file. EOS BOS In fact, ironically, they now show a love for the parliamentary budget officer. I remind them of the report with respect to the F-35, and wonder whether they still appreciate the views of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on March 24, during question period, the Minister of National Defence said that the budget for procurement of equipment would be available if major acquisitions were needed. EOS BOS We now know that his statement was false. EOS BOS Hundreds of millions of dollars are being taken from projects to modernize our frigates, replace fighter planes, and improve our search and rescue capabilities. EOS BOS Will the minister apologize for misleading Canadians and restore the funding this year? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, major funding has been set aside for future years in order to address the continuous mismatch left behind by the previous government. EOS BOS We are trying to match the fiscal cycle and the procurement cycle. EOS BOS Accordingly, as procurement comes forward, our funds will match those procurements. EOS BOS There has been no cutback in the procurement funding. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is the opposite commitment to what we were searching for. EOS BOS At least we can be confident that the associate minister will not be joyriding in an F-35 any time soon. EOS BOS Not only is production continuously delayed, but its very future is in doubt. EOS BOS Britain is the most recent country to decide to delay its decision to purchase the F-35. EOS BOS Instead of hitching rides in helicopters, will the minister do his job and follow Britain, Australia and even the U.S. in putting together a backup plan for this backward program. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that the member persists with the same old rhetoric. EOS BOS Our Royal Canadian Air Force has flown CF-18s for some 30 years. EOS BOS We are now working with our allies, including Britain, to develop the aircraft that will replace them. EOS BOS Britain faces an extremely difficult time right now. EOS BOS We are monitoring the events. EOS BOS We will continue to closely monitor the developments. EOS BOS We remain committed to the program. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, hearing about the F-35s is like listening to a broken record. EOS BOS Every day, we wake up and it is the same thing. EOS BOS We learn that another one of our allies is having doubts about the F-35s. EOS BOS And every day, this government does exactly the same thing: nothing at all. EOS BOS The Americans are not going along with this. EOS BOS They are moving forward with a plan B. Will the minister abandon his script, stop reliving the same day again and again, and finally tell us what his plan B is? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are continuing to monitor. I have said all of these things before. EOS BOS The one thing that should be stated categorically in the House is by the NDP, that they do not support our military, that they do not support our men and women, that they do not support our airmen and women. EOS BOS That is really the theme here. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the cash for access scandal, the Liberals have somehow conveniently managed to miss the entire point. EOS BOS They keep polishing that turd, but it is still a turd somehow. EOS BOS The same special access to the Prime Minister and his cabinet— EOS </s> BOS Order. I encourage members to be cautious and appropriate in the language they use in this House. EOS BOS I know the hon. EOS BOS member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley would agree. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I call them like I see them.
              Special access to the—
              
                Some hon. members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we sometimes cannot hear everything a member has to say. EOS BOS Last fall, after being caught red-handed, the Liberals decided to press pause on their cash for access fundraisers, but as we might have guessed, they decided to press play again. EOS BOS This evening, the Prime Minister will be in Montreal rubbing shoulders with some of the Liberal Party's generous donors. EOS BOS The Liberals seem to think that no one will notice, however. EOS BOS It is though they are trying to play a Jedi mind trick on us by waving their hand and saying, “ EOS BOS This is not a cash for access fundraiser”. EOS BOS Honestly, do the Liberals not realize that Canadians can see right through them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is taking real action to be more open and transparent with Canadians. EOS BOS That is why my new mandate involves introducing a bill to make political fundraising more open and transparent. EOS BOS If that bill passes, it will apply to events attended by the Prime Minister, ministers, party leaders, and party leadership candidates. EOS BOS It is always possible to raise the bar, and we will continue to take action to make the government more transparent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said he would lower taxes for the middle class, but he actually raised taxes on public transit, children's sports and arts activities, camping, and even beer and wine. EOS BOS In fact, 80% of middle-class Canadians are paying more taxes, and the wealthiest Canadians are paying $1 billion less. EOS BOS The only word to describe this is incompetence. EOS BOS When is the Prime Minister going to stop making life easier for his rich friends and harder for everyone else? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, Conservatives are demonstrating that they do not understand how to help Canadians. EOS BOS The statistics he is referring to do not take into account the Canada child benefit. EOS BOS This benefit gives more money to nine out of 10 families. EOS BOS It has lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and is helping Canadian families immensely. EOS BOS It is one of the elements that led to the economic growth we are seeing now. EOS BOS The Conservatives would have preferred to keep their own benefit, which gave money to millionaires every month. EOS BOS We are giving money to families who actually need it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is rich millionaire friends who are getting the benefits of the government's policy. EOS BOS However, the incompetence extends to so many other areas. EOS BOS It has been two years, and the Prime Minister has broken two key promises of his campaign. EOS BOS First, he said he would run modest deficits. EOS BOS Now we know that his out of control spending is costing taxpayers over $100 billion. EOS BOS Second, he said he would balance the budget in 2019. EOS BOS Now his government is telling us it does not even know when the budget will be balanced. EOS BOS The Prime Minister cannot even read a balance sheet. EOS BOS How can Canadians have any confidence in anything else he is doing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in order to chase their goal of balancing the budget at all costs, they created the Phoenix fiasco, they nickel and dimed our veterans, and they continued to cut services for Canadians across the board. EOS BOS We made a different decision than they did. EOS BOS We told Canadians that we would run deficits, so we could grow the economy and put more money in the pockets of Canadians who needed it. EOS BOS That is exactly what we have done, and that is working for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one would hope that the procurement minister would know what a mid-shore patrol ship is. EOS BOS However, warranty work on the patrol ships is not the only file the part-time minister cannot deal with. EOS BOS Canada's Atlantic salmon are in jeopardy, and the minister finds himself in another conflict. EOS BOS The Irvings are involved in the Atlantic Salmon Federation, and the minister's advisory panel on the Atlantic salmon. EOS BOS Will the minister act on the recommendations to protect Atlantic salmon? EOS BOS Wait, I forgot, he cannot he deal with that file either. EOS BOS Maybe someone else on that side could stand up and deal with it. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I hope the record will show the excitement of my friends in front of us, on the other side of the House, that I am answering an important question about Atlantic salmon. EOS BOS Our government is committed to the conservation and protection of Atlantic salmon. EOS BOS We understand the importance of this industry, not only to Canadians but to people around the world who come to visit our pristine rivers in provinces like mine. EOS BOS We will always work in the best interest of preserving and protecting Atlantic salmon and its habitat. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission was established in 1955 by Canada and the U.S. EOS BOS It was established on a fixed cost-sharing basis. EOS BOS The United States has consistently increased annual funding to the commission. EOS BOS In budget 2016, the Liberals failed to support the important work of the commission, which includes protecting our Great Lakes from invasive species such as Asian carp and sea lamprey. EOS BOS Will the fisheries minister please take action to ensure that Canada pays its share to protect our Great Lakes fisheries, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the short answer is, yes. EOS BOS I know the member is rightfully concerned by the persistent problem of invasive species. EOS BOS He has identified the Great Lakes as an area of considerable concern. EOS BOS I am really excited, because my colleague, the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, will have some very important and significant news on this exact issue, probably in the next 48 hours. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I wait in anticipation, but the truth is that more than ever we need the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to have the tools it needs to protect our Great Lakes fisheries. EOS BOS Just recently, a commercial fisherman in Quebec reeled in a 29 kilogram Asian carp from the St. Lawrence River. EOS BOS The results will be devastating if an Asian carp population enters the Great Lakes in great numbers, or in any numbers in fact. EOS BOS Why have the Liberals failed to protect an $8.3 billion recreational fishery in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it will not surprise members that I do not share the pessimistic view of my colleague in the opposition. EOS BOS I have said that we are committed to working both with provincial partners and the Americans on the important challenge of invasive species. EOS BOS We are working particularly with staff members in the province of Quebec on the shared experience they have in response to this important issue in respect to the capture of carp in the St. Lawrence near Montreal. EOS BOS This is why I know that the anticipation is very exciting for my colleague, but he should remain calm. EOS BOS We have very good news coming. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, tonight we will vote on the respect for communities act, which would give residents, law enforcement, and community leaders a say when safe drug injection sites want to open in their areas. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the Liberals have voted against giving communities this say, while the Liberal leader wants to open more injection sites across the country. EOS BOS We all know that drug injection houses allow the use of dangerous and addictive drugs. EOS BOS We also know that drugs promote family breakup. EOS BOS They tear families apart, promote criminal behaviour, and ruin lives. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Health please update the House on the latest developments on this important legislation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member is right in saying that these dangerous and addictive drugs do tear families apart. EOS BOS They promote criminal behaviour and they destroy communities. EOS BOS The Liberal leader's pledge to blindly open drug injection houses in neighbourhoods is not only disturbing, it is risky for the health of Canadians. EOS BOS As Minister of Health, I will make sure that communities have a say when injection sites want to open, and we will, of course, most importantly, continue to support treatment and recovery programs that work to get those who are addicted to drugs off drugs, and help them lead recovered and drug-free lives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us try to sum up the Liberal ethical violations of just this past year. EOS BOS The Prime Minister breaks the law by taking a private helicopter to a billionaire's island, but who has not done that too? EOS BOS The finance minister secretly holds on to millions of dollars in shares in a numbered company, but I say, “ EOS BOS Let ye cast the first stone”. EOS BOS Now the Liberal House leader, whose job it has been to defend the ethical violations of the finance minister and the Prime Minister, was put in charge of hiring a new ethics commissioner. EOS BOS Irony is dead over there. EOS BOS My question for the Prime Minister is this. EOS BOS Exactly how many ethical violations and investigations is it going to take before the Liberals realize that the rules apply to them too? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we come to the end of this year, one cannot help but feel bad for the members of the opposition, because of the results we have gotten as a government. EOS BOS The job creation numbers, 441,000 new jobs, the best in 18 years; the growing economy; the help for the middle class; and the positive outcomes leave the opposition with nothing to do but to fling accusations and throw mud. EOS BOS That is not what Canadians want. EOS BOS That is not what Canadians deserve. EOS BOS I hope they will be getting better than that in the coming year. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, General Jonathan Vance said the battle against ISIS has no end in sight. EOS BOS He went on to say Canadians should prepare for more Canadian Armed Forces casualties with the expansion of the mission on the ground in Iraq. EOS BOS Our troops are facing increased risk, and because of the Liberals, they do not have Canadian air support. EOS BOS Will the Minister of National Defence admit that prematurely pulling out our CF-18s was a mistake? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his concern for the well-being of our troops. EOS BOS I can assure the member that our troops in Iraq have full air support when needed. EOS BOS In fact, we have done a thorough assessment. EOS BOS I talk to the chief of the defence staff on a regular basis about the security situation, and we have taken all the measures necessary and have given freedom of actions to take any future necessary precautions for the protection of our troops. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals refuse to say that we are at war with ISIS, but according to the chief of the defence staff, the risk to the lives of our troops on the ground in Iraq has gone up. EOS BOS How can Canadian casualties increase if we are not at war?Will the defence minister join our allies and finally say that Canada is at war against the jihadi genocidal death cult called ISIS? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member can keep talking in terms of the definitions of war, but our fight against ISIL does not change in any way. EOS BOS We will take every action with our coalition partners to defeat Daesh, and we are not going to give ISIL legitimacy by calling them a state, by calling this a war. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this Prime Minister has dictated that the provinces must collect his carbon tax. EOS BOS In true Liberal fashion, Premier Wynne has secretly planned to apply HST to their new cap-and-trade plan and will hide the cap-and-trade tax in the delivery charge. EOS BOS Ontarians are not only paying more for heat and hydro but now will be paying tax on tax. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister stand up for his Ontarians and tell his Ontario Liberal friends to start helping the middle class instead of taxing them to death? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, 80% of Canadians live in a jurisdiction where there is already a price on pollution. EOS BOS The good news is that provinces stepped up when the previous government did not. EOS BOS We know that putting a price on what we do not want, pollution, will foster what we do want, which is good jobs, a cleaner economy, and innovation. EOS BOS We are proud of what we are doing, and we are going to continue moving forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, ever since this government came to power, there has been no end to the tax measures that hurt middle-class families. EOS BOS They are forced to pay more taxes and all sorts of exorbitant fees, and we still do not know whether dental care will be taxed as well. EOS BOS Sometimes I wonder whether the Liberal slogan should be, “ EOS BOS I tax, therefore I am”. EOS BOS Do Canadians need to pay $1,500 to the Minister of Finance to get him to listen to them and agree to reduce their tax burden? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, fortunately for the middle class, we have already lowered their taxes. EOS BOS That is the first thing we did. EOS BOS Thanks to this reduction, a single person will pay $330 less in taxes, and a family will pay $540 less. EOS BOS Those are the facts. EOS BOS We also brought in the Canada child benefit, which will give nine in 10 families an extra $2,300 tax-free. EOS BOS This is good for the middle class and Canadian families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec and its 60,000 businesses are asking the government to do something about the unfair tax treatment that penalizes those who sell their businesses to family members rather than strangers. EOS BOS Our business people are sick and tired of Ottawa making life difficult for small and medium-sized Quebec businesses. EOS BOS Quebec has already solved this problem. EOS BOS If Quebec were independent, this problem would no longer exist. EOS BOS My question is as follows: will any of the 40 government members stand up to fix this problem for our business people? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that it is very important to have a tax system that works. EOS BOS We think that now, our system works for the people of Quebec and the whole country. EOS BOS We will review the tax system over the coming year, as announced in budget 2016. EOS BOS The review will give us an opportunity to consider measures that are important for Canada's system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning, the House Leader of the Official Opposition moved a motion to remove the provisions concerning veterans from the budget implementation bill and to immediately pass them at all stages. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the Liberals did not support that motion, so I would like to give them another chance to do so. EOS BOS I therefore ask the House for unanimous consent for the following motion. “ EOS BOS That, notwithstanding any Standing or Special Order or usual practice of the House, Bill C-15, An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 22, 2016 and other measures, be divided into two Bills, namely, Bills C-15A and C-15B, as follows: (I) Bill C-15A shall contain all the provisions of the Bill respecting the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-establishment and Compensation Act to, among other things, (a) replace “permanent impairment allowance” with “career impact allowance”; (b) replace “totally and permanently incapacitated” with “ EOS BOS diminished earning capacity”; (c) increase the percentage in the formula used to calculate the earnings loss benefit; (d) specify when a disability award becomes payable and clarify the formula used to calculate the amount of a disability award; (e) increase the amounts of a disability award; and (f) increase the amount of a death benefit; and All the provisions that provide, among other things, that the Minister of Veterans Affairs must pay, to a person who received a disability award or a death benefit under that Act before April 1, 2017, an amount that represents the increase in the amount of the disability award or the death benefit, as the case may be, and the consequential amendments to the Children of Deceased Veterans Education Assistance Act, the Pension Act and the Income Tax Act; (II) Bill C-15B shall contain all the remaining provisions of Bill C-15 and retain the status on the Order Paper that it had prior to the adoption of this Order; and That Bill C-15A be deemed read a second time and referred to a Committee of the Whole, deemed considered in Committee of the Whole—” EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS Apparently the hon. member does not have the unanimous consent of the House EOS BOS . EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has said that the fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador is broken. EOS BOS Well, with the stroke of a pen he can help fix it. EOS BOS Sitting on his desk, waiting for his signature, are permits needed to fish sea cucumber for the Asian market. EOS BOS Studies done by his department show that there is a healthy sea cucumber supply that can sustain a viable fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador. EOS BOS Will the minister stop procrastinating, sign these permits and agree to a commercial sea cucumber fishery for Newfoundland and Labrador? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to assure my colleague that Fisheries and Oceans Canada does support the emergence of a sustainable commercial sea cucumber fishery. Sustainability of the resource will be the primary consideration as we move forward on this. EOS BOS Economic prosperity, as well as current and potential markets, will also be considered. EOS BOS The department is committed to undertaking allocation decisions related to the new emerging fisheries policy. EOS BOS That is the direction in which we are going. EOS BOS We are taking this very carefully. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the election, millions of Canadians voted “no” to the Conservatives' plan to dismantle the CBC.Our public broadcaster was under attack by the Conservatives for 10 years, so it is about time that we breathed some life into the CBC. EOS BOS The Liberals made some promises and they need to keep them. EOS BOS The Minister of Canadian Heritage has so far refused to confirm any specific funding, and yet their election commitment was very clear. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS Is the government going to invest $150 million in the CBC, as promised during the election campaign? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for his question. EOS BOS We were elected on a platform that called for ambitious reinvestment in arts and culture. EOS BOS We received a clear mandate from Canadians: to deliver on that platform. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not an answer. EOS BOS A promise isn't something you can just say to get yourself elected. EOS BOS Canadians expect the current Liberal government to keep its promises. EOS BOS Page 56 of the Liberal platform promises to “reverse [the previous Conservative prime minister's] cuts and invest $150 million in new annual funding”. EOS BOS CBC is the cultural spine of this nation, the very essence of Canadian identity. EOS BOS Will the Canadian government keep its promise on the CBC? EOS BOS Just one word, yes or no. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we strongly believe in the importance of a public broadcaster and a public content creator in this 21st century. EOS BOS This is why we will reinvest in CBC/Radio Canada. EOS BOS That is a platform commitment and we will abide by it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been a year since the government started the Phoenix pay fiasco. EOS BOS For months, over 360 employees at Saskatchewan's federal penitentiary went without proper pay. EOS BOS To protect Canadians, we must ensure that guards who are overseeing maximum security prisoners are not distracted by ongoing payroll problems. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Public Safety, who is also from Saskatchewan, ask the Minister of Public Services to finally fix the Phoenix pay system once and for all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, in Saskatchewan, as elsewhere, resolving the problems that we inherited from the other side in terms of the public service pay problems is our priority. EOS BOS We are obviously working tirelessly with—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS I am having a hard time hearing. EOS BOS Maybe members can keep it down. EOS BOS I am sure they have comments, but maybe they could keep them among themselves, and then we can hear the answer. EOS BOS The hon. parliamentary secretary. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are obviously working tirelessly with public servants, their representatives and unions, and other government departments to find and implement solutions to problems as they arise. EOS BOS We are taking measures, such as implementing emergency pay advances, opening temporary satellite offices, and recruiting more than 200 additional compensation advisers, many, of course, who were let go prematurely by the former government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with development assistance budgets withering and the minister turning his back on CIDA's long-standing partners in favour of private corporations, there are many questions about the Minister of International Cooperation's mandate. EOS BOS Will the new law the government has promised materialize in the form of a specific bill? EOS BOS Will civil society partners and experts be consulted? EOS BOS Will parliamentarians have an opportunity to debate this in depth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that premise is absolutely ludicrous. EOS BOS Canadian taxpayer money is not a gift. EOS BOS It is used for very reasonable and justifiable purposes. EOS BOS We are a compassionate country. EOS BOS We are results driven. EOS BOS We are directing Canadian taxpayer dollars where they can have the greatest impact for those most in need. EOS BOS It is not about shovelling money out the door; it is about ensuring Canadian taxpayer money is used properly and for legitimate reasons. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at a moment when the number of refugees worldwide has never been so high, the number of refugee claimants in Canada has reached record lows. EOS BOS We have gone from 40,000 claimants in 2000 to 13,000 in 2013. EOS BOS The results are clear. EOS BOS The Conservatives are systematically destroying Canada's proud history of welcoming those in need. EOS BOS No matter how much Conservatives ignore it, caring for one another remains a core Canadian value. EOS BOS Is the minister really proud of his government's failure to sustain Canada's history of refugee settlement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we do have a proud history of refugee resettlement, and it never included accepting large numbers of refugee claims from the European Union, from other democracies, and from countries that have the rule of law. EOS BOS That was what was starting to happen, up until recent years, under the broken Liberal system we inherited in 2006. EOS BOS We reformed it. EOS BOS The number of claims from safe countries is down. EOS BOS The number of claims from countries of conflict, where there is real persecution, like Iraq, Syria, and Somalia, is way up. EOS BOS That is allowing us to resettle a record number of refugees. EOS BOS Our record in this respect is second to none. EOS BOS Canada is standing up for refugees in the best tradition of our humanitarian programs. EOS
BOS Actually, Mr. Speaker, that record pales in comparison to Scandinavian countries, which accept far more refugees, with the same populations. EOS BOS This is not just a numbers game. EOS BOS It is also mean-spirited. EOS BOS Thanks to Conservative cuts, pregnant women claiming refugee status are going without prenatal care. EOS BOS Desperate parents are waiting so long to get care for their kids that children are ending up in the hospital, and sick people are going without chemotherapy and essential medications. EOS BOS That is the kind of welcome the government is giving to refugees. EOS BOS Why will the minister not show respect for basic Canadian values and restore appropriate health care for refugees? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the hon. EOS BOS member is completely wrong. EOS BOS The member countries of the European Union resettle almost no refugees. EOS BOS They do have large numbers of asylum claims these days, and we salute some of those countries for accepting asylum seekers from the troubled Middle East and other regions. EOS BOS However, the member is totally out of line when he says at this late date in the House, contradicting some of his own party colleagues, that refugees in our country are not receiving health care. EOS BOS The reverse is true. EOS BOS They receive the best health care in the world, every one of them. EOS BOS We will continue to stand up for refugees and Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how can the minister be proud of his health care reform for refugee claimants when the Federal Court ruled that this reform was cruel? EOS BOS The Conservatives would rather spend $1.4 million of taxpayers' money defending their reform in court than reinstate the health care program. EOS BOS This reform negatively affects the most vulnerable people in Canada, including pregnant women and children. EOS BOS Why is the minister insisting on moving forward with this cruel reform? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, why does the hon. EOS BOS member not join us in promoting refugee resettlement and supporting our programs to help refugees from Iraq and Syria? EOS BOS Why does she insist on insinuating that refugee claimants who are eligible for Canada's protection do not receive health care? EOS BOS They receive health care, without exception, and we are going to continue to protect their interests, the interests of refugees and the interests of Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, cuts to the health care of refugee claimants are just one of the minister’s many ways to reduce the number of vulnerable people seeking assistance here in Canada. EOS BOS The numbers do not lie. EOS BOS While our international partners are facing unprecedented migration crises, here in Canada we have gone from 40,000 refugee claims per year to about 10,000 claims per year. EOS BOS That is shameful. EOS BOS How can the minister justify these figures that are so inconsistent with the values of openness that Canadians are so proud of? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP’s position is already known. EOS BOS If we listened to the NDP, we would have given health care to failed refugee claimants, to fraudulent claimants. EOS BOS We would be providing asylum to people from safe countries, such as those in the European Union. EOS BOS We are not going to do that. EOS BOS We are going to focus on genuine refugees and the truly vulnerable, such as those coming from Iraq, Syria and war-torn countries. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing, without any support from the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in December 2016, the Prime Minister personally promised to take action to extend employment insurance sickness benefits. EOS BOS One year later, nothing has been done, clearly. EOS BOS Fifteen weeks of benefits is not enough, especially for someone struggling with serious health problems. EOS BOS Once those 15 weeks are up, the sick person is left without any income to live on. EOS BOS How is a seriously ill person supposed to pay the bills? EOS BOS It is impossible. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister finally keep his promise, stop doing consultations, and overhaul EI sickness benefits? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be part of a government that believes the employment insurance system has a role to play in providing an income to families going through hard times and to communities that are suffering. EOS BOS Since 2016, we have implemented solid measures to make the EI system more flexible and more generous. EOS BOS We are going to continue this work, because we strongly believe that we are just getting started. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, senior civil servants are warning the Conservatives not to strip environmental requirements from infrastructure budgets. Scrapping these criteria EOS BOS would be short sighted. EOS BOS Green infrastructure saves us billions in the long run by ensuring our communities can adapt to growing extreme weather events and climate change, but cabinet seems to be considering scrapping it. EOS BOS Will the minister commit to retaining green infrastructure criteria in the upcoming federal budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is already in the building Canada plan. EOS BOS A wide area of waste water, waste management, and disaster mitigation projects are eligible under the new building Canada fund and the gas tax fund. EOS BOS Green infrastructure is also a specific category under the new building Canada fund. EOS BOS It is up to the provinces and municipalities to prioritize the projects they want. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister did not answer the question. EOS BOS The Prime Minister reneged on Canada's signature and withdrew from the Kyoto protocol. EOS BOS For 10 years this government has gutted our environmental laws. EOS BOS Senior officials are now sounding the alarm because infrastructure projects would no longer be subject to environmental criteria, which help cities adapt to the effects of climate change. EOS BOS Will the minister be clear and unequivocally promise to keep these environmental criteria? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were pleased to introduce the largest and most substantial infrastructure plan in Canada's history. EOS BOS It is unprecedented. EOS BOS The criteria can be found on the Infrastructure Canada site. EOS BOS Of course, the Liberals did nothing when they were in power. EOS BOS They would like to try again, but we will be back EOS BOS . We will continue to invest in infrastructure. EOS BOS We will continue to work very hard. EOS BOS The criteria are available on the Infrastructure Canada site. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged the public to turn their backs on Pegida: So I say to all those who go to such demonstrations: do not follow those who have called the rallies. EOS BOS Because all too often they have prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts. EOS BOS Next Saturday, Pegida Quebec, the first chapter of the movement in North America, is holding a rally in Montreal's Little Maghreb. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister echo Angela Merkel and unequivocally urge the people of Quebec not to take part in this rally? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously we have important values and principles in Canada EOS BOS . Respecting rights and freedoms and gender equality are important principles. EOS BOS Although people are free to take part in demonstrations, we encourage them to abide by the rules of democracy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Minister of Environment introduced a bill on the environment and sustainable development. EOS BOS The Liberals made all kinds of promises to environmental groups to get elected, and now, after 28 months in power, this Liberal government has given birth to a mouse. EOS BOS This bill is nothing but window dressing. EOS BOS It sets deadlines and requests scientific studies, but at the end of the day the minister has all the decision-making power. EOS BOS Can we balance sustainable development with economic development? EOS BOS Why this charade? EOS BOS Can we put effective measures in place to protect our resources and develop them intelligently? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the hon. member across the way that we have protections. EOS BOS We know that in the 21st century we must do better. EOS BOS While the previous government attacked environmental programs and protections for our fish and navigable waters, we rebuilt them. EOS BOS We are off to a much better start because we are restoring Canadians' trust in our system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals' proposed changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will saddle job-creating resource development projects with unnecessary red tape, bureaucratic hurdles, political interference, and complex processes before these projects can proceed. EOS BOS In fact, the proof is in the pudding. EOS BOS There was a headline last week, “Suncor to shun major new projects amid Canada's 'difficult' regulatory environment”. EOS BOS The Liberals fail to understand that energy projects in Canada are designed with the best environmental standards. EOS BOS Why is the Liberal government continuing to jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Canadians and hundreds of communities that rely on our natural resources? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reason that we have brought forward new legislation is to rebuild trust in our environmental assessment process. EOS BOS If we do not have the trust of Canadians, if we are not making decisions based on science, if we are not listening to indigenous peoples, then we are not going to get good projects built. EOS BOS The proof is in the pudding with the party opposite. EOS BOS It could not get projects built. EOS BOS We have a system that rebuilds trust, that has tighter timelines, and is going to make sure that we protect our environment while ensuring good projects go ahead. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the House yesterday, the hon. Minister of Natural Resources said, first of all, that he disagrees with the decision to impose unfair and punitive tariffs on softwood lumber; second, that he has created a federal-provincial task force, and I want to emphasize this, to support the forestry industry; and third, that he supports forestry workers. EOS BOS That is all great. EOS BOS In that case, why is his government being so inconsistent and refusing what, first of all, Quebec, second, the forestry industy, and third, the forestry workers themselves are asking for in terms of support, that is, loan guarantees? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for accurately portraying our position. EOS BOS We are working with all those across the country who have an interest in this file. EOS BOS Together we are focusing in on the short-term realities of the possibility of layoffs and job losses in Quebec and elsewhere. EOS BOS We are talking about transition in the industry. EOS BOS We are talking about the expansion of export markets. EOS BOS We are taking it seriously, across the country, to do whatever we possibly can to soften the blow of these punitive and unwelcome tariffs. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, interfering in provincial jurisdictions is thoroughly ingrained in the Liberal culture. EOS BOS This centralist government wants to impose conditions on health care and the money transferred to the provinces for Canadians' well-being. EOS BOS Does the Minister of Health know what it means to respect provincial jurisdictions? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, Canadians are proud of their public health care system. EOS BOS I understand the concerns, and I would like to point out that the Canada health transfer is going to increase by over $1 billion next year, bringing it up to more than $37 billion. I have already had discussions with my counterpart in Quebec, as well as the other provincial and territorial ministers. EOS BOS We will continue our discussions on how to create a health care system that meets Canadians' needs. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the provinces are in the best position to spend health care dollars. EOS BOS We on this side of the House understand that. EOS BOS Today I am calling on the Minister of Health to remove all conditions on the transfer of funding intended for Canadians' health care. EOS BOS The minister needs to mind her own business and respect provincial jurisdictions for the well-being of Canadians. EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I find it fascinating that the members opposite who, while they were in power for almost a decade, did nothing to advance health care in this country are now dictating how it should be done. EOS BOS Our government works with a spirit of collaboration with our partners. EOS BOS All levels of government have a role to play in health care. EOS BOS It requires us to work in collaboration with patients, with health care providers, all of us working together for the betterment of the health of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on May 2, an internal Canada Revenue Agency email instructed officers to deny 80% of tax credit claims from diabetics. EOS BOS Last Friday, the agency announced that it would review all rejected claims. EOS BOS This is clearly an admission of guilt by the government. EOS BOS There is one thing that this government lacks, and that is honour. EOS BOS Could someone in this government rise and apologize to diabetics on behalf of their government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our objective has always been clear, to ensure that Canadians have access to the credits they are eligible to. EOS BOS With the reinstatement of the disability advisory committee, the agency will have a formal advisory process to work on improving the accessibility of its services to Canadians with disabilities. EOS BOS We are giving these groups back their seat at the table, which the Conservatives took away in 2006. EOS BOS This formal process will ensure that any future actions taken by the agency will be made in consultation with stakeholders. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there was no need for a committee to resolve a situation that was completely unacceptable. EOS BOS When we were in power, 80% of claims were approved. EOS BOS When the Liberals are in power, 80% of claims are denied. EOS BOS The Minister of National Revenue rose 23 times in the House and stated that there had been no changes in the rules. EOS BOS Last Friday, her department said the exact opposite. EOS BOS I will ask my question again. EOS BOS Is there anyone in this government who will do the honourable thing and rise to tell diabetics that the government made a mistake and is apologizing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as a registered nurse, I know how important it is to vulnerable groups to have their voices heard. EOS BOS With the announcement of the disability advisory committee last week, we will make sure of how the agency administers its credits and benefits for people with disabilities. EOS BOS Following concerns raised by Canadians, the agency is evaluating applications to determine whether or not there has been an impact on the delivery of the DTC. EOS BOS We will continue to take steps to improve the agency's services to all Canadians, particularly the most vulnerable in our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after two months of questions by the opposition and pressure from Diabetes Canada, the Liberals have finally said they will revert to their pre-May 2 policy. EOS BOS The strange thing is that even while the minister reverses her policy, she continues to deny she ever made a change in the first place. EOS BOS Will the minister finally admit that she made a choice to deny the credit she is now trying to cover her tracks in regard to, and will she apologize to type 1 diabetics? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committing to ensuring that all Canadians who are eligible for credits and benefits have access to them. EOS BOS Following concerns raised by Canadians, the agency is evaluating applications to determine whether or not there has been an impact on the delivery of the DTC. EOS BOS Through the disability advisory committee, disability advocates, medical professionals, indigenous advocates, and other important stakeholders will now be consulted on how the agency can improve its services to Canadians with disabilities. EOS BOS Unlike the previous government, we want these groups at the table. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the meeting with stakeholders on November 30, the minister insisted there was no evidence that there had been any change to the disability tax credit. EOS BOS During that same meeting, type 1 diabetics produced the evidence. EOS BOS They showed her documents that proved that the eligibility criteria had changed. EOS BOS This minister's treatment of diabetics has been terrible. EOS BOS Will she finally quit fighting type 1 diabetics and apologize for her appalling conduct? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, let me be absolutely clear that the law and the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit have not changed EOS BOS . 
              We will continue to improve the accessibility of this credit to Canadians and have already taken extremely important actions. EOS BOS We have simplified the application form. EOS BOS We have allowed more nurse practitioners to certify those patients' applications, and with the reinstatement of the disability advisory committee, we are bringing stakeholders back to the table to better determine how we can improve access even more. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, documents reveal that the Minister of Status of Women spent more money renovating her offices than on supporting shelters for abused women. EOS BOS While the minister was spending over $1 million on her luxury accommodations, she spent less than $700,000 on emergency housing for battered women. EOS BOS How can the minister justify this blatant misuse taxpayer funds while every night women in need are being turned away from emergency shelters across Canada because of the lack of funding? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to rise on this traditional territory and to acknowledge that the work of this feminist government is making a real impact in the lives of women and girls across the country, with $100 million invested in a gender-based violence strategy, $11 billion invested in housing, a poverty reduction strategy, investments in supporting women entrepreneurs, investments in women in STEM, $90 million in a network of shelters across the country, $7 billion in child care, flexibility and more choice in EI and caregiving benefits, I could go on. EOS BOS I hope the member opposite asks me again. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' lack of honesty is such that they are announcing more infrastructure money for municipalities, but will reduce these funds by 90% on the first of April. EOS BOS We have to make investments in order to grow our economy so that the middle class can benefit. EOS BOS Instead of investing, the government is making cuts and pretending to invest. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives believe that cutting infrastructure spending will help the economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would have two messages for the Liberal Party. EOS BOS The first is that contrary to the Liberals' belief, budgets do not balance themselves. EOS BOS The second is that contrary to their beliefs, money does not grow on trees. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we will balance the budget by 2015, and we are making record investments in infrastructure with stable and predictable funding over the next decade. EOS BOS That is leadership. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is predictable all right; it is down 90%. EOS BOS When a government is responsible for the weakest economic growth since R.B. Bennett, maybe the member will agree that the Conservatives clearly are doing something wrong. EOS BOS The only solution they can think of is to cut infrastructure spending by 90%. EOS BOS That is not what they promised Canadians. EOS BOS Instead of planning to help our economy grow so that all Canadians, especially the middle class, can benefit, the Conservatives hide their cut as a future broken promise for money they will never actually spend. EOS BOS Why is the government more interested in creative accounting than investing in infrastructure to support the Canadian economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that the buttons on that member's calculator are not working properly. EOS BOS In our budget last year, we announced the longest and the largest infrastructure plan in Canada's history. EOS BOS Since we became government, we have tripled investments in infrastructure. EOS BOS The Federation of Canadian Municipalities welcomes our investments over the next decade. EOS BOS It welcomes the fact that over 70% of the funds will be dedicated to municipal infrastructure priorities. EOS BOS We are getting the job done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' 10-year infrastructure plan is nothing more than a five-year cut, followed by a wishy-washy five-year guarantee for money they know very well may never get spent. EOS BOS So when household debt is at an all-time high and our economic growth is decreasing year over year, the Conservatives are only promising to increase infrastructure spending in 2019. EOS BOS It does not matter what calculator one punches that into, it is too far down the road. EOS BOS Why is the government cutting funding for infrastructure, for highways, roads, bridges, and sewer systems, which the municipalities need today? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in addition to our record investments, an important component of the new building Canada plan is the gas tax fund. EOS BOS Here is what our government has done with respect to the gas tax fund: we have extended it; we have doubled it; we have legislated it; and moving forward, we will index the gas tax fund. EOS BOS There is over $22 billion for municipal and provincial infrastructure priority needs specifically through the gas tax fund. EOS BOS These are record investments. EOS BOS The municipalities and the provinces welcome this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of arrogance that could mean that this is the Prime Minister's last question period, so I hope he does not mind that we have a couple more. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's plan is not working. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has failed. EOS BOS That is why Canadians want change. EOS BOS As families struggle to make ends meet, the Prime Minister is telling seniors they will have to wait an extra two years to retire, raising the retirement age to 67. EOS BOS The Prime Minister forgot to mention that in the last election campaign. EOS BOS Can he please tell Canadians today what he is hiding up his sleeve for the next time around? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I remind the leader of the NDP that it will be Canadians, not him, who decide the results of the next election. EOS BOS Canadians understand that we are living in a global economy that is very troubled. EOS BOS They also understand, as they look around the world, that there is absolutely no better place to be than this country, Canada. EOS BOS We have a balanced budget. EOS BOS We have lower taxes for Canadian families, businesses, and workers. EOS BOS We have more money that is going into the pockets of our senior citizens and families. EOS BOS I do not believe anyone is going to blow that by buying the high-tax snake oil of the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals tried to raise taxes on health and dental benefits, but we stopped them. EOS BOS They tried to raise taxes on people with autism and diabetes, but we stopped them. EOS BOS They are trying to raise taxes on our family farmers and local businesses, and we continue to stop them. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister admit that he is just putting these tax increases targeted at vulnerable people on hold and that he will try to bring them back in, if, God forbid, he gets another chance after the next election? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest 1%, and the Conservatives tried to stop us. EOS BOS We brought in a Canada child benefit that would give more money to nine out of 10 Canadian families and lifts hundreds of thousands of kids out of poverty, and they tried to stop us. EOS BOS We moved forward in increasing the guaranteed income supplement for our most vulnerable elderly seniors, and they tried to stop us. EOS BOS We moved forward on strengthening the CPP for future generations, and they tried to stop us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals always talk about their real record. EOS BOS Despite their promises, the wealthiest 1% in Canada are paying a billion dollars less in taxes. EOS BOS Despite their promises, the middle class, 87% of them, are paying higher taxes. EOS BOS Despite their promises, that millionaire, the Prime Minister, continues to get child care benefits in the form of taxpayer-funded nanny services. EOS BOS Their wealthiest friends continue to stash away their money in tax havens that the government has done nothing to address. EOS BOS When will the Liberals admit that it is a government by the rich, of the rich, and for the rich? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, in their pursuit of endless partisanship, the Conservatives follow think tanks that do not include the whole picture. EOS BOS The stats they are quoting now do not actually include the Canada child benefit. EOS BOS I can understand why. EOS BOS They campaigned against our Canada child benefit, which gave more money to nine out of 10 Canadian families and lifted hundreds of thousands of kids out of poverty. EOS BOS They wanted to continue with their benefits that sent child benefit cheques to millionaire families. EOS BOS I do not think that is fair. EOS BOS Canadians did not think that was fair. EOS BOS That is why we are delivering on what we committed to Canadians to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals continue to deliver child care benefits to that millionaire in the form of taxpayer-funded nannies. EOS BOS However, beyond that, the Prime Minister criticized the source I used for statistics. EOS BOS He says it is a think tank. EOS BOS Actually, it is his own finance department, which has the wealthiest 1% paying a billion dollars less under the government. EOS BOS No new taxes for his trust fund, no new taxes for Morneau Shepell, no new taxes for his fundraising chair, just more taxes for the working people who pay the bills in our country. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, one cannot help but feel bad for the Conservatives. EOS BOS They are resorting to flailing around with personal attacks because we have created over 441,000 new jobs over these past 12 months. EOS BOS That is an 18-year record for the Canadian government. EOS BOS We are delivering the fastest growth rate in the G7. EOS BOS We are delivering on low unemployment and benefits to Canadians, which are making a real and tangible difference in their lives. EOS BOS All they have left is groundless personal attacks. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I quote facts from the Prime Minister's own finance department and he considers it a terrible personal attack against him. EOS BOS Maybe he should take that up with the finance department. EOS BOS When the government gets big, we know who pays more. EOS BOS It is the working class. EOS BOS It was not Morneau Shepell that paid higher taxes. EOS BOS It has not been his fundraising chair. EOS BOS It has not been him. EOS BOS In fact, we know that the wealthiest 1% pays a billion dollars less. EOS BOS Yes, that is a record to cry about. EOS BOS The reality is that when the government gets bigger, the working class pays more. EOS BOS When are the Liberals going to put an end to that injustice? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the first thing we did was lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS This summer, when we said we were going to be lowering taxes for small businesses and making sure that wealthy Canadians would no longer be encouraged to use Canadian-controlled private corporations to pay lower tax rates than middle-class Canadians, those Conservatives went on the warpath, scared everyone across the country, and are now sheepish that we are lowering taxes on small businesses as of January 1. EOS BOS They can do nothing but give personal attacks. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week the member for Beauce said that he was fed up with the National Assembly's unanimous declarations. EOS BOS The member, who is a minister, showed a clear lack of respect for Quebec's parliament. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us whether his minister was speaking on behalf of the Conservative government? EOS BOS If he was, is the federal government's new policy to tell Quebec's government to take a hike? EOS BOS If he was not, will the Prime Minister reprimand his minister for his lack of judgment and apologize to the National Assembly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that we work with all the provinces and respect their jurisdictions. EOS BOS Reciprocity is important when it comes to jurisdictions, and we work well with our partners in the Quebec government to advance all the province's files. EOS BOS That is our objective. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians continue to have grave concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the Iranian regime's appalling human rights record, and the regime's continued support for acts of international terrorismCanada's government has spoken out against these actions of the regime. EOS BOS We have, number one, implemented over a dozen rounds of sanctions. EOS BOS Number two, we have listed Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, and number three, we have listed the Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah as terrorist entitles. EOS BOS Given Canadians' ongoing concerns regarding the Iranian regime, would the Minister of Foreign Affairs update this House as to how the government continues to bear pressure on the Iranian regime while at the same time supporting the people of Iran in their pursuit of freedom? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member. EOS BOS He has been a leading advocate for the freedom of the Iranian people, and his work on the human rights committee is to be commended. EOS BOS Just two days ago, we strengthened our actions against Iran by adding another 30 people and 82 entities to our sanction list. EOS BOS We have never had any confidence that the regime will act in good faith when it comes to the people of Iran. EOS BOS On May 10, I took part in the Global Dialogue on the Future of Iran. EOS BOS It was an opportunity to speak to those behind the regime's firewalls. EOS BOS To date, I am pleased to say that more than 360,000 users inside Iran have accessed content from the event we hosted at the Munk School at the University of Toronto. EOS BOS We stand with the courageous activists who are working for freedom in Iran. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this Monday, June 3, the landmark arms trade treaty will be open for signature. EOS BOS This treaty will help prevent the sale of conventional weapons to conflict zones and outlaw states, such as Syria. EOS BOS Canada voted in favour of the treaty at the UN, despite drawing criticism from other countries for being an obstacle to a robust treaty. EOS BOS However, the rumour is that Canada now will not sign or ratify the treaty. EOS BOS Will the government now state clearly that it will sign the arms trade treaty and stand up for those victimized by violence in conflict zones? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada already has some of the highest global standards for the export and control of munitions. EOS BOS We believe that any treaty regarding the sale of munitions helps move the international community closer to a world with leading standards. EOS BOS That is why we joined 154 countries in voting in favour of the resolution. EOS BOS We have always been very clear, though, on two points. EOS BOS We do not want to detract from legitimate sportspeople and the legitimate civilian use of firearms. EOS BOS We do not want to detract from the cultural practices of hunting and fishing in the country. EOS BOS That is why we will review the treaty closely and consult with Canadians, as we always do before we act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian ranchers produce the safest and best-quality beef in the world. EOS BOS Some people with vested interests have attacked the Canadian industry over the last number of weeks and months, and some restaurants have even stopped serving Canadian beef. EOS BOS This Canadian farm boy is not going to eat at those restaurants anymore. EOS BOS I am wondering if the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food across the way will stand and commit to supporting Canadian agriculture, and do the same. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure my hon. colleague that we support agriculture in this government. EOS BOS All Canadian beef is certified as safe under science research. EOS BOS We have the safest high-quality beef in the world. EOS BOS It is the safest food we can eat, and Canadians are safe and should eat this food. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives made deceptive phone calls to an entire province, and the Prime Minister says harassing the people of Saskatchewan like this is just fine, even though his own caucus calls them deceptive and says they were wrong to do so. EOS BOS Why will the Prime Minister not also admit this was wrong? EOS BOS Will the government support the NDP's bill to crack down on these sorts of deceptive and misleading calls? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I did want to talk about one NDP bill, because the NDP critic for democratic reform said that the electoral boundaries commissions serve in good faith and expect non-interference from political parties. EOS BOS However, the NDP actually has a bill before the House right now to overturn the work of those non-partisan electoral boundaries commissions, in the form of Bill C-396, which does not accept the work they have done in the past. EOS BOS NDP members are trying to use the power of the House and their ability to present legislation here to overturn that work. EOS BOS It is an example of exactly what NDP members do all the time: Do as we say, not as we do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I did not hear anyone here apologize to the people of Saskatchewan. EOS BOS That is because the Conservatives take them for granted, whether they live in rural areas or in cities. EOS BOS The Conservatives used the same firm in Saskatchewan that Pierre Poutine used. EOS BOS They used a shell company to hide their activities. EOS BOS Now they say there is nothing wrong with attacking an independent commission. EOS BOS We must put an end to Conservative misuse of funds. EOS BOS Will the government clarify the CRTC rules about using such calls? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that NDP members continue to pursue this with their “do as I say, not as I do” approach. EOS BOS They criticize the automated calls, yet they made exactly those automated calls, both from Burnaby— EOS BOS Douglas, with regard to the process on redistribution, and with regard to one of their caucus colleagues after she left. EOS BOS They criticize us for being involved in the redistribution process, while they have done so vigorously from their side. EOS BOS They say that we must respect the work of the independent commissions, then they push bills in the House to overturn the work of the independent commissions. EOS BOS They have had a monopoly for years on sanctimony. EOS BOS Now they have a monopoly on sanctimonious hypocrisy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. EOS BOS I wanted to provide a response to the question of privilege raised by the member for Thornhill on November 2, respecting the Prime Minister's response to an oral question on Tuesday, October 31. EOS BOS I submit that the matter is a dispute as to the facts, and therefore does not meet the criteria for finding a prima facie question of privilege. EOS BOS Page 86 of the House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Second Edition, sets out the criteria for establishing whether a member has deliberately misled the House. EOS BOS It states:
              
                
                   it must be proven that the statement was misleading;...it must be established that the Member making the statement knew at the time that the statement was incorrect;...that in making the statement, the Member intended to mislead the House. EOS BOS I submit, these criteria have not been met. EOS BOS On October 31, 2017, in response to an oral question from the member for Edmonton—Strathcona, the Prime Minister stated the following:
              
                
                  ...two ministers had controlled assets held indirectly. EOS BOS The finance minister has announced that he is moving forward, going above and beyond what was originally asked. EOS BOS In the case of the other minister, those assets were divested 18 months ago. EOS BOS The Ethics Commissioner has confirmed that there is no difference of opinion on this issue between her and the Prime Minister. EOS BOS In fact, on November 2, 2017, the Ethics Commissioner released a statement that refutes the allegation that the commissioner is at odds with the statement made by the Prime Minister. EOS BOS I agree with the member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley who intervened on this issue. “ EOS BOS Now the reasons she has as Ethics Commissioner to keep the number somewhat vague, as less than five but more than one, is something that is at her discretion. EOS BOS That is not for us to judge.” EOS BOS Allegations of breach of privilege are often dismissed as disputes as to the facts. EOS BOS There are numerous precedents in support of this. EOS BOS Most recently, on May 5, 2016, the Speaker ruled: 
              
                
                   As members can appreciate, the threshold is very high, purposely so given the seriousness of the allegation and its potential consequences for members individually and collectively. EOS BOS From this, it stands to reason that a finding of a prima facie case of privilege is an exceedingly rare occurrence in cases with respect to disputed facts. EOS BOS I submit that the matter is a dispute as to the facts and therefore does not meet the conditions for a prima facie question of privilege. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. parliamentary secretary to the government House leader for his arguments on this point. EOS BOS I will come back to the House on the matter EOS BOS . I will take it under advisement for now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the backlog veterans face waiting for their pensions is a disgrace. EOS BOS Our veterans are going into debt just to make ends meet. EOS BOS This needs to stop now. EOS BOS There is a simple fix. EOS BOS Follow the military ombudsman's advice and do not discharge a veteran until all pensions, benefits, and services are in place and are understood. EOS BOS When is the minister going to get his house in order so that veterans are not left struggling to survive? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's investment in the Canadian Armed Forces pension plan reflects the important contribution made by its members in defending Canada's interests, both at home and abroad. EOS BOS The department continues to work diligently to improve the processing of Reserve Force members’ pensions. EOS BOS In July, the administration of Canadian Armed Forces pensions was transferred to Public Services and Procurement Canada. EOS BOS This is expected to streamline and improve the payment of pension benefits. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Saturday I attended the funeral of Carl Jason Dunphy, a young veteran from my riding who died tragically on February 11. EOS BOS A few hours before his death, he posted the following message about his difficulties in getting help from Veterans Affairs: “ EOS BOS It's eating away at my resources and my strength. EOS BOS It's not up to friends and spouses to deal with this because a government organization doesn't act.”
              (1155)
              [Translation]
              Carl Jason Dunphy's life, his service, and his memory deserve so much more than just a list of statistics read from a cue card. EOS BOS I am asking the minister again: will the department conduct an internal investigation of the circumstances surrounding his death? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his advocacy on behalf of veterans and their families and his constituents. EOS BOS I know this is an extremely difficult situation. EOS BOS Any time Veterans Affairs is notified of an untimely or unexpected death we undertake a review of that file, and this will be the case. EOS BOS Our government is committed to expanding access to support the veterans and RCMP and their families. EOS BOS That is why we are working with over 4,000 registered mental health professionals, we are expanding our outreach capability by having nine points of contact reopened, as well as hiring front-line staff. EOS BOS We will continue to support veterans and their families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada website states: The reappointment process for IRB members will continue to reflect a performance evaluation consistent with the merit-based competency criteria. EOS BOS The Minister will continue to recommend the reappointment of members...after taking note of the IRB Chairperson's recommendations concerning performance and operational needs. EOS BOS Could the government House leader tell us this? EOS BOS For the reappointed IRB members he has politically intimidated to resign, what specific problems with their performance were identified? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have said over and over again that the problem with the performance was the previous government's attempt, at five minutes to midnight, to appoint a whole bunch of people to jobs that took effect after it lost the election. EOS BOS This is a case of projection. EOS BOS The real scandal is on that side of the House and the Conservatives are somehow trying to project it over here. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous. EOS BOS This is political interference in the courts. EOS BOS Is there any court in Canada that can escape the reach of the new Liberal government? EOS BOS No one has ever done this before. EOS BOS No one has even had the gall to attempt something like this before. EOS BOS Every minister in the past who has interfered with these tribunals has resigned. EOS BOS When is he going to get to it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what a surprise to hear a member from that party speaking about attempting to intimidate a court. EOS BOS Canadians were shocked, and international jurists were shocked, when the former government tried to publicly intimidate the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. EOS BOS That is something we will never do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services was found guilty for interfering politically in a project to help friends of the Conservative Party, but she has not really come clean with Canadians, and a lot of questions remain unanswered. EOS BOS What did happen to that letter from the MP for Thornhill? EOS BOS Was it really lost, or did the Conservatives deep-six it? EOS BOS There are also allegations that the minister interfered in other projects. EOS BOS I will be bringing this issue to the ethics committee. EOS BOS It is a simple question. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives work with us to get to the bottom of these serious allegations, or will they continue to cover up for the very ethically challenged minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously the minister acted within good faith and within the discretionary authority that was available to her. EOS BOS The main goal was to improve accessibility for people with disabilities to a community centre. EOS BOS With respect to the ethics committee, I suspect the ethics committee might also want to take a look at the inappropriate mailings of the NDP, which have cost taxpayers $2.7 million. EOS BOS We might also want to look at the illegal $350,000 that NDP members accepted in campaign contributions, or the fact that they were charged $40,000 for illegal robocalls. EOS BOS I suspect the House of Commons, which is soon going to be garnishing their wages, will help us deal with that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have the right to know the truth. EOS BOS The report from the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner could not answer all the questions about funding for the Markham community centre. EOS BOS The minister even received a letter from the Minister of the Environment asking her to fund the project. EOS BOS Oddly enough, that letter has disappeared. EOS BOS When correspondence between two ministers disappears, that always raises suspicions. EOS BOS Can the minister help us find that letter and get to the bottom of this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have always believed that this project to improve access to the Markham centre for people with disabilities was valid and in the public interest. EOS BOS I can assure the member that I co-operated fully for the three years that the investigation was under way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when he was in opposition, the member who is now the Minister of Public Safety accused the Conservative government of wanting to hide the truth when it refused to open an inquiry on Afghan detainees. EOS BOS Now, the Liberal government is the one that is refusing to launch a public inquiry. EOS BOS What has changed? EOS BOS Why have the Liberals once again changed their tune? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, throughout our military operations in Afghanistan, Canada has committed to ensuring the individuals detained by the Canadian Armed Forces were handled and transferred and released in accordance with our obligations under international law. EOS BOS Canada's policies and procedures regarding detainees have already been subject to significant scrutiny, including an external review by the Federal Court, MPCC, and an internal review through multiple administrative investigations. EOS BOS I will be happy to make myself available to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner should she choose to revisit the issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the flawed study of the Afghan detainees scandal was cut short by the Conservatives after only reviewing an initial set of documents. EOS BOS Stéphane Dion at that point said, “ EOS BOS [w]hen you read these documents, you will have questions to ask to your Prime Minister”. EOS BOS He also said that the Conservatives were blocking an inquiry because of being “afraid of having to answer to Canadians”. EOS BOS Therefore, will the Minister of National Defence appear before the defence committee to answer questions about this scandal, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I stated, Canada's policies and procedures regarding detainees have already been subjected to scrutiny, including an external review by the federal court, MPCC, and an internal review through multiple administrative investigations EOS BOS . 
              I would be happy to make myself available to the Commissioner of Conflict of Interest and Ethics if she chooses to revisit this issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a disgrace that the Liberals have drastically cut funding for 70 military museums this year when we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation. EOS BOS It is shameful but very telling of the Liberals' lack of respect for the Canadians who served their country. EOS BOS Now that the minister has had the time to learn about this odious decision, which he seemed to be unaware of yesterday, can he explain the reason for the decision and tell us how much he has cut from the funding for these institutions that preserve the memories of our heroes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. EOS BOS I am just as concerned as he is. EOS BOS There is a museum in the riding of Saint-Jean. EOS BOS As the minister said yesterday, he is not familiar with the situation and he has asked for an update EOS BOS . We will be pleased to explain the situation to the member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 150th anniversary of Confederation and the 100th anniversary of the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge. EOS BOS The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario has a display on the victory at Vimy Ridge. EOS BOS Among the medals and artifacts one finds the words, “ EOS BOS Whenever the Germans found the Canadian Corps coming into the line they prepared for the worst. EOS BOS ” 
              Our Canadian heroes were not prepared for the latest in friendly fire from the Liberals in Ottawa. EOS BOS Why is funding for this museum and its Vimy exhibit being cut off by the Liberals this anniversary year? EOS BOS Why this Liberal war on history? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am very concerned by the member's question because there is a museum in the riding of Saint-Jean, right at the military college. EOS BOS Yesterday, the minister was informed of this matter. EOS BOS He has asked for an update on the situation, and we will be pleased to respond to the member during the next question period. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week I asked Dr. Merali, president and CEO of the Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, if brain imaging could be used to identify mefloquine toxicity. EOS BOS He said, absolutely so. EOS BOS Canada has the capability to scientifically validate our veterans' claims of brain stem injury from mefloquine. EOS BOS Veterans believe this drug is destroying their lives, causing severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister join our allies, commit to a mefloquine toxicity study, and stop using mefloquine and prescribing it to our soldiers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the health and well-being of all Canadian Armed Forces members are critically important to our government. EOS BOS Malaria is an infectious disease that can endanger the lives of our military personnel, who can be exposed in the course of their duties. EOS BOS Members of the military make personal decisions regarding malaria prevention in close co-operation with their health care professionals, based on an assessment and extensive medical information. EOS BOS Mefloquine remains a Health-Canada-approved drug that is offered to military personnel to prevent malaria. EOS BOS The use of this drug is now the exception. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during question period, the member for LaSalle—Émard—Verdun, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade, mentioned that our leader had spent funds on an international consultant on U.S. media. EOS BOS The last time I checked, I am the leader. EOS BOS I did not do this. EOS BOS I know I am new, but the member has known me since he was elected. EOS BOS If he could please retract and withdraw that comment— EOS </s> BOS It is debate. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade rising to respond. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I said the “former” leader of the opposition. EOS </s> BOS At any rate, I think the Leader of the Opposition has clarified that, and we will leave it there. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Outremont is rising on a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am the former opposition leader he just accused, and I can assure you that I had nothing to do with what he was just talking about. EOS </s> BOS It is still debate, but I am sure the House appreciates all of the clarification. EOS BOS [English]Now it is time for the regular Thursday question. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS opposition House leader. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has chosen a new commissioner of official languages. EOS BOS Apparently, all it takes to get this position is a $5,000 donation to the Liberal Party of Canada, a $500 donation to the Prime Minister's leadership bid, and being a former Liberal minister. EOS BOS This Liberal government's first appointment could not be more partisan, and that is a shame. EOS BOS Are being a long-time Liberal and donating to the party the criteria of the Prime Minister's new appointment process? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our two official languages are an important part of our history and our Canadian identity, and they are important to us. EOS BOS As far as appointments are concerned, our government is firmly committed to having a strong, open, transparent, and merit-based appointment process to find the best candidate for each position. EOS BOS We are very proud to have appointed a highly qualified Canadian woman under this new process. EOS BOS The Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages is very important and we are certain that the person recommended will have all the required qualifications. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week I asked if the Prime Minister would recuse himself from the appointment procedure for the new ethics commissioner, who may inherit the investigation into the Prime Minister's conduct, or whether he would just appoint a good Liberal to help get him off the hook. EOS BOS Perhaps signalling what is to come, last week he appointed a former provincial Liberal cabinet minister as official languages commissioner. EOS BOS If he likes to reward Liberals, may I suggest the Minister of National Defence as the new ethics commissioner? EOS BOS I hear he might be available soon. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our two official languages are at the heart of who we are as Canadians, but so is redefining the process by which we select highly qualified Canadians to fulfill important government appointments. EOS BOS We have revised that process to make it more rigorous, more open, more transparent, and more merit-based for all public appointments. EOS BOS We are proud to have appointed Canadians of the highest quality across all levels of government, thus far, through this process. EOS BOS The official languages commissioner has a very important role, and we will ensure that the recommended person meets that high qualification standard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservative cuts at Correctional Services Canada endanger the safety and security of the women and men who work inside the walls of our penitentiaries. EOS BOS The recent announcement about closing the Shepody Healing Centre in Dorchester, New Brunswick, a fully accredited psychiatric hospital, continues this trend and puts Canadians at greater risk. EOS BOS The hospital gave the staff the tools they needed to manage some of Canada's most difficult and dangerous psychiatric cases. EOS BOS Why is the minister being irresponsible and closing this important psychiatric facility, which is important to the safety of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS On the contrary, we are maintaining psychiatric care at the Shepody Healing Centre. EOS BOS Not only are we maintaining it, but we are enhancing it. EOS BOS From now on, every inmate who needs psychiatric care will have it 24/7. EOS BOS It is part of our mental health strategy. EOS BOS However, let us be clear: inmates with mental health problems should be in hospitals and not in penitentiaries. EOS BOS That is why we must continue to work with the provinces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary budget officer is concerned, and rightfully so. EOS BOS The government is using Bill C-44 to try to take away his power. EOS BOS As the parliamentary budget officer himself said, this will undermine his independence and political impartiality. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because, from now on, the parliamentary budget officer will have to report to the Speaker of the House, and he will have to submit his game plan for the year. EOS BOS I really like you, Mr. Speaker, but you should have nothing to do with the work of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS Why is the Liberal government stooping so low? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I already answered that question. EOS BOS Our plan is to strengthen the position of the parliamentary budget officer so that he can properly serve Parliament. EOS BOS He will have a meaningful mandate and be called upon to consider the economic and financial impacts of the issues submitted to him. EOS BOS As I also said, our government welcomes suggestions on ways to improve the bill. EOS BOS We are open to amendments to ensure we accomplish the objective of an effective and independent parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS We appreciate all of the work that he does. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the 308-page omnibus bill bears the signature of the Minister of Finance. EOS BOS My question is for him. EOS BOS How is it that this man, a dignified, honourable man who has always been steadfast, is now doing the Liberal government's dirty work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the parliamentary budget officer, this government believes—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I can hear the question. EOS BOS I need to hear the answer. I need to know if the minister says something unparliamentary, after all, or inappropriate or the other side. EOS BOS Let us hear the hon. EOS BOS leader of the government in the House. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I was just trying to say, we believe that when it comes to the important work the parliamentary budget officer does, the office should have its independence. EOS BOS It should have more effectiveness and more independence, and that is why we have introduced legislation to make this happen. EOS BOS We are open to amendments and we welcome them. EOS BOS When it comes to the member's referral to omnibus legislation, what we are proposing is to ensure there is not an abuse of omnibus legislation, like was the case under the Stephen Harper Conservative government. EOS BOS We are saying we can improve the way this place works. EOS BOS Let us have that conversation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in order to achieve this greater independence from the parliamentary budget officer, the Liberals have given the Speaker of the Senate veto power over his work plan. EOS BOS Who appoints the Speaker of the Senate? EOS BOS According to section 34 of the Constitution, it is the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Therefore, by independence, the Prime Minister means that the parliamentary budget officer will have to get prior approval to do his work from someone who is hand-picked by the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Is that the member's definition of independence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that the member understands the intent of this government in that we believe the parliamentary budget officer should have independence so he can serve Parliament in the best way possible. EOS BOS We believe we can improve the way and the resources to that office. EOS BOS As I have also said, we are open to amendments. EOS BOS We welcome constructive feedback. EOS BOS It is a very different approach than the previous government, obviously. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the approach of the previous Conservative government was to set up the parliamentary budget officer in a fashion that was independent, one of the reasons of which was to allow him or her to examine political party platforms before elections were called to determine if they were in fact costed properly. EOS BOS We know there has been a very severe problem with the Liberal costing in its last platform. EOS BOS In fact, it is about a $25 billion problem. EOS BOS Could it be that the Liberals are trying to shut down the independence of the parliamentary budget officer before their next political platform can be costed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we thank the parliamentary budget officer for his analysis of the provisions of Bill C-44. EOS BOS We look forward to working with him and others to improve the bill to ensure we accomplish the objective of having an effective and independent parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS Our government is committed to providing greater independence to the parliamentary budget officer, and this is the overriding intent of the legislation recently introduced in the House of Commons. EOS BOS We believe that it should be an officer who reports to Parliament, unlike the previous government, which felt that he should report to the Library of Parliament. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are 8,000 jobs in the greater Quebec City area associated with the Port of Québec. EOS BOS The ferry terminal project and the Foulon walkway project, which our party supported during the election campaign, are important to the port's prosperity. EOS BOS The Port of Québec is still waiting for an answer from the Liberal government. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister assure the people of Quebec City that he will not drag his feet and jeopardize jobs, as he is doing elsewhere in the country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we certainly recognize that the Port of Québec is an important port along the St. Lawrence that is part of Quebec's maritime strategy. EOS BOS This port plays a key role in the delivery of bulk commodities and, as my colleague mentioned, in the ferry sector. EOS BOS We are examining this request and will make a decision in the near future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday in committee, the nominee for Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner that the Liberals imposed on us would not confirm whether he plans to pursue the investigations into the Prime Minister's trip and the Minister of Finance's involvement in Bill C-27. EOS BOS Canadians are really concerned. EOS BOS These investigations are important to Canadians and certainly to our democracy, but the Liberals do not seem to realize that. EOS BOS Do the Liberals think the commissioner should continue the investigations his predecessor started? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians and especially parliamentarians expect officers of Parliament to perform their duties with integrity and to make decisions based on facts. EOS BOS That is exactly what the commissioner said he would do. EOS BOS He said he would not cater to partisan interests or needs and that the facts and intellectual rigour would dictate how he carries out his responsibilities. EOS BOS That is what we expect, whereas opponents seem to expect nothing but partisanship. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, is the Prime Minister trying to pretend that his selection process is not partisan? EOS BOS Canadians want the investigations into both the Prime Minister and the finance minister to be completed and reported. EOS BOS In committee yesterday, the government's nominee refused to commit to do so. EOS BOS These investigations are important for our democracy, and the Liberals must be held to account. EOS BOS Do the Liberals not agree that investigations already started need to continue under the new commissioner or do they believe they are above the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think the question is whether parliamentarians and Canadians expect officers of Parliament to fulfill their duties with integrity, with responsibility, and based on the facts. EOS BOS That is exactly what the commissioner testified to yesterday. EOS BOS That is what we all expect from agents of Parliament, to do their job responsibly, above the petty partisanship that so often animates the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House, the Minister of Finance presented the government’s plan. EOS BOS It is an ambitious, visionary plan that makes middle-class families the priority, both in Bourassa and elsewhere in Canada. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Finance tell us why he only chose certain sectors of the economy in his budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is very important to be an optimistic country and to make investments in the future, but we also need to know in which particular sectors we have a comparative advantage. EOS BOS That is exactly what we have done. EOS BOS We decided to be the world leader in very important sectors where there will be high-quality jobs in the future. EOS BOS We chose six sectors that are key to our children’s and grandchildren’s future. EOS BOS We will consider ways of providing the necessary training for the good jobs of the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year in Ontario alone there were 144 laser strikes on aircraft. EOS BOS The Ottawa International Airport in my riding is a possible venue for these types of incidents. EOS BOS Laser strikes can seriously blind someone operating an aircraft. EOS BOS All of us were very concerned by the recent event in Elgin County where a police helicopter was struck by a laser strike. EOS BOS This is serious business. EOS BOS Could the parliamentary secretary please inform the House on the actions the government is taking on this file to ensure air safety in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Ottawa South for his concern. EOS BOS Safety is a top priority for this government and we are also very concerned about the recent increase in laser strikes. EOS BOS Pointing a laser at an aircraft is more than just dangerous, it is also illegal. EOS BOS That is the reason why the Minister of Transport met with various law enforcement officials to emphasize just how reckless this action is and to ask for the public's help when they see something like this happening, for them to call 911 and let police officials know. EOS BOS That is the only way to make change. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, so much for Prime Minister's question period. EOS BOS The Liberals refused to allow a parliamentary investigation into the sweetheart deal between the Canada Revenue Agency and KPMG, but that was not the end of the sketchy story. EOS BOS A member of the Liberal-appointed panel looking into tax evasion attended an event sponsored by, guess who, KPMG. EOS BOS This was on top of appointing someone from KPMG as treasurer of the Liberal Party. EOS BOS How does the revenue minister explain this mess? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, cracking down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance is a priority for our government. EOS BOS We invested a historic $444 million, which has allowed us, in the first year alone, to carry out more audits, hire an additional 100 auditors, and recover $13 billion, including $1.3 billion through the voluntary disclosures program. EOS BOS That is just the beginning. EOS BOS With the additional amounts allocated in this year's budget, our second budget, we will recover even more money for Canadians next year. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, another member of that same panel accused seven ministers of not understanding the principles of independence at all, and I think she was right. EOS BOS When the Canada Revenue Agency let KPMG off the hook for its tax evasion scheme, what did the Liberals do? EOS BOS They appointed a director from KPMG to be the treasurer for the Liberal Party of Canada. EOS BOS What will it take for the Liberal government to admit that it is clearly in a conflict of interest? EOS BOS I want an answer that has to do with KPMG this time, not the talking points we keep hearing. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I just said because my colleague just does not get it. EOS BOS Cracking down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance is a priority for our government. EOS BOS My job is to produce results. EOS BOS With more auditors and more audits, we recovered an extra $13 billion last year. EOS BOS That is what I call results. EOS BOS We will invest in services for Canadians. EOS BOS That is what we promised, and that is exactly what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Minister of Finance met with his counterparts from across the country to work collaboratively and take action that was in the interests of all Canadians, to strengthen the middle class, and to help those working hard to join it. EOS BOS As a result, a number of agreements were reached, including a coordinated approach on the cannabis excise framework. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister inform the House on the cannabis agreement, and how it benefits provinces, territories, and municipalities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, cities and towns across the country are among our most important partners in our effort to legalize and strictly regulate access to cannabis. EOS BOS That is why we are providing the provinces and territories 75% of collected excise tax from cannabis, so municipalities can get the resources they need to keep cannabis away from kids and profits out of the hands of criminals. EOS BOS This agreement will be reviewed within six months of legalization to confirm that communities, cities, and towns are well supported by the provinces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the people of Quebec have been waiting for the new armoury for seven years, but they will have to keep waiting because last week, we found out that the work that has taken over Place George V will not be done in time for Canada's 150th anniversary in July 2017. EOS BOS The 150th anniversary celebrations will take place among scaffolding and orange construction cones. EOS BOS What a delight the celebrations will be. EOS BOS This reeks of ad hockery, and Quebec deserves better. EOS BOS Why did the Conservative government wait so long to start work on the new armoury? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we made a promise to rehabilitate the armoury, and we will keep that promise. EOS BOS It will take time, but we are doing our best to finish it as soon as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, believe it or not, but March will soon be upon us. EOS BOS In a few days, we will be celebrating International Women's Day and recognizing the enormous contribution of women to our society. EOS BOS That day is also an opportunity to look at what has been accomplished, but even more important, to consider the challenges that remain and the obstacles that must still be overcome to ensure greater equality between men and women. EOS BOS That applies to all sectors of society and to the military. EOS BOS What can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence tell the House about recent progress in ensuring better representation of women in the armed forces? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Dartmouth—Cole Harbour for drawing attention to International Women's Day. EOS BOS Canada is firmly committed to increasing the number of women at all rank levels. EOS BOS Major-General Tammy Harris will become the deputy commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, becoming the first woman to hold such a post in the navy, army, or air force. EOS BOS I hope that more women will work their way up the ranks so that, in the future, one of them will become the chief of the defence staff. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again the indigenous community has been excluded from the main discussion of provincial premiers on climate change. EOS BOS This blatant lack of respect flies in the face of the Prime Minister's promise to establish a new relationship with indigenous peoples. EOS BOS They are directly affected by climate change. EOS BOS Why have they not been invited to participate fully in the meetings on such a crucial issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleague knows, as all Canadians do, including indigenous Canadians, that there is no relationship more important to us than that with indigenous people in this country. EOS BOS That is why we recognize and we respect the rights of indigenous people, and their knowledge and expertise on vital subjects like climate change and its impacts. EOS BOS These are the reasons why the Prime Minister today is meeting with first nations, Inuit, and Métis leaders in Canada, to seek their input and to ensure that we have that full nation-to-nation relationship. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member is so right. EOS BOS Our self-proclaimed feminist Prime Minister promised a nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous people, particularly women. EOS BOS But approving pipelines without consent is not a nation-to-nation relationship. EOS BOS We see the same unwillingness today. EOS BOS The Native Women's Association of Canada asked repeatedly to be included in today's first ministers' meeting, and the Prime Minister refused. EOS BOS Is this how the Prime Minister treats his most important relationship? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think it is very clear that we have the utmost respect and our relationship with indigenous people is very important to us. EOS BOS That is why the Prime Minister is at the table with the three leaders of indigenous governments in this country today. EOS BOS That is why we continue to seek their input, seek their advice, and work in partnership with them, something that has not occurred in our country in the past. EOS BOS It is something we are very proud of and will continue to build on in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today we learned that the mayor of Huntsville is embarrassed about the emails that he sent on the G8 legacy fund. EOS BOS Unfortunately, he is mostly embarrassed they left a paper trail leading right to the current President of the Treasury Board, documenting his abuse of power. EOS BOS The President of the Treasury Board is too embarrassed to answer questions in the House, so will the Minister of Foreign Affairs confirm if he or any of his former staff have spoken with the RCMP about the legality of authorizing the use of border infrastructure funds for these projects? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I believe a defeated Liberal member of Parliament had a public election exercise in that regard. I cannot speak for the mayor of Huntsville, but what I can say is that 32 pieces of public infrastructure were supported. EOS BOS All 32 came in on time and all 32 came in on budget. EOS BOS We appreciate the work of the Auditor General and the good advice that she provided on how we can be even more open and more transparent to Parliament. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, without freedom of speech, no other freedom is possible. EOS BOS Canada was ranked eighth in the world by Reporters Without Borders in their 2015 World Press Freedom Index. EOS BOS After just one year under the current Prime Minister, we have dropped 10 spots, to number 18 in the world. EOS BOS Namibia, Jamaica, Costa Rica, are all ahead of us. EOS BOS Why is the Liberal government failing to uphold our freedom of speech and freedom of the press? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to human rights, this government has been unequivocal, both at home and abroad, around the world. EOS BOS Human rights is an integral part of our foreign policy because it is integral to who we are as Canadians. EOS BOS Canadians can rightly be proud of the progress we have seen, and which this government has helped achieve, in promoting and protecting human rights both at home and abroad. EOS BOS There is more to be done. EOS BOS We are just getting started. EOS BOS We look forward to working with members in the House and groups, both at home and around the world, to help advance human rights globally. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport's earlier response regarding funding for the Port of Québec was vague to say the least. EOS BOS The port is not the only organization in Quebec City waiting for news from this government. EOS BOS There is also the National Optics Institute, which is a very important institute that generates jobs. EOS BOS Nearly 4,000 jobs have been generated by this centre for development and applied research. EOS BOS If the port has to wait, will the NOI, which needs its funding by March 31, get a positive response from this government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand the great work done by this institute. EOS BOS It does great work to commercialize innovative ideas to market to help SMEs. EOS BOS We have had a productive conversation with it, and we will provide it with a timely response in regard to funding. EOS BOS We understand the importance of growing the economy. EOS BOS We understand the importance of innovation and creating jobs, and we will continue to work with that institute and other institutes across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, words are nice, but firm commitments are needed. EOS BOS The port and the National Optics Institute are not the only ones with needs. EOS BOS Université Laval also needs funding for the Institut nordique du Québec. EOS BOS The Liberal Party has yet to follow through on its commitments. EOS BOS The people of Quebec City want answers. EOS BOS The Liberals' track record in Quebec City in the first 100 days is zero plus zero, which equals zero. EOS BOS When will the government follow through on its commitments to the people of Quebec City? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our number one priority is the economy. EOS BOS We will make investments in aerospace, automotive, by-products, biopharmaceuticals, business services, chemicals and plastics, digital media, financial services, food and beverage, media devices, mining industries, oil and gas, renewable energy, retail, and software. EOS BOS I can go on and on, but the bottom line is that we will grow the economy and create jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, seasonal workers in all regions of Quebec have reached the end of their employment insurance benefits. EOS BOS They have to find another way to make it until the next season begins, either through social assistance or by living off their credit cards. EOS BOS In any case, they will have to go into debt. EOS BOS People are struggling and having a hard time putting food on the table, because the government refuses to understand the reality of our regions, because Ottawa does not give a damn about Quebec. EOS BOS When will this government wake up and recognize that it is the work that is seasonal, and not the workers, and resolve the spring gap or "black hole" problem once and for all, by extending the minimum entitlement period? EOS BOS This is urgent. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague for giving me the opportunity to remind the House of some very important measures our government has taken since coming to power to improve the quality of services to unemployed Canadians across the country, and especially the quality of benefits. EOS BOS Plus, we have also made it easier for Canadians to get the support they need from the Canadian government when they go through the often difficult time of a period of unemployment. EOS BOS There is still a lot of work to do, and we look forward to tackling it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been almost two weeks since the U.S. decided to apply duties of up to 24% on Canadian softwood lumber. EOS BOS It has been six months since President Trump's election and 18 months since the Liberals came to office, and the Liberals failed to see this coming. EOS BOS They failed to come up with a concrete plan to deal with this emerging crisis and to help the hundreds of thousands of families impacted. EOS BOS Can the minister confirm that she walked away from negotiations with Obama, thinking she could get a better deal with Trump? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the previous Conservative government allowed the agreement to expire and did nothing to initiate negotiations. EOS BOS We are now facing the fifth softwood lumber dispute, and our workers and producers have never been found in the wrong. EOS BOS We disagree strongly with the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to impose an unfair and punitive duty. EOS BOS The American accusations are baseless and unfounded. EOS BOS We continue to raise this important issue with the U.S., as the Prime Minister did with the President just last week. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister confirmed yesterday it was on his encouragement that the RCMP was instructed to violate the law and destroy government documents. EOS BOS If anyone needed any more proof that Ottawa is broken, they need look no further than a Prime Minister who puts direct pressure on the national police force to break the law. EOS BOS Has the Prime Minister become so out of touch that he thinks he can ask the RCMP to break the law and then write himself a nice little bill to absolve himself of responsibility? EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister really believe he is above the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to confirm to my hon. EOS BOS colleague that our government promised to get rid of the costly and ineffective firearms registry. EOS BOS That is what we did. EOS BOS One thing is clear: the Liberals would reinstate the registry and treat hunters and fishers in this country like second-class citizens. EOS BOS We will continue to stand up for stronger public safety laws without hindering those who hunt for sport. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since 2012, the Bloc Québécois has been speaking out against the federal government's decision to store artifacts from the national parks in a warehouse in Gatineau. EOS BOS The history of Quebec, from the founding of New France to the Forillon expropriation, must remain accessible to our historians, our archeologists, and the public. EOS BOS However, despite the opposition of the Quebec National Assembly and the City of Quebec, Ottawa spent $45 million on a warehouse that no one in Quebec wants. EOS BOS Will the government back off and leave our heritage and that of the first nations where it is, so that it is accessible to the people of Quebec, as the members of the Bloc Québécois have been calling for five years? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is important that the treasures that speak to our identity, our history, our culture, and the contributions of indigenous peoples be protected and preserved. EOS BOS Parks Canada is responsible for protecting that heritage. EOS BOS I am listening and I am prepared to work with my federal colleagues, the City of Quebec, the province, and the staff at Parks Canada in order to ensure that the public and anyone who is interested can access the artifacts in a timely manner. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that DFO is responsible for the funding, care and maintenance of core harbours, but anybody who lives in a coastal community also recognizes that non-core harbours still contribute to the economies of those communities. EOS BOS Until recently, officials confirmed that there was $5 million to fund health and safety issues for these non-core commercial harbours. EOS BOS Can the parliamentary secretary confirm how much is in the fund currently and whether or not an initiative like the Gabarus seawall would qualify for funding in this particular program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that our government recognizes the importance of safe and functional harbours to support the commercial fishing industry. EOS BOS I cannot give him the actual figure in that fund. EOS BOS I will be happy to get it to him later. EOS BOS It is my understanding that the Gabarus seawall does not qualify for that funding. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two years ago, the government set up a $200 million fund to support advanced manufacturing in Ontario, but as of now, it has not spent one penny. EOS BOS Since the government came to office, Ontario manufacturing jobs are down a staggering 25% and exports down 20%, yet Conservatives have not spent a penny of the fund. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister so disconnected from the economy that he no longer cares about struggling middle-class Canadians in the manufacturing sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is perfectly clear the member is describing his own leader when it was the Liberal leader who said that southern Ontario needs to transition “away from manufacturing-based employment as a driver in the economy”. EOS BOS That is what the Liberal leader said. EOS BOS By contrast, I visited SickKids hospital in Toronto last week and visited some advanced manufacturing in robotics that we invested in. EOS BOS One in 700 children is born with a cleft palate. EOS BOS Because of the investment we have made in advanced manufacturing, this is technology that is protecting kids, stopping infection, and fixing cleft palates. EOS BOS We are going to sell this technology all over the world, creating jobs and protecting kids well into the future. EOS BOS That is what we do as the Conservative government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a new report released yesterday proves that the pay gap for women in Canada is actually getting worse. EOS BOS Meanwhile, the costs of child care are astronomical and rising, putting enormous strain on households that include young families and making it more difficult for women to participate in paid work. EOS BOS It is almost always women who wind up making sacrifices in their career when affordable child care is not there. EOS BOS The Liberals promised Canadians that they would take action on a national child care program within the first 100 days. EOS BOS Where is it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party was elected on a platform of investing $20 billion over the next 10 years in social infrastructure, which includes social housing, seniors housing, and affordable child care. EOS BOS That approach is exactly what we are going to put forward in the budget. EOS BOS However, it is interesting to me that the member opposite would be talking about that, because if he were in government right now, he would be busy trying to figure out how to cut $18 billion of spending from government so he could balance the books at every cost, which was the commitment the NDP made in the election. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs gave a major speech on Canada's foreign policy, but she failed to mention Canada's foreign policy with respect to China. EOS BOS Now we know why. EOS BOS The minister of industry was quietly approving a Chinese takeover deal of Vancouver-based Norsat International, a company that builds satellite receivers for NATO. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister so eager to sell our military technology to Beijing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we take the protection of national security very seriously. EOS BOS We never have and never will compromise on national security. EOS BOS All investments reviewed under the Investment Canada Act are screened by Canada's national security agencies. EOS BOS The national security community conducted a rigorous review and confirmed that security procedures and safeguards were in place that were in keeping with our high standards. EOS BOS We always have and always will protect our national security. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it gets worse. EOS BOS Normally any deal involving this type of satellite technology would be subject to a formal, national security review. EOS BOS However, in a very troubling development, the industry minister decided that a national security review was not necessary for this Chinese takeover. EOS BOS Canadian national security interests are at stake here. EOS BOS Why did the Prime Minister allow this sale to China to go ahead without the comprehensive security review that it needed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the process was followed under the Investment Canada Act. EOS BOS As I stated before, we never have and never will compromise our national security. EOS BOS When it comes to our economic agenda and our overall Investment Canada Act regime, we are being very clear that in order to grow the economy and create jobs, we must be open to investments, open to trade, open to people. EOS BOS This is good for Canada and it is good for our economy. EOS BOS We will always defend the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is shocking. EOS BOS Hytera Communications has previously been accused of large-scale theft of intellectual property and the U.K. raised major red flags when Hytera tried to acquire a similar British company. EOS BOS Richard Fadden, the former head of CSIS, said that he would have recommended a full-fledged national security review of this deal. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister allowing his fascination with China and his overwhelming desire to appease it to cloud his judgment on the national security of our country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, under the Investment Canada Act, all transactions are subject to a national security review. EOS BOS Therefore, we followed the process. EOS BOS It was a rigorous process. EOS BOS We have been very clear that when it comes to the economy, when it comes to growth and jobs, we are open to investment, trade, and people. EOS BOS We always have and always will ensure that we never, ever compromise our national security. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think that the government does not realize what an enormous mistake it just made. EOS BOS We learned about something quite serious in this morning's Globe and Mail. EOS BOS Norsat in Vancouver, a manufacturer of high tech components for NATO satellites, has just been sold to Chinese interests, and unfortunately the national security protocol was not followed properly or carefully. EOS BOS Is this the Prime Minister's way of thanking his Chinese friends who paid top dollar to meet with him privately a year ago? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I disagree with my friend and colleague. EOS BOS [English]
              We have been very clear that the process was followed under the Investment Canada Act. EOS BOS We have always followed the law. EOS BOS We have made sure that we listen to our national security agencies and the experts and the advice they give us. EOS BOS Based on that advice and the feedback, we make decisions accordingly. EOS BOS We never have and never will compromise on national security. EOS BOS We have also been very clear that we are open to investment to ensure we grow our economy and create good quality jobs for the middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Norsat does not make shoes. EOS BOS It makes high-tech components that it sells to the U. S. Department of Defense and other NATO countries. EOS BOS This very valuable, very sensitive information is now in the hands of Chinese investors. EOS BOS The worst part is that this deal was not even subject to a national security review. EOS BOS Why did the government drop the ball on this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, I want to take this opportunity to correct the record. EOS BOS The member opposite is saying that this transaction was not subject to a national security review. EOS BOS That is not the case. EOS BOS All transactions under the Investment Canada Act are subject to a national security review. EOS BOS We have followed the process. EOS BOS We have done our due diligence. EOS BOS We have consulted the national security agencies. EOS BOS We will ensure that we never have and never will compromise our national security. EOS BOS At the same time, we are committed to growing our economy by ensuring we are open to investment, trade, and people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is an important issue for all Canadians and for our security. EOS BOS I know the minister, and I know him to be an honourable gentleman, so I want to give him a chance to correct something he has just said. EOS BOS In his first answers, he was particularly prudent. EOS BOS In his first of five answers he talked about a screening. EOS BOS However, he knows, and we all know, that a screening is not a national security review. EOS BOS He then said, “procedures were followed”, which can mean anything and nothing. EOS BOS At the very end, the minister started saying that there was a national security review, which had a definition. EOS BOS I would like him to clarify that. EOS BOS Was there or was there not a full national security— EOS </s> BOS The hon. Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under the Investment Canada Act, all transactions are subject to a national security review and to ensure that the process has been followed. EOS BOS Under this transaction, and all transactions, we followed the law. EOS BOS We made sure we did our homework, and we did our due diligence. EOS BOS Any feedback we receive from the national security agencies is taken seriously and taken into account before we make a decision. EOS BOS We always have and always will ensure that we never, ever compromise our national security. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I expect the minister would have no problem sharing the national security agencies' verdicts on this deal. EOS BOS In March, the Prime Minister  overturned a decision that Stephen Harper made and allowed China to take over the high-tech company we are talking about. EOS BOS Barely three months later, he is at it again. EOS BOS He is refusing to subject this takeover to a national security review even though Canada uses the company's technology for its own military purposes. EOS BOS My question to the Liberals is this: Why are you selling our military secrets to China? EOS
BOS I would remind the member for Outremont to direct his comments to the Chair. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the specific case raised by the member opposite, again, was with regard to O-Net. EOS BOS Let us be clear. EOS BOS We did not overturn a cabinet order. EOS BOS The previous government managed the process so poorly that it ended up in court. EOS BOS We made sure we did a rigorous process. EOS BOS We examined all the facts by our national security agencies and the law was followed. EOS BOS We always have and we always will ensure that we never, ever compromise our national security. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians were horrified to learn that young athletes were the victims of a national ski coach. EOS BOS To date, 11 victims have reported incidents that occurred over a period of eight years. EOS BOS That is extremely troubling. EOS BOS Can the minister tell the House what measures have been taken within the national sports federations to protect our young people? EOS BOS Can he tell us whether his department is investigating Alpine Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, safety for those participating in Canada's sports system is a priority for the government. EOS BOS Also, the government is working with national sports organizations, the Canadian Olympic Committee, and the Paralympic Committee to make sure that athletes are safe when they participate in sports. EOS BOS However, this matter is before the courts, and that is why we cannot comment on that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this just in: Canadian citizen and journalist Mohamed Fahmy has just received a letter from the government rejecting his request for a passport. EOS BOS The government is requesting a definitive signal from the court that a passport is needed, even though that has already been done. EOS BOS It requests proof that his previous passport is lost, even though that has been reported by the prosecutor in Egypt. EOS BOS Conservatives were incapable of getting Mr. Fahmy home here to Canada. EOS BOS Will the government at least provide him with a passport, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have a travel document prepared for Mr. Fahmy when he is able to travel. EOS BOS Canada continues to ask for the full and immediate release of Mr. Fahmy, and consular services are being provided to ensure Mr. Fahmy's well-being. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to a report from Global News, public servants are being forced to decide in a matter of minutes whether someone getting on a plane is a security risk even though they are already on the no-fly list. EOS BOS Incredibly, if someone on the no-fly list shows up at an airport, the airline then has to contact Transport Canada, and a government official then makes a last-minute decision on whether or not to let that person board the plane. EOS BOS This is not a good way to keep Canadians safe. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us when the no-fly list became the maybe-fly list? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS It is very important for us to make sure that everything is safe before a passenger boards a plane headed to Canada. EOS BOS That is why we put measures in place. EOS BOS We want to continue putting measures in place and hope the opposition will support us. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in February the RCMP made the unilateral decision to reclassify the Swiss Arms Classic Green carbine as a prohibited firearm. EOS BOS The Minister of Public Safety continues to blame this arbitrary decision on unelected bureaucrats; however, we now know that the RCMP had flagged issues to the minister's office regarding this firearm on numerous occasions, yet the minister failed to act and feigned outrage, insisting he had not been briefed. EOS BOS If the decision of the unelected bureaucrats is so unacceptable, why not draft legislation to limit their discretionary powers? EOS BOS When will the minister stand up for law-abiding gun owners by tabling firearm legislation with clearer definitions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to sit with a party that has committed to correct the Liberal mistakes of the past and make sure that law-abiding citizens are being respected. EOS BOS That is what this government is committed to and it is what I am committed to, and that is why I have brought forward amnesty for those people who have been affected by this classification issue. EOS BOS That is why we are moving forward to make sure that law-abiding citizens who are gun owners are respected in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians will not accept a measure that makes something illegal that ought not to be. EOS BOS Conservatives have been blatantly misleading Canadians about Canada's role in Iraq. EOS BOS Now they indicate they will be extending and expanding Canada's involvement in the Iraq war, and widening Canada's role with bombings in Syria. EOS BOS Can the government confirm it will be tabling a motion in the House either today or tomorrow and will the motion expand Canada's combat efforts into Syria? EOS </s> BOS Yes, Mr. Speaker, I can confirm what the Prime Minister said last week, that the government intends to table a motion seeking the concurrence of this House in an extension, an expansion, of the Canadian security mission against the genocidal terrorist organization ISIL that has declared war on Canada and is at least partly responsible for inspiring terrorist attacks here on our own soil last year and is attempting to engage in ethnic cleansing against religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria. EOS BOS Canadians believe that we should not sit on the sidelines. EOS BOS When it comes to defending our security and international security and opposing genocide, we have a role to play, and that is exactly what the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a right to know whether the scope of our military mission in Iraq will be expanded beyond training and support for the Kurdish forces and when that will happen. EOS BOS Our soldiers are already on the front line and are under fire from Islamic State militants. EOS BOS I repeat: can the government confirm it will be tabling a motion in the House today or tomorrow? EOS BOS Will this motion expand Canada's combat efforts into Syria? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that the government will soon table a motion to extend the security mission against the so-called Islamic State, because it poses a threat to international security and our security. EOS BOS This terrorist group has made threats against Canadians and is responsible for inspiring the terrorist attacks on Canadian soil last year. EOS BOS Canadians do not sit on the sidelines when it comes to important missions to defend our security and international security. EOS BOS We have a duty to take action and we will continue to take action. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact that the federal government is withdrawing its funding for affordable housing is shameful. EOS BOS Despite desperate needs, the government is going to terminate operating agreements for these housing units. EOS BOS By 2016, thousands of Quebec families will lose the financial support that helps them afford appropriate housing. EOS BOS This morning, I presented part of a petition, with over 6,000 of a total of 27,000 signatures, condemning these cuts, which will affect the most vulnerable people in Quebec. EOS BOS Does the government intend to renew this funding or is it going to again make the less fortunate pay for its deficits and absurd budget choices? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is completely absurd. EOS BOS It is our government that stabilized the housing market by allocating almost $2 billion over five years for affordable housing. EOS BOS It is our government that helped these people in need. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the Bloc opposed every initiative that we took to help these people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at the first finance committee meeting today, on our suggestion, it was agreed that we do some pre-budget consultations, bringing in witnesses from across Canada. EOS BOS A suggestion was made as well that the Minister of Finance appear at the committee. EOS BOS My question for the minister is this. EOS BOS Will he take the invitation and appear before the committee for pre-budget consultations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her question. EOS BOS I can say that I have done an enormous number of pre-budget consultations across this country, in actuality from coast to coast. EOS BOS We have seen people from all sectors of the economy. EOS BOS I have listened more than any minister of finance has ever listened in the history of this country. EOS BOS We have 3,500 budget submissions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I found that really funny. EOS BOS It is going to be hard after that. EOS BOS It is kind of weird. EOS BOS One of the things I did note in committee today, in all fairness, is that we do not want pre-budget consultations at the committee to hold up the budget. EOS BOS Canadians want a budget. EOS BOS They want a plan. EOS BOS They want to know what is going on. EOS BOS My question to the Minister of Finance is pretty simple. EOS BOS Does he feel he has the ability to actually make a decision and tell us when the budget will be? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for her question. EOS BOS I would like to remind her what happened last year when the budget was actually announced far after the traditional season. EOS BOS This year we are working to listen to Canadians as best we can. EOS BOS We have heard from thousands upon thousands of Canadians. EOS BOS We have had 3,500 submissions. EOS BOS We owe it to Canadians to actually go through those submissions. EOS BOS We are doing so. EOS BOS We will get to the budget as expeditiously as we can, recognizing our challenging economic environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we want to know what the Minister of Finance has to say. EOS BOS Today the House is debating an opposition motion that stems from the “ EOS BOS Fiscal Monitor” EOS BOS put out by the Department of Finance, which clearly indicates that the Conservative government left a surplus. EOS BOS However, members of this government continue to deny the truth. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance set an example and stand up here to tell the House that he has confidence in his own officials? EOS BOS Will he acknowledge that his government inherited a $1-billion surplus? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the only people who believe that the previous Conservative government left a surplus are the Conservatives themselves. EOS BOS Canadians will not be fooled. EOS BOS Make no mistake, the Government of Canada is going to run a deficit for the 2015-16 fiscal year, a deficit that will result from the previous government's measures and inaction. EOS BOS That is a fact. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians support infrastructure investments, but few Canadians support the unnecessary deficits that result from Liberals funding their pet projects. EOS BOS We know that as deficits increase, confidence in the government's ability to manage decreases. EOS BOS There is every indication that the government is going to post a deficit of more than $20 billion. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance tell the House that that is not the case? EOS BOS How large will the Liberal deficit be? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is particularly ironic that members from a party that inherited a $13 billion surplus from a Liberal government in 2006 and then added $150 billion in debt to Canadians are talking to us about this. EOS BOS On top of that, they did it while creating the lowest rate of growth since the Great Depression, maybe because they spent the money on things like gazebos. EOS BOS We have a different plan. EOS BOS We are going to spend on productive assets that can help our country to do better in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a new report from the City of Vancouver shows that homelessness doubled in the last year. EOS BOS Despite this urgent crisis, the government has not invested a dime for housing in the budget. EOS BOS In fact, it was not even mentioned. EOS BOS How can the government justify no new federal investments when housing in Vancouver is so unaffordable or non-existent for so many? EOS BOS Vancouver's city council has led the way to end homelessness, but it cannot do it alone. EOS BOS Will the government heed Vancouver's call to invest in housing to keep thousands more people from becoming homeless in the next two years, which is what it is predicted ? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has made unprecedented investments in helping people fight homelessness by ensuring they have access to affordable housing. EOS BOS Through our economic action plan, over 14,000 projects that would help many more families than that, were initiated. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the NDP voted against them. EOS BOS We also signed five-year agreements with the provinces so they would have stable, predictable funding to fight homelessness and to promote affordable housing and, sadly, the NDP voted against every one of those initiatives as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think the minister knows that the federal investment was a one-time deal that ended and fell far short of what actually needs to be done for affordable housing in this country. EOS BOS The fact is that over 600,000 families in Canada rely on social housing. EOS BOS With the end of the federal money, low-income households will see their housing costs skyrocket, leading to more insecurity. EOS BOS Why is the government so oblivious to maintaining the affordability of the social housing we have, like co-ops, and ignoring the desperate plight of Canadians who still remain homeless today? EOS BOS Why is the minister not addressing that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are addressing it. EOS BOS Those 600,000 families that rely on affordable housing are getting support for that housing from our government. EOS BOS Again, the NDP voted against that support. EOS BOS We have tens of thousands of families that now have access to affordable housing that did not exist before this government came into power. EOS BOS That is because we have made a commitment to help them. EOS BOS We signed a five-year agreement with the provinces to support affordable housing and combat homelessness. EOS BOS It is working. EOS BOS There is a ways to go, but we have made our commitment to support Canadians in need. EOS BOS It is too bad the NDP will not support us in supporting them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, northern Ontario is a vast region with communities of all sizes scattered throughout the area. EOS BOS Promoting economic development is a challenge in this region. EOS BOS However, northern Ontario has many advantages and considerable potential. EOS BOS [English]
              There is a large potential to be unlocked in the region with the many emerging innovative ideas and companies from the region. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development let us know what steps he has taken to promote local regional economic development in northern Ontario? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Sudbury for his question. EOS BOS He and his colleagues from the region are staunch supporters of northern Ontario. EOS BOS [English]
              I was excited to be in northern Ontario to announce an increase of $25 million for FedNor. EOS BOS Along with the launch of this, we also put forward the prosperity and growth strategy for northern Ontario. EOS BOS This will help the community; this will help indigenous communities; this will help diversify the economy; and, in particular, this will help small businesses grow and scale up, which will create good-quality jobs in northern Ontario. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, let us talk about apologies. EOS BOS The Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism and his office seriously tainted the sacred and solemn nature of the citizenship oath in Canada by organizing a bogus ceremony at the Sun News studio. EOS BOS As a former immigration minister, I am embarrassed and appalled by this situation. EOS BOS [English]The minister is now using his department like a branch of central casting and forcing his officials to be stunt doubles. EOS BOS This is totally shameful and unacceptable. EOS BOS I would like the minister to stand up and apologize to Canadians. EOS BOS He has to come clean on that. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, several dozen special citizenship and reaffirmation ceremonies are organized every year by CIC officials. EOS BOS They do a great job. EOS BOS Some are in Citizenship Week, some on Canada Day, and sometimes with lieutenant governors and premiers. EOS BOS We commend them for their good work. EOS BOS In this particular instance, some of the people invited did not come. EOS BOS The officials managing the ceremony, without any knowledge or involvement of my office in any part, handled the situation inappropriately. EOS BOS I regret that. EOS BOS It ought not to have happened, but let us not allow it to colour the excellent work that CIC officials do in celebrating Canadian citizenship. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, facts are facts. EOS BOS They can be checked. EOS BOS Let us look at the Minister of Finance's record: he imposed a tax reform to raise taxes on small businesses; he was fined by the Ethics Commissioner because he failed to declare one of his companies that owned one of his villas in France; he failed to put his assets in a blind trust; he sold $10 million worth of shares in his company days before introducing tax measures that he himself put in place; and he introduced Bill C-27, which earned his family's company more than $5 million. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister call for his Minister of Finance to resign? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can understand why the members across the way keep making these personal attacks. EOS BOS It is because the real record of our Minister of Finance is extremely positive: 441,000 new jobs created in the past 12 months, breaking an 18-year record. EOS BOS We are creating the strongest economic growth in the G7. EOS BOS We are helping Canadian families succeed after 10 years of a Conservative government that did not give families the help they need. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the finance minister's main role is to manage finances, the money that Canadians worked hard to earn. EOS BOS This is the reality: a deficit of more than $20 billion at the expense of our children and grandchildren, higher taxes for businesses, higher taxes for families, and no plan to balance the budget. EOS BOS My wish for Canadians in 2018 is that the Prime Minister do the right thing: fire the finance minister and find one with integrity who will be transparent and do his job in a responsible manner. EOS </s> BOS The personal attacks keep coming, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS The reality is that the Minister of Finance has met expectations, especially those of Canadian families, with respect to Canada's economy. EOS BOS The first thing he did was lower taxes for the middle class by raising them for the wealthy. EOS BOS Then he established the Canada child benefit, which helps nine out of ten families and will lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. EOS BOS He does that by not sending benefit cheques to the families of millionaires like the former government did. EOS BOS We are creating economic growth that is benefiting Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry recently made comments that may lead people to believe that the Business Development Bank of Canada, the BDC, is about to invest $10 million in a capital fund for co-operatives in Quebec, or that it has already invested that amount. EOS BOS However, bank officials say that it is not the case, because the bank's current mandate does not allow them to invest in such a fund. EOS BOS The Senate has already proposed, in a report, a change to the bank's mandate. EOS BOS Bank officials would like the mandate to be changed, and co-operatives across the country would also like it. EOS BOS My question is very simple: when will the BDC's mandate be reviewed and revised? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member raises the issue of co-operatives. EOS BOS We agree that co-operatives are an economic engine in our country, and that they create jobs. EOS BOS That is why we followed up on the report's findings and repatriated the co-operatives branch in the Department of Industry. EOS BOS As for the BDC, it was a major player in the support plan, when the time came to inject accelerated funds, during the financial crisis. EOS BOS The BDC is still providing support. EOS BOS Funds are available, both for co-operatives and for technology. EOS BOS The BDC is undergoing a review process, which will be properly carried out, as it should. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is empty rhetoric. EOS BOS The question is on BDC's mandate. EOS BOS The act requires that the mandate be reviewed as of 2010. EOS BOS If I am not mistaken, the review process began in July 2010. EOS BOS Section 36(2) of the Business Development Bank of Canada Act provides that the minister must report to this House within one year after the review is undertaken. EOS BOS That was in July 2010 and this is now February 2013. EOS BOS It has been more than two years. EOS BOS Therefore, why does the minister not comply with the legislated deadlines imposed on him? EOS BOS Why does he not comply with the law of Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, many reforms and initiatives were announced in recent months. EOS BOS Canada is now positioning itself as one of the best countries, when it comes to the economy in general. EOS BOS We were the last to enter the recession and the first to come out of it. EOS BOS Over 900,000 net new jobs were created since the recession. EOS BOS The BDC has indeed played a role in this. EOS BOS It continues to do so, and the review is ongoing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while Conservative talking points claim otherwise, the reality is that our economy continues to struggle. EOS BOS Growth is stagnating. EOS BOS Debt is mounting. EOS BOS Youth unemployment is still at record highs, and six of the biggest banks had their credit ratings cut. EOS BOS Yesterday, we saw new mass layoffs of hundreds of workers from Best Buy, Future Shop and Sears. EOS BOS With signs of economic trouble all around, why are the Conservatives not changing direction to deal with these new challenges? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that there are many Canadians looking for work, but there are a lot less than there were just a few short months ago. EOS BOS We have seen 900,000 net new jobs created. EOS BOS That is a very good start, but it is why our party and our government are committed to doing even more to create jobs, hope and opportunity. EOS BOS We saw in the November economic growth rates a substantial increase in economic growth. EOS BOS We remain committed and focused on even more, so that every Canadian will have the dignity of a job and the pride of being independent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government had promised that plans for the future Quebec City armoury would be unveiled in the fall of 2011. EOS BOS The plans are ready, but the Prime Minister's Privy Council is refusing to release them. EOS BOS The Conservatives are refusing to confirm the project schedule. EOS BOS They are refusing to tell us the total project cost and the costs to date. EOS BOS In short, once again there is a code of silence. EOS BOS What are the Conservatives hiding? EOS BOS Can the Conservative government tell us how much it will cost? EOS BOS Why such a lack of transparency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know there is a great deal of interest in Quebec City for this project, for good reason. EOS BOS It is one of our historical treasures in Canada. EOS BOS As the member may know, transparency has been obvious. EOS BOS There have been a number of public consultations with all of the stakeholders involved. EOS BOS We are very excited about the renovations and rehabilitation of the manège. EOS BOS I ask her to be patient. EOS BOS We will make those details known very soon. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities two years ago, but there is still no independent mechanism in place to ensure that it is complied with, even though that was a requirement under the convention. EOS BOS This Saturday is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. EOS BOS Unfortunately, it will be another opportunity to underscore this government's inaction and empty promises. EOS BOS Why this refusal to establish independent oversight of the implementation of the UN convention? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish everyone a happy International Day of Persons with Disabilities. EOS BOS It is very important that we help persons with disabilities, and we have launched a number of programs to that end.
							[English]For example, the registered disability savings plan has far exceeded our expectations in terms of take up. EOS BOS It will help families with someone who is dependent upon them plan for the future. EOS BOS We have also provided additional funding for the disabled, so that they can attend post-secondary education, and made it easier for them to get financed. EOS BOS We are doing a lot to help the disabled and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in my province of Saskatchewan almost 10% of all judicial appointments remain vacant. EOS BOS These vacancies have lingered since the Liberals were elected 18 months ago. EOS BOS The Chief Justice of Saskatchewan has been very clear. EOS BOS He has said, “ EOS BOS Talk is cheap. EOS BOS ”
              We all know there are plenty of qualified candidates to fill these vacancies. EOS BOS However, the justice minister continues to stand by as accused murderers and even rapists go free. EOS BOS How many families will be denied justice before the minister finally does her job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to say that the government is walking the walk on this side of the House when it comes to judicial appointments. EOS BOS Our government has implemented an open, transparent, and merit-based appointments process. EOS BOS Since being elected, we have appointed 51 judges, including 22 deputy judges, across the country. EOS BOS Under our merit-based appointments process, 60% of the judges named have been women. EOS BOS That is up 35% from the last government. EOS BOS In addition, budget 2017 provides funding for 28 new judicial positions. EOS BOS We look forward to filling them with great dispatch. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week, the Chief Electoral Officer recommended limiting the length of election campaigns. EOS BOS It just so happens that I have introduced a bill that would cap the election period at 46 days. EOS BOS In the last election, Stephen Harper doubled spending limits by extending the election to 11 long weeks. EOS BOS This cost the taxpayer $440 million. EOS BOS Canadians want to remove the influence of money and attack ads from our elections. EOS BOS Will the Liberals support my bill to limit the length of elections? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member opposite for his work on this. EOS BOS The government is anxious to work with him to undo many of the changes that happened in the unfair elections act, and also to specifically look at making sure that both the length of elections and the rules are as fair as possible for everyone. EOS BOS I also want to say that we are very acutely listening to the Chief Electoral Officer's comments on the need to modernize our system, the need to improve it, and to bring it into the 21st century. EOS BOS I know the party opposite is working hard with us to do that. EOS BOS I hope all members in the House will work with us on this process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a few years ago, an opposition member asked the parliamentary budget officer to have a look at the true cost of the F-35s, and did we ever learn a lot. EOS BOS Who was it who had asked? EOS BOS It was the current Minister of Fisheries. EOS BOS Unfortunately, under the changes his government wants to make, the PBO would no longer be able to study such things. EOS BOS The minister wants to prevent us from having the same opportunities that he himself had. EOS BOS He also wants to prevent the parliamentary budget officer from undertaking any studies that were not already planned at the beginning of the year. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals want to put the government spending watchdog in a straitjacket? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to giving more independence to the parliamentary budget officer, and that is the primary objective of the bill recently introduced in the House of Commons. EOS BOS Our government welcomes suggestions on ways to improve the bill, and we are open to amendments to ensure we accomplish the objective of an effective and independent parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS We appreciate the work he does. EOS
BOS Let us try this again. EOS BOS A rose by any other name, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS The answer we just heard is total nonsense. EOS BOS The PBO itself is saying that Liberals are restricting its ability to do its job. EOS BOS The Liberal omnibus bill will allow the government to shut down any PBO work that is not to the government's liking. EOS BOS It will give the Senate veto over the parliamentary budget officer's work and stop Canadians from getting the answers they so rightly deserve. EOS BOS These changes are clearly not designed to help accountability. EOS BOS They are designed to help the Liberal Party in governing. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals keep pursuing these unaccountable changes? EOS BOS When will they finally turn a corner and do what they promised to do for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to providing greater independence to the parliamentary budget officer, and this is the overriding intent of the legislation recently introduced in the House of Commons. EOS BOS Our government welcomes suggestions on how to improve the bill and we are open to amendments to ensure we accomplish the objective of an effective and independent parliamentary budget office. EOS BOS We appreciate the work he does, and I look forward to working with the member opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in Edmonton, the Prime Minister was asked a very direct question. EOS BOS His response, or his non-response, was very troubling, troubling to every resource worker who is laid off and all of their families that are worrying about where their next paycheque will come from. EOS BOS The Prime Minister could not bring himself to say yes yesterday, so I am going to ask him here one more time. EOS BOS If job-creating energy projects get through his new process at the National Energy Board, will the Liberal cabinet also approve them, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we find it pretty ironic that members on the opposite side, who were not able to get resources to tidewater over nine years, are talking about what we are trying to do. EOS BOS We are looking for a way to actually get resources to tidewater. EOS BOS We have been very clear about this point. EOS BOS We are working hard to get the licence required to do that. EOS BOS We are convinced that our approach will make a real difference for people in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and across this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is the problem. EOS BOS The Prime Minister already has a record of blocking job-creating energy projects. EOS BOS Northern gateway was approved with 204 conditions, but then the Prime Minister killed it with his unilateral transportation ban off the west coast, so that is his record. EOS BOS It would do a lot more for investor confidence and public confidence if the government would stand behind its own process. EOS BOS I ask again, if new projects get through this new process, will they be approved by the Liberal government, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with respect to the hon. member, here is the real problem. EOS BOS The real problem is that the Conservatives were not able to do anything over nine years getting resources to market. EOS BOS On what basis do they have any credibility in asking us how we are going to do it? EOS BOS We are going to take an approach that is actually going to get resources to tidewater. EOS BOS We are going to make a difference for the people who need us to make a difference across this country, creating real economic growth through getting our resources to market. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a desperate need for health care services and Ottawa is not doing its part. EOS BOS Its transfers are woefully inadequate and well below what it could be providing. EOS BOS Its lack of commitment is threatening the viability of the public system and putting unbearable pressure on the finances of Quebec and the provinces. EOS BOS There was nothing in the last budget to correct the situation. EOS BOS The government said that it would talk to Quebec and the provinces about this. EOS BOS However, the finance ministers are getting together next Monday and Ottawa does not even plan on addressing the issue. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Finance confirm that the pseudo-discussions he talked about when he tabled the budget are essentially a load of rubbish? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I stated in the House earlier this week, I am working with my colleagues in the provinces and territories to negotiate a new health accord. EOS BOS Within that accord we will make new investments in health care in our country. EOS BOS I look forward to working with all of the health ministers across the country. EOS BOS I have already had conversations with Minister Barrette in Quebec and my other officials. EOS BOS We look forward to announcing a new health accord hopefully later this year. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday we asked the Minister of Veterans Affairs to give Canadians an explanation as to why the Liberals were cancelling the Afghanistan war memorial. EOS BOS There were 40,000 brave men and women in Afghanistan, some who trained in my riding of Base Borden and served there. EOS BOS All he had to say was: “ EOS BOS More information regarding the project will be available in the coming months”.Why will the Liberals not honour our veterans and why can the minister not provide a straight answer? EOS BOS [Translation] Why did this Liberal government and this minister cancel the plan for the Afghanistan war memorials? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the question because I thought I answered it very clearly yesterday. EOS BOS It is important to honour the men and women who served in Afghanistan. EOS BOS In 2014, an all-party motion was put forward, and it was accepted by the House. EOS BOS I am working closely with the Minister of Canadian Heritage to see this memorial built. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week Liberals again excluded the Native Women's Association of Canada from high-level federal-provincial-territorial meetings, and it is not the first time. EOS BOS Indigenous women were shut out of first ministers meetings in October, March, and last December. EOS BOS NWAC was not even invited to a reconciliation meeting with the Prime Minister. EOS BOS We need a diversity of voices, and leaving women out means they only get half the wisdom. EOS BOS How can this so-called feminist Prime Minister call this reconciliation, when he keeps blocking indigenous women's voices? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is simply not true. EOS BOS We continually work with indigenous women's organizations and indigenous groups across this country to ensure that all voices—youth, elders, women, and survivors of residential schools—are heard in every possible forum. EOS BOS We know that the work of reconciliation needs to involve everyone, not just indigenous people and the government but non-indigenous Canadians as well. EOS BOS That is the work we are doing. EOS BOS That is what we take so seriously and what we are focused on as we build a brighter future that includes everyone in this country's success. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, speaking of survivors, those of St. Anne's residential school have been forced to go back to court to end interference by government lawyers. EOS BOS The Liberals have been fighting those survivors for years by covering up documents and forcing them to find witnesses to verify evidence, and now the Liberals want them to pay for court costs. EOS BOS This is a re-victimization of survivors who have suffered horrific levels of abuse. EOS BOS When will the government commit to real partnership with survivors? EOS BOS If I was asked, I would say that this does not seem like a real partnership. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we must never allow this dark and painful chapter of our history to be forgotten. EOS BOS We are encouraging all survivors to share their stories and documents with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. EOS BOS Where an individual requests it, our government is willing to absolutely waive privilege and encourages all other entities to do exactly the same. EOS BOS We remain committed to bringing closure to this system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in response to the Auditor General's scathing report, the Conservatives tried to mislead veterans and their families. EOS BOS They said that the $200 million that they promised for veterans would be spent over a period of six years. EOS BOS However, we now know that the money will be spent over a period of 50 years. EOS BOS Fifty years. EOS BOS How can the government defend such subterfuge? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we take not only the mental health of our veterans very seriously, but also members of the Canadian Armed Forces and members of their families. EOS BOS This is why we announced an investment last Sunday of eight new additional operational stress injury clinics, the major one being in Halifax and the other satellite offices right across the country. EOS BOS This is in addition to 13 operational stress injury clinics that we have already implemented since taking office. EOS BOS Under the Liberals, there were only four. EOS BOS There will now be 25. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in its own press release, the government spoke of “providing an additional investment of approximately $200 million over the next six years”, when, in fact, the investment is over 50 years. EOS BOS We know the government is ashamed of this paltry $200 million over 50 years attempt to mislead the veterans. EOS BOS Why else would the website announcing the program have disappeared from the Internet? EOS BOS How can the government explain these actions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reason we are investing millions of dollars in veterans' benefits, services and mental health is because on this side of the House we take the issue of mental health services very seriously when it comes to our veterans. EOS BOS This is exactly why we are putting more operational stress injury clinics right across the country, more health care professionals, more places for veterans and still-serving members to get help. EOS BOS We are expanding the treatments right across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we can clearly see how much this matters to the government. EOS BOS The veterans affairs minister has not answered a single question, not one, all week. EOS BOS Once they got caught trying to deliberately mislead veterans, the Conservatives deleted the website announcing the program and the minister's office went silent. EOS BOS How can Canadians and veterans trust anything the government says when it clearly will say anything to try and stop the damage? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, we all know the record of the opposition when it comes to standing up for Canada's veterans. EOS BOS Any initiative our government brings forward to help Canada's veterans the opposition has opposed. EOS BOS We will continue to invest when it comes to veterans' benefits and services. EOS BOS This is exactly the reason why last week we announced eight new operational stress injury clinics right across the country, so there would be more places for veterans and their families to get the help they need. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when Canada's veterans were asked to serve, they did so without hesitation. EOS BOS However, when they need our help, the Conservative government just walks away. EOS BOS The Auditor General was clear. EOS BOS Canadian veterans are not getting access to necessary mental health services in a timely manner. EOS BOS Apparently the minister thinks it is okay to take 50 years to fix the problem. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives trying to paper over their failure to support our veterans rather than fixing the problems? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we thank the Auditor General for his report. I want to point out the Auditor General has recognized that Veterans Affairs does, indeed, have a robust health strategy in place. EOS BOS We have put in place mental health support and have provided rehabilitation to our veterans in a timely manner. EOS BOS At the same time, the Auditor General did point out that there were some unnecessary delays, which the department and our government are working to address. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member makes it sound like it is some kind of detail in the Auditor General report that the Conservatives just have to kind of fix. EOS BOS That is not the case at all. EOS BOS That report was a scathing indictment of the lack of care and compassion and services needed by our veterans. EOS BOS It is time they address the issues raised in the report, and do it honestly and properly, starting with an apology to our veterans. EOS BOS Where is the minister? EOS BOS Why is he not here apologizing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite can yell and scream all he wants, but I am sure that what Canadian veterans and Canadians would like him to do is to start standing up for Canada's veterans, especially when it comes to standing up and voting in favour of the initiatives that our government brings forward, such as the eight new clinics that were announced just last Sunday, which will help not only veterans but also still-serving members and members of their families. EOS BOS Our government has a strong record. EOS BOS On this side of the House we will continue to stand up for Canada's veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. EOS BOS This is a minister who, rather than fixing the disgraceful record of his government on caring for veterans, chose instead to mislead Canadians about the mental health care they can expect to receive. EOS BOS He has literally run away from veterans and their families, while those who have served our country face a mental health crisis of unprecedented proportions. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives more interested in covering up their shameful treatment of Canada's veterans than in actually helping our veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General clearly said that Veterans Affairs has put in place important mental health supports. EOS BOS Access to mental health support under the rehabilitation program is timely. EOS BOS At the same time, we accept all recommendations put forward by the Auditor General, including where he suggested that there are some unnecessary delays in the paperwork and the application process. EOS BOS We will address that. EOS BOS The department is already working on those initiatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' attitude towards our veterans is unacceptable. EOS BOS On Sunday, the minister announced with great fanfare a $200 million mental health program for veterans. EOS BOS Great news. EOS BOS However, today we learned that this program spans a period of 50 years. EOS BOS Fifty years. EOS BOS Once again, our veterans are being sold a bill of goods by this government. EOS BOS Why does the minister not understand that our veterans need mental health care now, and not in 50 years? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are responding not only to the needs of today's veterans, but also to the needs of veterans in the future. EOS BOS As I mentioned, there were only four operational stress injury clinics when our government took office. EOS BOS We have already put in place 13 operational stress injury clinics across the country. EOS BOS Just last Sunday we announced eight additional satellite offices across this country, the major one being in Halifax. EOS BOS We will continue to stand up for Canada's veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been 11 days since the crippling tariffs have been levied on our small and medium producers. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we are hearing from concerned producers, manufacturers, and fearful forestry workers. EOS BOS The minister says we should expect job losses. EOS BOS This is unacceptable, and Canadians deserve better. EOS BOS What is the minister doing to reassure the over one million Canadians who depend on the forestry industry for their livelihoods, and what is the plan for our communities that depend on forestry? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has been working for many months across many departments in the Government of Canada and, just as importantly, with all of the ministers from the provinces. EOS BOS We know that it is our first responsibility to help the workers who might be displaced, the producers whose companies are at risk, and the communities that will be affected. EOS BOS Not only is it important to look at the short term, but also the long term, and we are also very active on that front, by an expansion of export markets and diversification. EOS BOS We are very focused on this issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Department of Commerce levelled a direct attack on our forestry producers last month with new tariffs on softwood lumber. EOS BOS According to Michael Froman, the former U.S. trade representative, the Liberal government had an opportunity to sign an agreement last year with an offer from the Obama administration, but it chose to wait, thinking it would get a better deal with the Trump government. EOS BOS [English] EOS BOS What is up now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's forestry industry supports hundreds of thousands of good, middle-class jobs. EOS BOS We strongly oppose the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to impose an unfair, punitive tax. EOS BOS Their accusations are unfounded. EOS BOS We will continue to bring the matter up with the United States, just as the Prime Minister did with the U.S. President. EOS BOS The coalition never offered conditions that Canada could accept. EOS BOS We want a good agreement, not just any agreement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when the wife of a Canadian soldier with severe PTSD went to the Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities, she was told, “You married him. EOS BOS It's your responsibility.” EOS BOS When a young mom and cancer survivor asked why the government continued to deny her benefits, the minister compared her question to the old question, “ EOS BOS When did you stop beating your wife?” EOS BOS To a thalidomide survivor, this same minister quipped, “ EOS BOS Everyone in Canada has a sob story.” EOS BOS My question for the Prime Minister is simple. EOS BOS Do these comments reflect the position of his government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has responded to these allegations. EOS BOS He is working right now on important accessibility legislation for helping every person with disabilities in this country. EOS BOS When he was minister of veterans affairs, he delivered on our commitment to increase the caregiver recognition benefit and reopened offices across the country that Conservatives shuttered. EOS BOS He will continue to be a strong advocate for persons with disabilities, and of course for his constituents in Calgary Centre. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities does not have what it takes to be minister. EOS BOS A minister must listen to people, and be receptive and empathetic. EOS BOS The minister clearly does not get this, and has repeatedly acted inappropriately and made condescending comments to Canadians, like Kim Davis. EOS BOS What is worse is that the minister ordered his staff to publicly humiliate Ms. Davis. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister endorse his minister's actions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities has addressed these allegations. EOS BOS He is working on important legislation to increase accessibility in order to help every disabled Canadian. EOS BOS When he was the minister of veterans' affairs, he delivered on our commitment to increase the caregiver recognition benefit, and he re-opened offices across the country that had been closed by the Conservatives. EOS BOS He will continue to be a passionate advocate for persons with disabilities and for his constituents in Calgary Centre. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is an alarming pattern but a clear one: the Liberals are compassionate toward vulnerable Canadians only when it is politically convenient for them. EOS BOS Thalidomide survivors, veterans' families, and sick mothers, who have all gone to a minister for assistance, have been dismissed and belittled. EOS BOS It gets worse. EOS BOS For his own political damage control, it seems he told his staff to publicly humiliate and discredit the wife of a sick veteran by sending screen shots of her personal Facebook posts to the media. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister condone his minister's words and actions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has responded to these allegations. EOS BOS He continues to work on important measures that are going to make Canada more accessible and ease the challenges facing Canadians living with disabilities. EOS BOS When he was veterans affairs minister, he made historic improvements to support veterans and their families and will continue to be a strong voice for the compassionate approach this government continues to have. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, over the past year, hundreds of women have had the courage to speak out against the harassment and violence they have suffered. EOS BOS These are systemic problems that require a political solution. EOS BOS For years, women's groups have been calling for a national action plan and investment in more shelter spaces. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us when, and I mean when, the government will listen to these women and come up with an action plan to finally stop this scourge? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for her passion on this issue. EOS BOS I am extremely proud to lead the development of a federal gender-based violence strategy. EOS BOS I am working closely with my provincial and territorial colleagues right now, consulting with NGOs who have spent a great amount of time working on and exploring this issue, and we should have something to talk about near June. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has stated that the infrastructure bank will shield taxpayers from risk, but let us be clear: Taxpayers are funding the bank, taxpayers will be paying the profits to private investors through user fees and tolls, and the minister is guaranteeing loans using taxpayer dollars. EOS BOS All of this additional risk is on the backs of taxpayers. EOS BOS Will the minister admit that the only people being shielded from risk are the private investors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have often stated in the House, the bank is designed to shift the risk to the private sector, with appropriate investments that the private sector will make in any given project. EOS BOS We will make sure that the experts who will be running the bank ensure that the public interest is always protected and that public dollars are always protected. EOS BOS Our goal is to make sure we are building the infrastructure that our communities need to grow our economy and create jobs for the middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, P3 Canada has been leveraging private sector dollars for infrastructure since 2009. EOS BOS Six billion dollars has been leveraged from an initial investment of $1.3 billion. EOS BOS A $35-billion investment into P3Canada would leverage $170 billion, all without guaranteeing private sector loans with taxpayer dollars. EOS BOS An internal report from KPMG recommended using P3 Canada's existing structure for the bank. EOS BOS Will the minister reverse this decision for the bank and invest in P3 Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, P3s will continue to play a dominant role in building infrastructure, and we support that. EOS BOS We are allowing municipalities to make their own decisions. EOS BOS We do not impose a certain procurement model on our partners. EOS BOS It is their decision. EOS BOS As well, the PPP Canada organization has supported the creation of the Canada infrastructure bank, because it sees that both complement each other to build the infrastructure that is required by Canadian communities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what do the former parliamentary budget officer, the former president of the Business Development Bank, the Quebec National Assembly, KPMG's internal report, and all members on this side of the House have in common? EOS BOS They have all spoken out against the infrastructure bank. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister and the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities finally make the right decision and remove the infrastructure bank from Bill C-44? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, very reputable Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, teachers, OMERS, Caisse de dépôt, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation, invest in international infrastructure. EOS BOS They invest in infrastructure in other countries. EOS BOS We want to create conditions so that our own pension funds that manage money on behalf of Canadians can invest in our own country to build the needed infrastructure and create jobs for Canadians. EOS BOS What is wrong with that? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is really unfortunate to see how stubborn the government and the minister are being about this. EOS BOS Even though everyone is warning them not to do it, they are headed for disaster. EOS BOS Who is going to pay for this? EOS BOS Who is going to contribute the $35 billion? EOS BOS It is going to come directly out of taxpayers' pockets. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister finally listen to the parliamentarians on this side of the House or will the Senate once again have to give the government a reality check? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, during the process to create the Canada infrastructure bank, we consulted extensively with municipalities, provinces, stakeholders, and investors. EOS BOS We all understand that in order to mobilize private capital, in order to build the infrastructure, we need to create a governance structure, an arm's-length crown corporation, accountable to the government through Parliament to the people of Canada. EOS BOS We want to undertake projects that will serve the public interest and the public good. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member says that the infrastructure bank will be arm's length, but that arm will be long enough to reach into the pockets of taxpayers. EOS BOS In fact, it will be long enough to reach into their pockets for projects that are already financed by the private sector. EOS BOS Former Liberal minister, Sergio Marchi, now lobbying for power companies, wants loan guarantees from taxpayers to build projects that are already built by the private sector. EOS BOS Will the government admit that this is not about increasing private involvement, but rather putting private profit on the backs of public risk? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have put forward a very ambitious, bold plan to build Canadian community infrastructure, tripling the investment compared to the previous government's meagre commitment to building infrastructure. 
              We understand that if we mobilize private capital, we can undertake projects that would never get built. EOS BOS That is the vision we have, and that is exactly what we want to do by mobilizing our pension funds to invest in our own country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a Canadian citizen, Sun Qian, has been imprisoned in Beijing for her belief in truth, compassion, and tolerance. EOS BOS Canada's new ambassador to China refused to publicly protest this latest case of Chinese extrajudicial detention, but by muting content on the plight of dual citizens unjustly held in China, Iran, Turkey, or any other undemocratic country, Canada is treating these citizens as second-class citizens. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals prioritizing trade and muting Canada's principled voice on the rule of law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a very important matter for us. EOS BOS However, I want to remind the hon. EOS BOS member of our Prime Minister's repeated confirmation that a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian. EOS BOS Unlike the previous government, we have never shied away from defending our Canadian citizens abroad. EOS BOS Consular services are being provided to all citizens who are in need. EOS BOS We are seized by this particular matter that the hon. EOS BOS member has raised. EOS BOS We are providing assistance to the family and we will continue to advocate for our citizens abroad. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, more slogans. EOS BOS For 15 months, the Liberals have been repeating ad nauseam that they want a softwood lumber agreement, but not just any agreement. EOS BOS So far there is no agreement, but now there is a task force that will start thinking about an agreement. EOS BOS Seriously. EOS BOS For 15 months now, the Liberals have done absolutely nothing for the 200,000 Canadians who work hard in our forestry industry. EOS BOS The Liberal champion of softwood lumber, the Minister of Natural Resources, was never allowed to cross the border to defend his honour. EOS BOS Will the minister take his work seriously and finally deliver a new agreement? EOS BOS When will we have a real Minister of Natural Resources instead of just any minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would remind members of the House that the former Conservative government allowed the agreement to lapse. EOS BOS Our government is vigorously defending the interests of Canadian softwood lumber workers and producers. EOS BOS We have a two-pronged approach, and the Minister of Natural Resources has announced the creation of a federal-provincial task force. We will continue our discussions with the United States, just as the Prime Minister did last week in Washington and yesterday by telephone. EOS BOS We are looking for a good agreement, and not just any agreement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has already misled Canadians once when he said that our allies were A-okay with us pulling out of the fight against ISIS. EOS BOS We know now that just was not true. EOS BOS It is clear he is doing it again when he says that the U.S. was consulted and gave the green light to Canada selling defence technology to the Chinese. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister just admit the U.S. was not happy about this sale, but he did not care and so he approved it anyway? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have enormous confidence in our national security agencies to do their work properly. EOS BOS They examine all the relevant facts, follow the process, and make thoughtful recommendations. EOS BOS They made a recommendation and we followed that recommendation. EOS BOS We followed their advice. EOS BOS This is exactly the multi-step review process that exists under the Investment Canada Act. EOS BOS We never have and we never will compromise on national security. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said that the U.S. had been consulted, but if it had been consulted, would our ambassador on the ground in Washington not have known about it? EOS BOS He did not seem to know about it and now the Prime Minister has put our ambassador in a very difficult situation. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister so intent on appeasing China that he is willing to not only put the safety and security of Canadians at risk, but also jeopardize the important relationship we have with our closest ally, friend, and trading partner, the United States? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been very clear that we have followed the process under the Investment Canada Act. EOS BOS All transactions are subject to a national security review. EOS BOS However, more broadly, we are focused on the economy, and we are focused on investments coming to Canada, which is why, in the first quarter, we saw growth up by 3.7%. EOS BOS It is why, since we formed government, the unemployment rate has gone from 7.1% to 6.6%, which is 250,000 good-quality full-time jobs over the past six months. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a report published by the Institut de la statistique du Québec says that many regions are emptying out to the detriment of the major centres. EOS BOS Our regions are important and so are the people who live there. EOS BOS We need to put tools in place to help SMEs grow and prosper. EOS BOS That's because our regions can create jobs and become more appealing to people that way. EOS BOS We need to support them. EOS BOS What does the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development intend to do so that Quebec's regions finally feel as though this government cares about them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our regional economic development agencies are very important to the government and our plan for innovation. EOS BOS They are part of our plan to ensure that jobs are created in every region of Canada. EOS BOS These will be good, export-oriented, innovation-based jobs. EOS BOS That is why all members of the House will show their support for our regional economic development agencies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, business owners are worried about what will be in the budget to be tabled on March 22.The Canadian Federation of Independent Business doubts that the government wants to give our businesses some breathing room by implementing tax breaks. EOS BOS The best way to develop wealth and create jobs is to stop stifling our businesses. EOS BOS Can the government reconsider its plan to make businesses owners fund its astronomical deficit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government understands the importance of small and medium-size businesses. EOS BOS We understand that they represent over 90% of the businesses in this country and contribute to over 40% of the GDP. EOS BOS That is why we are proud to deliver on our platform of reducing taxes for small businesses. EOS BOS As my minister said earlier in the week, watch for the budget and the details will be there. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the clouds are looking darker and darker on the other side. EOS BOS [English]The Panama papers gave us a glimpse into the troubling world of tax havens, and new reports raise questions about the Canada Revenue Agency's failure to act. EOS BOS A senior CRA employee crossed the floor to work for KPMG while the company was under investigation for setting up a tax sham. EOS BOS Why does the minister continue to defend the secret sweetheart deal for wealthy KPMG clients? EOS BOS How can Canadians take them seriously? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a right to be outraged. EOS BOS Our government recognizes that international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance are critical issues. EOS BOS We are taking meaningful action. EOS BOS The government has allocated more than $444 million to the CRA, to combat tax evasion and tax havens. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, people are outraged about the Panama papers. EOS BOS Multinational companies and people with connections are taking advantage of laws that were made for them, in order to shirk their responsibilities. EOS BOS The minister announced new measures, but there is no word on her former executive who jumped ship to go work for KPMG, at the same time that the firm was being investigated by the CRA. EOS BOS What a joke. EOS BOS Why does the minister keep defending the secret agreement for cheats? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there have long been post-employment restrictions at the Canada Revenue Agency for executives who leave the organization. EOS BOS In March 2014, the post-employment restrictions were extended to all employees who leave the Canada Revenue Agency. EOS BOS It would be inappropriate to comment on a specific case for reasons of privacy. EOS BOS Hon. EOS BOS members can rest assured that we are following this situation at the CRA very closely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at the time, the Minister of Justice was on the same side as the Assembly of First Nations in the fight to put an end to systemic discrimination against first nations children. EOS BOS One has to wonder what happened between October 19 and 20, 2015, because the minister is now unrecognizable. EOS BOS I am giving her another chance to do something other than adopt the old, woefully unacceptable plan presented by Stephen Harper. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us whether her government intends to fulfill its legal obligation to first nations children? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada is committed to reviewing the services offered to children and families on reserves and working with first nations to reform those services. EOS BOS We know that the system is broken, as illustrated by the damning report issued by the British Columbia Representative for Children and Youth. EOS BOS We must take into account the comments of young people when transforming the system and incorporate their experiences into any new approach. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to Cindy Blackstock, the Liberal government shortchanges first nations students by $130 million this year in foster care under Harper's plan. EOS BOS On education, the Prime Minister promised $2.6 billion over four years to first nations students. EOS BOS An INAC document showed the minister was given the plan to follow through on this promise, but the Liberals once again decided to pull the football out from under first nations children. EOS BOS They stretched that promise past the next election, shortchanging children by $800 million. EOS BOS When it comes to priorities, why squeeze money from children suffering under this broken system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member will recognize that the document was dated the day after we were sworn in. EOS BOS First nations deserve the best start in life, and this begins with properly funding education. EOS BOS That is why budget 2016 provided $3.7 billion over five years for kindergarten to grade 12 first nations, which includes providing $824.1 million to implement first nations-led transformation in education and 118 school-related infrastructure programs. EOS BOS We will work nation to nation to ensure the goals set by first nations are achieved and first nations-led initiatives are supported. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Canadian Transportation Agency concluded that compensation offered to Air Canada customers bumped from overbooked flights is insufficient. EOS BOS That compensation would have been sufficient if the Conservatives had supported Bill C-459.Why do the Conservatives feel that Canadian passengers do not deserve the same protection as Europeans and Americans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's airline industry is based on a user-pay principle. EOS BOS Other countries have chosen different options, but here, people who use the air transportation system pay for its services. EOS BOS We have excellent airline service in our country. EOS BOS We will continue to support airlines across the country by putting in place infrastructure, security measures and regulations that allow them to run a successful business. EOS BOS Our system operates on a user-pay principle. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has a lot at stake with our relationship with the United States, and Canadians are worried. EOS BOS While the U.S. is lowering taxes, the Prime Minister is raising them in Canada. EOS BOS That is what happens when there is a spending problem. EOS BOS There is nothing left when an emergency happens. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister stop raising taxes on our businesses so they can compete with the Americans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our record on taxes is quite clear. EOS BOS We have lowered taxes on middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS It was the very first thing we did. EOS BOS We know that helping middle-class Canadians is critically important to the future of this country. EOS BOS That is why we moved forward with that tax reduction. EOS BOS That is why we moved forward with the Canada child benefit, which helps nine out of 10 families. EOS BOS We also know that keeping a competitive tax rate for business is important, and that is the continuing focus of our government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is only one thing that is clear about taxes in our country, and that is that they are going up. 
              We know EOS BOS the President says that he wants to tweak NAFTA. EOS BOS We do not know quite what that means yet, but we do know he has plans to lower taxes and cut regulations. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister name one single economic policy that he has changed since the election of President Trump to protect our economy from Trump's low-tax agenda? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this past Monday was a very important day for Canada and for Canadians. EOS BOS We recognize the importance of our economic relationship with the United States, the importance for jobs, the importance for economic growth on both sides of the border. EOS BOS We expressed to the Americans our willingness to work together in terms of making sure our trade relationship improved over time, so we could help middle-class Canadians and middle-class Americans with good, well-paying jobs for tomorrow, which would be better for both of our economies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is spending a lot more money than he said he would. EOS BOS He promised to borrow only $10 billion a year and to balance the budget by 2019. EOS BOS Now, at the rate he is spending, he will not balance the books for 30 years, and he is raising taxes on Canadians to pay for all of this. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister understand that all this borrowing has to be paid back by hard-working Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we recognize that in order to create good-paying jobs for middle-class Canadians, we have to have an economy that is working. EOS BOS We know that making investments in our economy is critically important. EOS BOS What we have seen over the last year, since December 2015, is 277,300 new jobs in our economy. EOS BOS In January, we saw our unemployment rate decline from 6.9% to 6.8%. EOS BOS We are making investments in our economy to help middle-class Canadians today and tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Day, Canadians across the country will take time to remember the sacrifices made by those who selflessly served our country in defence of our core values and freedoms. EOS BOS Canadians from coast to coast to coast will visit war memorials on November 11 and pay their respects to Canada's fallen soldiers. EOS BOS These war memorials are sacred ground and should be treated with the utmost respect. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Veterans Affairs update the House on the government's support for our war memorials? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our Canadian war memorials should be treated with the utmost respect. EOS BOS That is why yesterday our government's members supported Bill C-217, an act to protect war memorials and cenotaphs in Canada, rightly brought forward by the member for Dufferin—Caledon. EOS BOS [Translation]I would have liked the New Democrat members to set aside their ideology out of respect for our fallen soldiers. EOS BOS [English]Unfortunately, the NDP voted against the bill. EOS BOS They voted against penalties for those who intentionally defile permanent tributes to Canada's fallen heroes. EOS BOS Veterans and the fallen deserve better from elected members. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Commissioner of Official Languages was very clear in his report. EOS BOS The Conservatives' record since 2006 has been catastrophic. EOS BOS People cannot get service in the language of their choice in airports. EOS BOS The government got rid of the census long form, closed the only bilingual rescue centre, appointed unilingual officers, and the list goes on. EOS BOS What will the new minister do to get Canada moving forward instead of backward on official languages? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the commissioner for his annual report. EOS BOS To set the record straight on what my colleague just said, I would like to quote from the commissioner's report: The federal government supports official language communities through various initiatives.... EOS BOS These initiatives have enabled a number of English-speaking and French-speaking communities to gain momentum over the years, giving them reason to be optimistic about the future. EOS BOS I am very proud of our government because we have made unprecedented investments in our national languages EOS BOS . We will continue to do just that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that funding for official languages is going down under the Conservatives. EOS BOS It is a bit rich that the minister forgot to mention that. EOS BOS These service cuts have a dramatic impact on our minority communities, and bilingualism rates are dropping across the country. EOS BOS Our official languages are a critical part of who we are as a country. EOS BOS The minister must do better, so will she implement the commissioner's recommendations, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the commissioner was very clear about this government's moving forward on official languages. EOS BOS I would like to say that he noted several positive developments, including that there are now half a million more bilingual Canadians than there were 10 years ago, the majority of Canada's provincial premiers are bilingual, and French has actually become, as he states, the language of ambition. EOS BOS We believe it is ambitious. EOS BOS I want to thank and congratulate all members of Parliament and senators who are presently taking official language training. EOS BOS Congratulations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, women who have undergone female genital mutilation suffer infections, difficult urination and childbirth, pain during intercourse, and more. EOS BOS Practitioners of FGM are entering Canada, and Canadian girls are being taken abroad to have the procedure performed on them. EOS BOS Raising awareness of FGM is a core part of the fight against it, and that is why it is listed in Canada's citizenship guide as a practice Canada does not tolerate. EOS BOS I have a simple question: Will the Prime Minister end his consultations on FGM and decide today that warnings about FGM belong in Canada's citizenship guide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, being vocal about this important issue is something I have always done. EOS BOS Indeed, when I was last in west Africa, I actually spoke up clearly and strongly against this issue. EOS BOS In regard to the citizenship guide, we are pleased to take recommendations and suggestions from all Canadians, including members of the opposition. I can assure members that we will be very clear about this issue, because this is not an issue for partisanship; this is an issue on which we are all united. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day indeed. EOS BOS This morning the NDP member for Hamilton Mountain attempted to explain why the NDP voted against helping parents when their child was murdered, missing or critically ill. EOS BOS I cannot imagine how any party could stand in this place and vote against such an important measure that would help families going through hard and tragic times. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources please comment on this issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the excuses of the NDP members will not stand up for voting against this measure. EOS BOS It is simply shameful that they want to vote against EI benefits for parents of missing children and on the other hand impose a carbon tax that would tax Canadians over $21 billion. EOS BOS Why does the NDP want to force parents to stay at work when their child has been kidnapped? EOS BOS Why does the NDP not support families in the toughest times they face? EOS BOS I have met these parents in the emergency department. EOS BOS These are parents who want to be with their children. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals promised during the election to fix the NEB's broken review of the Kinder Morgan pipeline, but instead they just added a smokescreen to the gutted Conservative review process. EOS BOS Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and B.C. first nation leaders from Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations are in Ottawa today sounding the alarm on the Liberals' flawed environmental review process. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister really planning to dismiss their concerns as easily as he broke his promise to British Columbians on the Kinder Morgan pipeline review? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure on January 27, with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, to announce a new set of rules in order to re-establish some kind of Canadian confidence in the regulatory system that, unfortunately, was broken after the last 10 years. EOS BOS We have added time for a panel of three distinguished western Canadians to hear the concerns of the mayor of Vancouver, the mayor of Calgary, and indigenous communities up and down the line, so at the end people will say, “ EOS BOS We have confidence in the regulatory process.” EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government seems to have forgotten the reality for remote, indigenous, and rural communities. EOS BOS Their food comes in by boat, by plane, and by ice road, and many of the communities use diesel-powered generators to keep the lights on. EOS BOS Communities that can least afford it are the ones that are going to be most impacted by this carbon tax. EOS BOS How can the government justify raising the high cost of living that is already there for our rural and remote communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the work that our government has done with indigenous people, with northern peoples. EOS BOS On Monday, I had the opportunity to hear representatives from the Inuit organization as well as other indigenous and Métis organizations. EOS BOS We are committed to working with our northern peoples, with indigenous peoples, because they are the most impacted by climate change. EOS BOS That is why we are very excited today that we are actually taking action. EOS BOS I expect that the party opposite, which is so concerned about the plight of indigenous and northern people, will support the Paris agreement in tonight's vote. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals talk about improving the lives of indigenous Canadians, but their actions are telling a very different story. EOS BOS They do not realize that food costs are already double in the north. EOS BOS A loaf of bread and a litre of milk cost double what we pay down here. EOS BOS This new tax is going to find its way into everything they buy every day. EOS BOS I have a more simple question. EOS BOS Have the Liberals done their homework, and will they table the costs that this will create for every indigenous community in this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have heard very poignantly about the high cost of living in the north. EOS BOS Just this week we heard from indigenous leaders, from Inuit leaders, who talked about how we need to tackle climate change, how we need to take action to protect their future, and how we need to be mindful of the circumstances in the north. EOS BOS Our government has made the commitment. EOS BOS If the party members opposite would like to read the Vancouver declaration, which we are supporting in tonight's vote, they would see it is very clear that we recognize the conditions of indigenous people and northern people. EOS BOS Once again, I hope they will support tonight's motion and vote in favour of the Paris agreement and the Vancouver declaration. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, industries like Entropex in my riding are closing, and others like CF Industries are already cancelling their expansions as a result of the Ontario Liberal carbon tax. EOS BOS Nova Chemicals is considering moving a $2 billion polyethylene project to the gulf coast where there are no job-killing carbon taxes. EOS BOS This additional federal carbon tax and the uncertainty around it will keep new businesses from choosing to do business here. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop taking jobs away from everyday Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member opposite for her passion in supporting business. EOS BOS If she really wants to support business, she should understand that the environment and the economy come together, and that is what we are doing. EOS BOS Let us go back to job creators— EOS BOS job creators like the Royal Bank, Tembec, Loblaws, Desjardins, Telus, the Aluminum Association of Canada, as well as other businesses. EOS BOS They have supported our plan to put a price on pollution because they recognize that is how we are going to create good jobs, how we are going to foster innovation, and how we are going to create the economy of the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, jobs in my riding are being put at risk by the Liberal carbon tax. EOS BOS More than a third of families in my riding depend on jobs in the energy industry to put food on their table. EOS BOS What does the Prime Minister have to say to hard-working mums and dads who are seeing their neighbours' jobs eliminated and thinking they are next? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, I would like to emphasize that our government understands that the only way to grow the economy is to do it in a sustainable way. EOS BOS That is why we are moving forward on what Canadians expect, a climate plan, while at the same time positioning ourselves so that we grow our economy, create clean jobs, and prepare ourselves for the future. EOS BOS Once again, do not listen to me; listen to the— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS member: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Members know that they should listen and not make noise when someone is speaking, even if they say that. EOS BOS Order. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, how about the parties opposite listen to the job creators they care so much about?Job creators are calling on Canada to put a price on carbon emissions, as most of the world's biggest economies are doing. EOS BOS It is the most economically effective way to reduce emissions and stimulate clean innovation, and will be critical to Canada's success in a changing global economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Kathryn Spirit is going to cost taxpayers $24 million. EOS BOS Most of the money will go to the company that dumped this eyesore in Beauharnois in the first place. EOS BOS To make matters worse, the government has not established a penalty in case the company fails to meet the dismantling deadline in early 2019. EOS BOS The cherry on top is that this company has been fined by Quebec for committing environmental violations. EOS BOS It is also facing a $10-million class action lawsuit. EOS BOS How does this government plan to impose strict environmental regulations, and why is there no late penalty, given that the dismantling is already six years overdue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to protecting the health and safety of Canadians and of our waters. EOS BOS We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the permanent removal of the Kathryn Spirit is carried out safely and efficiently. EOS BOS The contract to fully dismantle the Kathyn Spirit was awarded after an open and transparent procurement process. EOS BOS We are still monitoring the ship and will continue to keep the local community informed as the work progresses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have just witnessed the annual ritual of some of the world's worst human rights abusers elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council. EOS BOS The good news is that Russia has been denied the seat it so long took for granted. EOS BOS However, China, Saudi Arabia, and Cuba will be seated. EOS BOS The vote, as usual, was secret. EOS BOS However, the vote is not the minister's. EOS BOS It belongs to all Canadians. EOS BOS Will the minister tell Canadians how Canada voted on these four notorious human rights abusing nations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that we seek to maximize membership on this council with countries that have strong human rights records at home and abroad, and that this council, as everywhere, will promote universal human rights, as we have done over the last year with the greatest of results. EOS BOS This government asked for clemency in all cases of Canadians facing execution abroad. EOS BOS We will adopt the optional protocol to the convention against torture of the United Nations and a lot of— EOS
BOS The hon. member for Thornhill. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, some weeks ago, former Liberal justice minister and human rights champion Irwin Cotler, among others, called on the minister to defy the UN's secretive and hypocritical tradition and make Canada's vote public. EOS BOS The minister refused, as he did again today. EOS BOS We recognize the Liberals' willingness to mute Canada's principled voice in their shameless quest for a security council seat, but will the minister, today, reconsider, demonstrate leadership on the human rights file, and tell Canadians how Canada voted on Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, and Cuba? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to comment on the impressive record we have with respect to the promotion of human rights over the last year. EOS BOS We created the  office of human rights, freedoms, and inclusion. EOS BOS We are supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with a contribution of $15 million in new base funding. EOS BOS Canada has been elected to the Commission on the Status of Women of the United Nations. EOS BOS Human rights, freedoms and inclusion are now among the fundamental objectives of all Canadian heads of missions. EOS BOS We have tabled new legislation to guarantee and protect the legal rights and— EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Selkirk— EOS BOS Interlake—Eastman. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is too ashamed to admit how he voted at the UN.Yesterday, we learned the defence minister is making another trip to Africa. EOS BOS It seems the Liberals are hell-bent on sending 600 Canadian troops into harm's way. EOS BOS Before the minister sends our troops anywhere, he should explain to Canadians what interest we have in sending troops to Mali where 100 peacekeepers have already been killed. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister admit that sending troops to Mali serves no Canadian interests, other than his own vain campaign to win himself a seat at the UN Security Council? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last summer I had the opportunity to travel to five different countries in Africa, where I was able to take Canadians to understand the conflicts within those nations. EOS BOS While Canada has a responsible part to play in this world in conflict prevention and conflict reduction, this is another trip that I will be taking to Africa to learn more and work with my colleagues in a whole-of-government approach to peace operations, which I look forward to sharing with Canadians and all parliamentarians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the minister is going to visit Mali, where the government is preparing to send our troops. EOS BOS As a former commander of this type of infantry, I am well aware of the risks associated with the different missions. EOS BOS I would like to remind the House that, this year alone, this mission has cost over 32 peacekeepers their lives, bringing the total number of casualties up to 100.If the minister discovers that the mission is too dangerous for our troops and that it does nothing serve our national interests, will he stand up to the Prime Minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we look at all aspects of conflict in Africa, we will be selecting a place where Canada can make a meaningful contribution. EOS BOS Our Canadian Armed Forces have participated in UN peacekeeping operations around the world and we have been recognized for it. EOS BOS Canada has a role to play in conflict reduction and conflict prevention, and we have a responsibility to the world to be a responsible partner. EOS BOS We will bring a whole-of-government approach to this and I look forward to sharing this with all parliamentarians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during her testimony to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the Minister of Science told the committee that when she was at the G7 in Italy, Canada was viewed as a beacon for science around the world. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister update the House on the actions he is taking to ensure that Canada remains a top destination for international talent and how that is benefiting post-secondary institutions in Canada, but especially in my home province of British Columbia? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his advocacy on behalf of his constituents and his province. EOS BOS Our government's support for research and innovation is being noticed around the world. EOS BOS Through our investment of $117 million in the Canada 150 research chairs program, we are recruiting talented researchers and scholars from a broad variety of disciplines. EOS BOS Today the Minister of Science welcomed our first group of talented researchers, including Dr. Addis, Dr. Colijn, Dr. Ramalho-Santos, and Dr. Seltzer, who will work in Ontario and in British Columbia. EOS BOS We look forward to welcoming additional chairs in the coming months. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the Champlain Bridge saga, the Minister of Infrastructure refuses to give the Government of Quebec its fair share of the new $4 billion discretionary fund, which would help cover the cost of the LRT that Greater Montreal is looking for. EOS BOS The minister claims that it is not a discretionary fund since the projects will be selected on merit. EOS BOS However, with no regional distribution or any known criteria, it looks an awful lot like a discretionary fund. EOS BOS Quebec has found a project with merit: the LRT. EOS BOS The minister must commit to giving Quebec its share of the new fund for the Champlain Bridge. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that under the building Canada plan, which expires on March 31, 2014—it is still in effect—a number of provinces made public transit one of their priorities when choosing the investments to make from these envelopes. EOS BOS In Quebec, 9% of the envelope was devoted to public transit, while the other provinces invested up to 70% or more in public transit. EOS BOS The Province of Quebec already knows roughly how much money it will get as part of the transfers to the provinces. EOS BOS It is free to choose to make public transit a priority in the next infrastructure plan. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, residents of Yamachiche want clear answers to explain why two-metre waves damaged their homes. EOS BOS Damage could run into the thousands of dollars and someone has to be held responsible. EOS BOS The Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard says that an investigation is under way. EOS BOS However, the Minister of Transport will not confirm that. EOS BOS Can someone tell us in no uncertain terms whether an investigation has been launched? EOS BOS If so, what is the timeline and when will the results be made public? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for the question. EOS BOS Our government recognizes the importance of safe and environmentally sound navigation. EOS BOS We are aware of the situation in Yamachiche and can confirm that we have received complaints about this incident. EOS BOS We are currently assessing the factors that may have contributed to this incident. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. EOS BOS While touring my riding, I heard concerns from many constituents about the high cost of living in Nunavut. EOS BOS Food, equipment, and transportation are all extremely expensive, and we rely heavily on air transport for our goods and services. EOS BOS Transport Canada has proposed new regulations affecting duty time that could make airline operations and our cost of living even more expensive. EOS BOS When finalizing these regulations, will the minister take into account our unique circumstances and consider the impact these changes will have on northern airlines and Nunavummiut? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his continued advocacy for the people of Nunavut. EOS BOS I know he also supports improving aviation safety in Canada. EOS BOS We do recognize that the north relies heavily on air transport for the movement of passenger goods as well as essential services between communities. EOS BOS We are analyzing all the submissions as part of this review, including some that came from the north, and we will continue that conversation as we move forward. We understand. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to correct the record. I misspoke a moment ago. EOS BOS The unemployment rate represents the lowest rate of unemployment the country has seen in nine years. EOS BOS The 40% figure is actually the highest rate of job creation over the past year. EOS </s> BOS I believe that is debate, but thank you for the update. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last night, Canadians heard the grim news that yet another Canadian soldier has been lost to suicide. EOS BOS We all extend our heartfelt condolences to the grieving family of Corporal Scott Smith of CFB Gagetown. EOS BOS Corporal Smith is the 16th Canadian Forces member to die by suicide this year alone. EOS BOS When we have lost more soldiers to suicide than we did to the Taliban, we have a sacred obligation to ask why. EOS BOS When will the minister recognize the crisis in front of him and acknowledge that his government has not done nearly enough? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Corporal Scott Smith, which is dealing with this very tragic loss. EOS BOS This matter is under investigation. EOS BOS Any loss of a Canadian Armed Forces member is a tragedy that affects all of us right across the country. EOS BOS The Department of National Defence ensures that all members of the Canadian Armed Forces receive mental health support throughout their careers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister ignores the Auditor General, disregards veterans, and seems more interested in photo ops than in helping veterans. EOS BOS Now the Conservatives take money from General Dynamics, one of the world's biggest weapons manufacturers, to pay for our military mental health research. EOS BOS Do the Conservatives not understand that when our soldiers sign on the dotted line, for unlimited liability, to put their lives on the line, it is the government's sacred duty to provide proper care for them? EOS BOS Do they really not understand their duty to our nation's veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to providing the best possible care for our soldiers. EOS BOS These funds will help our soldiers and our veterans. EOS BOS I do not understand why the NDP and the opposition have a problem with that. EOS BOS The last thing we want to do is discourage private sector donations to hospitals like The Royal Ottawa mental health centre foundation. EOS BOS Unlike the Liberals and the NDP, I am going to take this opportunity to thank all our private sector partners for their commitment to supporting our armed forces through charitable giving. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the Conservatives are trying to save money at the expense of our soldiers and veterans, many of them are struggling with post-traumatic stress and some are even putting an end to their own lives. EOS BOS Yesterday, Corporal Scott Smith committed suicide in Gagetown. EOS BOS He is the 16th member of the Canadian Forces to take his own life this year. EOS BOS What will it take for the Conservatives to wake up and give our soldiers and veterans the support they need? EOS </s> BOS As I said, Mr. Speaker, this is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Corporal Scott Smith. EOS BOS This is an investigation that will be reported back in time. EOS BOS I would like to remind the House that our government has increased the annual mental health budget for the Canadian military by over 20%. EOS BOS We have added additional mental health workers. EOS BOS There are over 415 now. EOS BOS Most recently, we have provided additional support to the Canadian Institute for Military and Veterans Research for further mental health studies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are appalled by the grotesque videos now in the public domain, showing the abuse of young, mentally ill Ashley Smith while she was in federal custody. EOS BOS The scenes in the videos are an integral part of a lengthy tragedy of events that led to her death. EOS BOS The government has fought relentlessly to keep the videos secret and to limit any public examination to provincial matters only. EOS BOS Now that Canadians know what the government was hiding and are disgusted by it, will the government stop the charade, fully co-operate and allow the videos as evidence at the Ashley Smith inquest? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we all agree, some of the behaviour seen in these videos is absolutely unacceptable and reiterates what a very sad case this is. EOS BOS Our government has directed the Correctional Service of Canada to fully co-operate with the coroner's inquest. EOS BOS That is what we expect it to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, rail transportation is crucial to our economy, and provides us with an efficient system of moving people and goods through this great and vast country of ours. EOS BOS Nothing is more important than rail safety, which is paramount to users, to railway workers, and most of all, to all the communities across Canada that have rail lines passing through them. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport tell us what our government is doing to ensure that Canada has the strictest rail safety standards? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for Laurentides— EOS BOS Labelle for his question. EOS BOS Rail safety remains the minister's top priority. EOS BOS That is why we regularly review the Railway Safety Act to ensure that it reflects what the industry needs and what the population needs. EOS BOS We are very pleased to be able to begin this review one year earlier than planned, and we look forward to receiving the committee's recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, an American giant bought Rona, a Canadian company with 23,000 employees and many suppliers. EOS BOS At the same time, the government is signing the trans-Pacific partnership, an agreement that will cost us 60,000 good jobs, weaken family farms, and accelerate foreign control of our businesses. EOS BOS Why is the minister signing an agreement that is clearly bad for our jobs and our dairy farms? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for her question. EOS BOS As I just said, we are signing the agreement to give ourselves the time to have a parliamentary committee study it properly. EOS BOS Should we ratify the agreement, we will work with the sectors affected. EOS BOS That is a commitment we made during the election campaign, and that is exactly what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has agreed to compensate the provinces for the seniors who are forced to turn to social assistance as a result of the government's disastrous plan to change the age of eligibility for old age security to 67. EOS BOS Similarly, it must also agree to compensate the provinces for employment insurance, since its attack on seasonal workers will push many of them to social assistance. EOS BOS Will the provinces yet again be stuck with the bill for this government's anti-social policies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that could not be further from the truth. EOS BOS By helping people find longer-term jobs in their region and in their area of expertise, we hope that the provinces will see lower social assistance rates. EOS BOS That is our goal. EOS BOS There is a shortage of skilled workers across the country. EOS BOS That is why we are making an effort to connect people to jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while SMEs like the businesses in the Saint-Hubert Plaza are wondering what happened to the Liberals who promised them a lower tax rate, the wealthiest members of our society are still taking advantage of tax loopholes. EOS BOS The Liberals' flip-flop on their plan to increase taxes on stock options is yet more proof of the influence that rich lobbyists have on government policies, as if we did not have enough proof already. EOS BOS When will the Liberal government stop letting its millionaire friends call the shots and finally put an end to tax loopholes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that it is very important to have an efficient and fair tax system that works well for the middle class. EOS BOS That is why we cut taxes for the middle class. EOS BOS We also increased the tax rate for the wealthiest people in our country. EOS BOS It was the right thing to do. EOS BOS SMEs need a healthy economy. EOS BOS That is why we are investing in our economy so that SMEs and Canadians who are looking for work will have more opportunities available to them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as researcher Alain Deneault reminded us, when people have to wait 15 or 20 hours for emergency care, it is because of tax havens. EOS BOS When the subway keeps breaking down and there are not enough buses, it is because of tax havens. EOS BOS When there is not enough money to take care of our seniors, it is because of tax havens. EOS BOS This legalized tax scam is costing our country tens of billions of dollars. EOS BOS The wealthiest Canadians are sending their money to the Caribbean and are not paying any taxes in Canada. EOS BOS Will the Liberals crack down on this highway robbery? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to cracking down on tax havens to ensure that our fiscal system is fair and responsive to all Canadians. EOS BOS We know that middle-class Canadians work really hard and pay their fair share of taxes, but some wealthy individuals buy their way out by using sophisticated schemes. EOS BOS That is unacceptable, and it needs to change. EOS BOS That is why our government made an unprecedented investment of $444 million in CRA to bolster its capacity to fight tax evasion and tax avoidance here and abroad. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are tired of the current government's broken promises. EOS BOS My riding of Windsor—Tecumseh hoped the Prime Minister would deliver on promises for mail delivery, first nations, Bill C-51, and climate change. EOS BOS They were not the only ones. EOS BOS Canada's foremost environmentalist, David Suzuki, said the Prime Minister is “an out-and-out”, but then he uses a word that is unparliamentary but it means “misleading Canadians”. EOS BOS Will anyone on the Liberal benches stand up and demand that their government start practising what they used to preach? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased last year when the Prime Minister stood with the premiers from the provinces and territories to announce a climate plan. EOS BOS We are serious about taking action on climate change, because we know it is the right thing to do. EOS BOS It will also create good jobs, help grow the economy, and ensure a more sustainable future for our children. EOS
