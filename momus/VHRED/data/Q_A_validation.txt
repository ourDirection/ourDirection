BOS The trouble is, Mr. Speaker, that proposal just will not work, and the industry has told that to the government. EOS BOS The facts are that Canadian fruit and vegetable sellers have had long-standing protection under United States law. EOS BOS They no longer have that protection, as of October 1. EOS BOS As a result, Canadian jobs, Canadian farmers, and parts of our supply chain, are at serious risk. EOS BOS Industry has made it clear: it needs a Canadian-made perishable commodities act, and that is the only option to protect produce suppliers. EOS BOS Why not implement that viable option? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I met with the industry just last week. EOS BOS When the Safe Food for Canadians Act was before Parliament, one of the top requests from this sector of agriculture was that there be put in place legislation to provide a single dispute resolution body. EOS BOS That was done. EOS BOS That came before Parliament and it was passed. EOS BOS There are other possible solutions, and these were discussed at the meeting I had with industry representatives last week. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Constable David Wynn was shot and killed in the line of duty by a career criminal out on bail, because his criminal record was never presented at the bail hearing. EOS BOS Now there is a bill before the House that would close the bail loophole that cost Constable Wynn his life. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's cabinet would obviously have discussed it. EOS BOS Therefore, it was disturbing when the Prime Minister said at a town hall that he did not know anything about this bill. EOS BOS Now that he has had time to catch up with his work, will he instruct his caucus to support Wynn's law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Constable David Wynn and especially to his widow, Shelly MacInnis-Wynn.We are committed to ensuring an effective and efficient bail system. EOS BOS The Minister of Justice will continue to collaborate with the provinces and territories and consult stakeholders that use these important Criminal Code provisions every day. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like the Prime Minister to translate that back for me. EOS BOS This is a very simple change in the Criminal Code. EOS BOS This career criminal was out on bail, because his criminal record was never presented at the bail hearing. EOS BOS It is very simple. EOS BOS It is a small loophole that can be closed if this bill is passed. EOS BOS I appreciate the Prime Minister's words. EOS BOS They mean a lot to the family, I am sure, but what would mean even more is if he passes this bill. EOS BOS Will he say yes or no? EOS BOS Will he instruct his caucus to pass this bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would echo the words of the Prime Minister extending our deepest sympathies to the family of Constable Wynn. EOS BOS We are committed to conducting a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, including bail reform. EOS BOS That is why I continue to engage with my counterparts in the provinces and territories to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the justice system, ensuring we keep public safety top of our mind. EOS BOS Certainly, we agree with the objective of this legislation in terms of ensuring that information is made available to make necessary decisions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have another question for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS One of his Liberal members, the member for Beaches—East York, thinks that the Prime Minister is not going far enough when it comes to legalizing marijuana. EOS BOS He wants the Prime Minister to “decriminalize all drugs”. EOS BOS There is a good reason that all drugs are not legal, and that is because they ruin the lives of our loved ones. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister unequivocally denounce the comments that his Liberal colleague made and immediately commit to Canadian families that he will not put our youth at risk in legalizing tough, hard drugs like heroin and cocaine? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is committed to evidence-based policy, unlike the previous government. EOS BOS That is why we support safe consumption sites and want to do everything we can to protect Canadians from the ongoing opioid crisis. EOS BOS We have committed to legalizing marijuana, but we are not planning on legalizing anything else at this time. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on another subject, the chairman of the Conservative brain trust, the member for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound, at an interview that he gave to the Meaford Independent apparently has suggested that it is time for Canada to withdraw from the United Nations. EOS BOS I would like to ask the government House leader, has it really come to this on that side of the House? EOS BOS Has it really come to the point where the government is seriously contemplating withdrawing from the United Nations? EOS BOS Is that now the international policy of Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our foreign policy is a values-based foreign policy based on those fundamental values we share of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, values we seek to promote around the world, values that we have promoted through our participation in a United Nations-sanctioned mission in Afghanistan, where we have helped to advance those values that we have delivered on, and a United Nations-sanctioned mission in Libya led by a Canadian, Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard. EOS BOS We will continue to work to see that those values are advanced at every opportunity, including trying to see them more advanced at the United Nations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, no government in recent history has taken so long to fill watchdog vacancies as these Liberals. EOS BOS This should not come as a surprise as the Prime Minister is under investigation for multiple ethical transgressions. EOS BOS Between countless judicial vacancies and unfilled watchdog positions, the Liberals have once again proved to Canadians that they are only willing to green-light Liberal insiders and former chiefs of staff. EOS BOS Just yesterday, they appointed a Liberal donor to the superior court of P.E.I. The Liberals have proven once again the only families they are interested in looking after are their own. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to stand in this House to remind Canadians and to remind members that it is this government that introduced a new merit-based process that is open and transparent. EOS BOS Every position is available online. EOS BOS I encourage Canadians to apply. EOS BOS We have taken diversity, bilingualism, and gender parity into consideration when making these important decisions. EOS BOS We will continue to deliver for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is no shortage of examples of incompetence and mismanagement with this Prime Minister. EOS BOS Over a year ago, he said we urgently needed to fill a so-called capability gap and replace our Royal Canadian Air Force fighter fleet. EOS BOS However, instead of opening a bidding process to replace our 30-year-old fighter jets, he now wants to buy more 30-year-old fighter jets. EOS BOS Our military personnel need this new equipment now, not two elections from now. EOS BOS What is he waiting for? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that our military personnel needed these new fighter jets years ago. EOS BOS The Conservative government was unable to deliver the equipment that our forces needed. EOS BOS That is why we are launching an open and transparent process to replace our entire fleet of fighter jets. EOS BOS In the meantime, we will need interim jets to fulfill our NORAD and NATO responsibilities. EOS BOS That is a reality that the Conservative government left us to deal with. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is this Prime Minister who has changed the process so many times, and it is our men and women in the armed forces who are suffering for it. EOS BOS In 2012, Australia's auditor general identified numerous issues with the F/A-18 Hornets. EOS BOS They would require significant structural upgrades and repairs just to see service in Canada, and it is far more likely that we will spend billions of dollars just for spare parts. EOS BOS It is not just me who is questioning these decisions. EOS BOS Even the Australians cannot understand why we are buying their old planes rather than doing what they are doing, which is buying new planes. EOS BOS If the Prime Minister is so keen on buying fixer-uppers, will he come over, because I have an old minivan I would love to show him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians know that the previous Conservative government failed over the course of 10 years to give the men and women of our armed forces the equipment necessary to do their jobs. EOS BOS It so completely botched the fighter jet procurement—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. I know that the members are excited about used car sales, but I ask them each to take their turn, to listen when others have their turn, and to only speak when they have the floor. EOS BOS The right hon. EOS BOS Prime Minister has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the previous Conservative government made such a mess of buying the needed fighter jets that we can no longer meet our NORAD and NATO obligations, which is why we need an interim fleet replacement while we proceed to the open and transparent competition that it should have held almost a decade ago. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Job Bank operated by HRSDC has been shut down for two weeks. EOS BOS That is two weeks and still no resolution. EOS BOS Unemployed Canadians are trying to get back on their feet, but they are not getting the help that they need to get a job. EOS BOS The government is not serious about getting people back to work. EOS BOS There is no job creation strategy and now, no Job Bank. EOS BOS Why will the government not get serious and help unemployed Canadians get back to work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, our government's top priority is job creation and economic growth. EOS BOS Part of this is ensuring that Canadians do have the help they need to get the jobs. EOS BOS Unfortunately, there was a security issue with the Job Bank. EOS BOS It was identified and all the appropriate parties were notified, including the Privacy Commissioner. EOS BOS I can assure members that HRSDC officials are working around the clock so we can get the Job Bank back up and running in a secure way as quickly as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, people are looking for jobs; it is as simple as that. EOS BOS From employment insurance claims processing to the Job Bank, automation has been nothing but problematic. EOS BOS Unemployed workers need more. EOS BOS They need to get their employment insurance cheques quickly. EOS BOS They need to find new jobs using tools like the Job Bank. EOS BOS They need someone to answer the phone. EOS BOS Canadians pay for these services. EOS BOS Where are the services they have paid for and are entitled to? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Job Bank is being overhauled to enhance security and better meet the needs of unemployed Canadians. EOS BOS Officials in my department have assured me that they are working very hard to make the Job Bank more secure and more useful. EOS BOS We want to help people find work. EOS BOS That is why we are working so hard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Prime Minister stood in the House defending his decision to approve the sale of a piece of Canada's health care system to China, but he could not say exactly who owns this company. EOS BOS In addition to the time they have spent reviewing the approval, they have now had 24 hours to figure out who owns this company. EOS BOS Therefore, do they have an answer yet? EOS BOS Who owns Anbang Insurance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been very clear that investment is so critical for creating economic growth and jobs, particularly here in Canada. EOS BOS We look at all investments that come to Canada under the Investment Canada Act. EOS BOS With regard to this specific case, we did our due diligence, we looked at the job levels, and we made sure that we received good quality data around the jobs that would be secured, and also any additional resources for expansion of the facility to create new jobs. EOS BOS The bottom line is, this is good for British Columbia. EOS BOS This is good for Canadians. EOS BOS This is good for jobs, and this is good for the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the South African high commissioner spoke about the reports that Canada may be withdrawing from Kyoto. EOS BOS She called the move disturbing and disappointing. EOS BOS She said it will undermine the negotiating process at Durban because Canada has not only planned a withdrawal, but has actively lobbied other countries to do the same. EOS BOS The minister has admitted he has no intention to negotiate a new climate deal, and he has not denied his intention to withdraw from Kyoto. EOS BOS At the same time, the minister has said that his intentions in Durban are not to derail the negotiations on climate. EOS BOS Will the minister tell us what his intentions really are? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, instead of talking about intentions, let us talk about real action with regard to climate change: $250 million to support regulatory activities to address climate change and $86 million to support clean energy regulatory reforms. EOS BOS New Democrats voted against this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, why do I not take a crack at deciphering what the intentions are? EOS BOS We know that the Conservatives are waiting until December 23 to announce their withdrawal from Kyoto. EOS BOS If a country withdraws from the agreement, it does not take effect for one year. EOS BOS That means that Canada can try to sabotage the negotiations this year in Durban and next year in Qatar. EOS BOS It is this kind of behaviour that denigrates and undermines Canada's reputation internationally. EOS BOS Will the minister admit that this is his plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, agreements that do not include major emitters like China and the United States will not work. EOS BOS That is why we remain committed to reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. EOS BOS We are making good progress through tangible action that we have taken here at home. EOS BOS We are proud of this record. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, by neglecting the environment, this government is jeopardizing the health of our families and of the economy. EOS BOS The Conservatives are turning their backs on the international community so that they do not have to be accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS Reneging on their commitments to Canadians and other countries is a strategy that hurts everyone. EOS BOS Why is the government refusing to table a credible plan that takes the environment and the economy into account? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleague opposite has acknowledged a fundamental point. EOS BOS We need to balance our environment and the economy and this is what we are doing. EOS BOS This is a principle that the opposition would gladly throw to the wind when it denigrates our oil sands sector. EOS BOS Our government's sector-by-sector approach, which is being developed by a robust consultation process, is designed to meet a tangible target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, while being cognizant of Canada's economic growth. EOS BOS This approach is prudent and action focused and we are proud of it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after seeing the Conservatives drag their feet for six years, major trade partners are slamming doors in our face. EOS BOS They disapprove of the government's environmental choices. EOS BOS Not only are the Conservatives isolating us from the rest of the world, but their inaction is costing us jobs here in Canada. EOS BOS Why does this government refuse to understand that it is possible to create good-quality jobs while investing in clean energies, as our partners are doing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, $40 million for Sustainable Development Technology Canada was included in this year's budget. EOS BOS Again, our government is committed to clean energy and the New Democrats keep voting against measures to support it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a new year and a new minister, but employees of the Vegreville immigration case processing centre are still reeling. EOS BOS In response to my Order Paper question, the department said that closing the centre involved extensive consultation with another government department, but of course, not with the employees, the town, or local businesses. EOS BOS In fact, there was zero consultation with anyone who will actually be impacted. EOS BOS Will the new minister do what his predecessor refused to do, reverse this heartless decision and save these rural jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to let the member opposite know that I spoke to the mayor of Vegreville a few weeks ago. EOS BOS That is an example of outreach. EOS BOS That is an example of me letting the mayor tell me the concerns of the community. EOS BOS We are aware of the impacts on staff and families of this relocation. EOS BOS I want to assure the member opposite that all current employees in the Vegreville case processing centre will have their jobs in the new location. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians know that the infrastructure deficit in this country is significant and that governments need to be innovative in how they address this challenge. EOS BOS The proposed Canada infrastructure bank would be an additional tool to build new infrastructure by attracting private sector and institutional investors to support the transformational infrastructure Canadian communities need. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister update the House on the status of the creation of the infrastructure bank? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member for Pickering— EOS BOS Uxbridge is herself a former municipal councillor, so she understands how important it is to make investments in infrastructure that are going to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians. EOS BOS I am pleased that our government recently announced the launch of an open, transparent, and merit-based selection process to identify the bank's senior leadership. EOS BOS This process is designed to attract highly qualified individuals while taking into consideration the desire to achieve gender parity and to reflect Canada's linguistic, cultural, and regional diversity. EOS BOS We encourage all Canadians to apply and look forward to receiving many qualified applications. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we found out today that the government will be shutting down the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory, PEARL, on Ellesmere Island. EOS BOS After significant investment into this world-renowned atmospheric research station in the high Arctic, the Conservatives are slashing funding. EOS BOS Instead, they plan to open another one five years from now and in the wrong location. EOS BOS This is another example of the Conservatives' approach to science. EOS BOS Why does the government make decisions based on the whims of a Prime Minister, instead of listening to great Canadian scientists and their globally important research? EOS BOS When will the Conservatives get their heads out of the sand when it comes to the global climate crisis? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada recognizes the importance of university atmospheric research in the Arctic and has provided partial funding, along with a number of other bodies, since 2009 for the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory. EOS BOS However, the university research application to those other bodies for renewed funding, with support from Environment Canada, was not successful at the recent national centres of excellence competition. EOS BOS That said, Environment Canada will continue to monitor ozone and the atmosphere at Eureka. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one thing we do know is that with slower growth, inequality is only going to be increasing in the country. EOS BOS It poses a very serious challenge, particularly to those who are disabled. EOS BOS I have a very simple question for the government. EOS BOS The government has a disability tax credit, but it only applies to those people who are disabled and who have an income. EOS BOS Would the government consider making this income tax credit refundable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government has taken substantial efforts to encourage economic growth and substantial efforts to help those Canadians with a disability. EOS BOS For example, just with respect to inequality, this government has an EI hiring tax credit, the third quarter project, a youth employment strategy, an apprenticeship incentive grant. EOS BOS The Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development has a substantial amount of work going on. EOS BOS A report on Canadians with disabilities will be coming to her in very short order. EOS BOS We are certainly prepared to continuously do more to help Canadians with disabilities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one thing we know is that, with a significant slowdown in economic growth, inequality in our society is only going to get worse. EOS BOS This is a growing problem. EOS BOS Once again, I am asking the minister the question that he did not answer: why not make tax credits for people with disabilities refundable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government has taken substantial initiatives to help all Canadians who seek employment. EOS BOS We are particularly concerned, obviously, by those Canadians who are disabled and have trouble seeking employment. EOS BOS That is why this government has brought in a series of initiatives to try to specifically address the needs of Canadians with a disability. EOS BOS As I said, my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, has a report coming very shortly, which will outline even more advice to the government of what more we can do to help Canadians with a disability. EOS BOS We are going to continue to do even more. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a very simple fact that most of the tax credits that the government has introduced for all kinds of things, for sports equipment, piano lessons, whatever it may be, do not apply, are not refundable for people who do not have taxable income. EOS BOS There are millions of people who do not have taxable income, 9 million families. EOS BOS Why not make these tax credits refundable? EOS BOS In particular, why not make the tax credits refundable for those people with disabilities? EOS BOS It is a very simple and basic change and a very simple question. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government has brought forward a substantial number of tax reductions that help all Canadians, including those Canadians with a disability. EOS BOS Just before Parliament we have measures to improve registered disability savings plans. EOS BOS The Liberals are trying to delay those initiatives from being tackled. EOS BOS This government has brought forward the working income tax benefits. EOS BOS This government has brought forward substantial tax reductions. EOS BOS This government cuts taxes for Canadians who pay taxes, and that is, I guess, a fundamental difference from the Liberal Party. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the law says people cannot give a bunch of money to a political party on Monday and then ask for special treatment on Tuesday. EOS BOS That is why we have a five-year ban between fundraising and lobbying. EOS BOS However, the chairman of a pharmaceutical giant named Apotex held a $1,500-a-person fundraiser featuring the Prime Minister himself, and is now lobbying the Liberal government. EOS BOS Just so we are all clear, this is totally illegal. EOS BOS Do the Liberals actually think it is appropriate to have lobbying meetings with a pharmaceutical giant that has raised tens of thousands of dollars for the Liberal Party, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with respect to the previous fundraising activity, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has said that no rules were broken. EOS BOS That being said, we recognize that we can do more. EOS BOS That is why the Minister of Democratic Institutions will be introducing legislation to make political fundraising even more open and more transparent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is once again the subject of an ethics investigation. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Lobbying is going to be looking into the fundraiser that allegedly gave privileged access to the chairman of Apotex. EOS BOS We keep hearing that the Liberals obey the law. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Lobbying, however, believes something is amiss. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister really still believe that his government is a model of ethical behaviour? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Lobbying looks at activities of lobbyists. EOS BOS With respect to the recent fundraising activities, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has said that no rules were broken. EOS BOS That being said, we recognize that we can do more. EOS BOS That is why the Minister of Democratic Institutions will be introducing legislation to make political fundraising even more open and transparent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government keeps telling us that it is following the rules, but we all know the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and the Commissioner of Lobbying are constantly investigating its actions. EOS BOS This government promised to be the most ethical government ever, but it turns out to be not all that far removed from the party that gave us the sponsorship scandal. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister make claims about real change when he is once again being investigated for an ethical issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that the Commissioner of Lobbying monitors lobbyists' activities. EOS BOS Our government will continue to work very hard to address the real challenges Canadians are facing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are seeing a very disturbing pattern here with the Liberals. EOS BOS A giant pharmaceutical company or a billionaire with his own island, the Prime Minister is at their beck and call, even if it means breaking the law. EOS BOS However, for regular Canadians struggling to pay the bills, struggling to pay for those overpriced medicines, the Liberals are just not that into them. EOS BOS If the Liberals will crawl across broken glass to answer the phone of the wealthy and well connected, when are they going to work half as hard for average Canadians who are just trying to follow the law and pay the bills? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in regard to the comments that the member is making, and I am sure he also knows better, the Commissioner of Lobbying looks at activities of lobbyists. EOS BOS When it comes to everyday Canadians, it was this government that committed to working very hard for middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS That is why we reduced taxes on middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS That is why we introduced the Canada child benefit. EOS BOS We will continue to work hard for Canadians, because that is what they elected us to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at $550,000 a job, we can get two senators for that price. EOS BOS Not only would this 450-page omnibus bill continue the raid on employment insurance, it is packed full of other measures that Conservatives want to hide from Canadians, like the Conservative private member's bill to strip social security from refugee claimants to federal judges to airports, and the elimination of the Canadian Polar Commission, dozens of laws changed with a single stroke of a pen. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Finance answer just one question? EOS BOS What do any of these initiatives have to do with the budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our budget implementation plan goes to reducing taxes, creating jobs and economic growth, and there are many measures that would achieve that. EOS BOS It would extend the existing tax credit for interest paid on government-sponsored student loans and interest paid on a Canada apprentice loan. EOS BOS It introduces a new reporting standard to meet Canada's G8 commitment to increase transparency for entities operating in the extractive sector. EOS BOS It would strengthen Canada's intellectual property regime and amend legislation to implement reforms to the temporary foreign workers program. EOS BOS It would make the tax system fairer and simpler for farming and fishing businesses. EOS BOS It would do a great deal for the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Monday, after much effort to be heard, veteran Claude Lalancette finally resorted to a hunger strike on Parliament Hill to protest the military's use of mefloquine and its effects on our soldiers and sailors. EOS BOS Instead of giving him a concrete promise to address his concerns, the Liberals instead said they would set up yet another consultative process to study the issue. EOS BOS Why is the minister's reaction yet again a consultation delay tactic instead of action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member cares a great deal about veterans and only wants the best for them. EOS BOS The issue around mefloquine has been discussed over the years. EOS BOS We know inside Veterans Affairs, National Defence, and Health Canada that we need to work together to address the issue. EOS BOS We cannot comment on specific cases, but we now have a working group established that will work together on this issue and make sure that it is properly addressed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year the Prime Minister flew over to Europe and confidently announced “mission accomplished” for the trade deal with the European Union—Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS I think there may have been more. EOS BOS I think government members may have been a little early in applauding the question. EOS BOS I will ask them to hold off until the member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley is finished asking his question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they will have to hold their applause, because I am not done yet, and apparently neither is this trade deal. EOS BOS Almost a year ago, the Conservatives said it was just technicalities and a little legal scrubbing that was left to do. EOS BOS Unless the Conservatives think serious opposition from the German government's economy minister is a technicality, they have a problem. EOS BOS I have a simple question. EOS BOS Is the Prime Minister open to the changes from the German economy minister, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that today we found out that the new trade commissioner for the European Union, Cecilia Malmström, just said that the CETA, the trade agreement with the EU, is very good for the European Union and that the dispute settlement provisions in the agreement address the EU's concerns relating to transparency and its ability to regulate in the public interest. EOS BOS This agreement is going to add over 80,000 new jobs to the Canadian economy. EOS BOS That is equivalent to $1,000 in additional income for the average Canadian family every year. EOS BOS That is good news. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are essentially asking us to blindly accept a trade agreement without knowing all the details. EOS BOS More specifically, we still do not know anything about the government's strategy for compensating the sectors affected by the agreement with Europe. EOS BOS The Prime Minister and his friends can go ahead and pat themselves on the back, but entire sectors of the economy are waiting for an answer. EOS BOS For example, what compensation will be provided to cheese producers? EOS BOS What compensation will be provided to the provinces affected by the increased cost of drugs? EOS BOS When will Canadians have clear answers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is passing strange that the New Democrats would get up in the House and claim that they still want to have more information about the deal. EOS BOS A few months ago, they said they were waiting for the final text to be released to the public. EOS BOS We did that last week, and now we hear the same old anti-trade, anti-investment rhetoric. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we know how important new opportunities for trade are to our Canadian business people, our investors, and our consumers. EOS BOS On this side, we are getting things done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Prime Minister gave a group of European delegates the royal treatment after insisting that they join him at a reception in Toronto. EOS BOS They got to go back home on board an Airbus on the taxpayers' dime. EOS BOS The total cost of the operation was $300,000.At a time of budgetary restrictions and cuts to public services, how can the Prime Minister justify giving the royal treatment to leaders who clearly do not need it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this trade agreement is a historic one. EOS BOS In fact, last Friday's event saw the launch of a huge coalition of Canadian businesses and stakeholders who are committed to taking advantage of this historic agreement. EOS BOS The coalition represents hard-working Canadians across the country, from every region of our country and every sector of our economy. EOS BOS It should surprise no one that the New Democrats would want us to cancel the event. EOS BOS They wanted us to cancel this event because we know they are anti-trade, anti-investment and have no credibility on trade whatsoever. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the downside of the Prime Minister's very bad week was that it cost Canadian taxpayers half a million dollars for a photo op. EOS BOS The Conservatives tell us that there is no money for veterans offices, they cannot afford to deliver the mail, and 65-year-old miners cannot afford to retire, but they can take a couple of European bureaucrats and fly them across the ocean for a photo op. EOS BOS I would like the minister to tell us how much it cost for flights and security for this faux second signing of this trade deal. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, why would the opposition want us to cancel such a critical element of this event, the Canada-EU summit? EOS BOS We know that the NDP is anti-trade. EOS BOS Not once has it stood in the House and supported any one of the free trade agreements that Canada has ever signed. EOS BOS On this side of the House, in a short eight years, the government has signed free trade agreements with 38 different countries, and there are many more to come. EOS BOS On this side, we understand how important trade and investment are to driving economic growth and long-term prosperity in the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has become increasingly clear that Conservatives prefer to keep Canadians in the dark on how public money is being spent. EOS BOS The PBO analyzed the estimates and the cost of the war in Afghanistan and the F-35s. EOS BOS Instead of strengthening the PBO, Conservatives are making it weaker. EOS BOS Instead of welcoming oversight, Conservatives are hiding the numbers. EOS BOS Instead of being more transparent, why are Conservatives breaking their promises? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we have some very firm rules in this House about the delivery of estimates, public accounts and reports on plans and priorities, which are the accountability reports by the various departments of the Government of Canada. EOS BOS We adhere to those standards. EOS BOS We are pleased to share those. EOS BOS I tabled the estimates myself just over a week ago and we will continue to do so. EOS BOS Of course, the Parliamentary Budget Officer will be a credible non-partisan choice in the future as well. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in response to this nonsense, I want to quote a document from 2006. EOS BOS “Governments cannot be held to account if Parliament does not know the accurate state of public finances.”Who said that? EOS BOS The Conservatives did in their election platform. EOS BOS Was that just meaningless rhetoric? EOS BOS Instead of strengthening the Parliamentary Budget Officer's powers, they have attacked him and undermined him at every opportunity. EOS BOS Instead of being transparent, they forced him to go to court to obtain documents. EOS BOS Why have they abandoned their promises of transparency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, we want a non-partisan Parliamentary Budget Officer who provides credible opinions on tax matters. EOS BOS The Library of Parliament is currently searching for a new Parliamentary Budget Officer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us talk about safety. EOS BOS Half of all Quebeckers get their drinking water from the St. Lawrence, and a number of them are calling on the federal government to ensure that it has the capacity to deal with a major oil spill caused by one of the supertankers leaving Sorel-Tracy. EOS BOS What is more, the environment commissioner seriously doubts that Transport Canada and the Coast Guard are equipped to handle such a spill. EOS BOS How could the government authorize such a significant increase in tanker traffic on the St. Lawrence, when, by all accounts, it is not prepared to deal with a major oil spill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last year my colleague, then minister of transport, set in place a world-class tanker safety panel, chaired by a very eminent captain and former CEO of Port Metro Vancouver. EOS BOS The panel found that we were prepared to respond to spills in the country, but we could do better. EOS BOS We have taken its recommendations and we have been implementing these recommendations and have been announcing this as we go along. EOS BOS We want to make sure that people are prepared for a spill and that we try to prevent spills as well, and in the case of a spill that has happened, that the taxpayer is protected from having to cover the price of the entire spill.

BOS Mr. Speaker, any squandering of public money is unacceptable. EOS BOS The foolish spending on the G8 quite simply should not have happened. EOS BOS To quote someone who is well known in Canadian politics, “I can only hope that it is the last volume in a...spree of waste and wild spending....” EOS BOS Who said that? EOS BOS It was the former President of the Treasury Board and current Minister of Foreign Affairs. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives start showing some accountability to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my friend from Hull— EOS BOS Aylmer for going back and reading various quotes I made as president of Treasury Board. EOS BOS I do hope other members of her caucus will reflect on some of those great speeches and comments. EOS BOS This is what the government did. EOS BOS We spent money fixing up an airport in North Bay. EOS BOS We spent money fixing up a provincial highway in southern Ontario. EOS BOS We built a community centre. EOS BOS Those are all good public infrastructure projects that will benefit people in these municipalities for many years to come. EOS BOS The Auditor General has come forward with some good advice and some good observations, and the government accepts all that good advice and will do better in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to the 2016 census, the first nations population in Canada has increased by 43% since 2006. EOS BOS That is four times more than the non-indigenous population. EOS BOS Last year, one in five indigenous people lived in crowded homes and homes in need of major repair. EOS BOS That is shameful, and it is a federal responsibility. EOS BOS Will the minister immediately commit to implementing a targeted housing strategy for indigenous people living on and off reserve? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for raising this very important issue. EOS BOS We know that housing is an absolutely essential criteria for people to have to be able to enjoy a good quality of life. EOS BOS That is why in budget 2016 we committed $550 million over two years, which has gone to support indigenous housing, first nations housing on reserve. EOS BOS I am pleased to report to the House that today 8,800 units have already been either built or are in the process of being built and renovated. EOS BOS This is good news. EOS BOS There is much more to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I was recently approached in relation to the inadequate level of mental health support for soldiers at Garrison Petawawa. EOS BOS The Liberals have let the number of mental health providers drop so low that the soldiers at Garrison Petawawa are forced into group sessions instead of one-on-one therapy. EOS BOS What is it going to take for the Prime Minister to restore the levels of mental health support for the soldiers and the people who serve in the Canadian Armed Forces so that they once again have patient-centred treatment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the care and welfare and especially the mental health of our troops are extremely important given what we ask them to do. EOS BOS We are looking at all of the aspects of lessons from the past and what is happening now. EOS BOS As part of the defence policy review that we undertook last year, this is a very big component. EOS BOS I can assure the member that we are moving forward. EOS BOS Resources have been put in place now, and into the future, we will definitely be making sure that all of our troops have the mental health resources for them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the people of Libya are currently under a huge amount of stress. EOS BOS Right now, there are a number of students of Libyan origin studying in Canada. EOS BOS The freeze on trade relations with Libya is putting their scholarships and student visas in jeopardy. EOS BOS Will this government extend the temporary exemption granted to Libyan students living in Canada, and will it ensure that they receive financial assistance immediately? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has acted quickly and decisively to approve an exemption from the sanctions so students would not suffer. EOS BOS It is now time for the Libyan government to release the necessary funds to support the students and their families. EOS BOS We will continue to press Libya to provide the funding as soon as possible. EOS BOS We will continue to work with these students to ensure they can complete their education in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, stories of constituents upset with Canada Post's decision to end door-to-door delivery are pouring in across Canada, not only because of the decision itself but the treatment that people receive from Canada Post. EOS BOS When one of my constituents phoned to express legitimate concern about the location of a community mailbox in her neighbourhood, she felt that her concerns were unfairly dismissed. EOS BOS She told us that she was upset beyond belief. EOS BOS When will the minister start listening to Canadians and stop making excuses for Canada Post? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member knows that in 2014 Canada Post delivered 1.4 billion fewer letters than it did in 2006, and that two-thirds of Canadians currently do not have door-to-door delivery. EOS BOS Canada Post must balance its finances without being a burden on Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS The NDP's so-called plan for Canada Post would cost taxpayers half a billion dollars a year, which means it would have to raise taxes on Canadians. EOS BOS We will not let it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind everyone that Canada Post made nearly $200 million in profits last year alone. EOS BOS Over 3,000 people in my riding have signed a petition opposing the elimination of home mail delivery. EOS BOS The towns of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Huntingdon and Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague have passed a resolution calling for a moratorium on the installation of community mailboxes. EOS BOS Nearly 600 cities and towns have denounced what is happening at Canada Post. EOS BOS Will the government listen to our constituents or will it keep forcing people to use community mailboxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, maybe the member should actually read Canada Post's 2014 annual report. EOS BOS On page 68, it states:Without pension relief, the Corporation would have been required to make special payments of approximately $1.3 billion in 2014. EOS BOS The special payments without pension relief would amount to $1.4 billion in 2015... They should not be spiking the ball. EOS BOS Canadians expect that Canada Post will not be a financial burden to them, and so do do we. EOS BOS That is why we expect it to carry through with its five-point plan. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for over a century Algoma Central Railway has played a significant part in the northern Ontario transportation network, providing passenger train service to numerous people in this area. EOS BOS The ACR runs almost 500 km between Sault Ste. EOS BOS Marie and Hearst. EOS BOS In particular, it has served the canoeists, snowmobilers, cottagers and tourists who wish to travel within this beautiful region. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Transport please update the House on the latest action our government is taking on this important file? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to the House the great work that our colleague, the member for Sault Ste. EOS BOS Marie, has been doing on this file. I also want to thank the Algoma Central Railway passenger service stakeholder working group for its extensive study on this issue. EOS BOS I am very pleased to inform the House that our government will be providing funding over the next three years to maintain the operation of the passenger rail service from Sault Ste. EOS BOS Marie to Hearst, Ontario. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, again Conservatives are making things up and running full speed away from accountability. EOS BOS Yesterday I asked the immigration minister about the disappointing numbers around refugee resettlement. EOS BOS Instead of taking responsibility, he just made excuses. EOS BOS Instead of living up to their commitments to increase refugee settlement, Conservatives settled 25% fewer refugees than the year before. EOS BOS They failed to meet even their own target. EOS BOS When will the minister stop the spin and fix this problem? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member opposite is not aware that our by far largest refugee resettlement program was for Iraqis who were in Syria. EOS BOS There is a civil war in Syria. EOS BOS As a consequence, we had to shut down our embassy and immigration office in Damascus last spring, thereby effectively suspending the resettlement of our largest refugee program. EOS BOS We are trying very hard to get that back on track by processing out of Amman, Beirut and Ankara. EOS BOS However, even our government is unable to overcome the problem of the civil war in Syria when it interrupts the processing of those applications. EOS BOS That said, we continue to resettle one out of every 10 resettled refugees worldwide and lead the world in per capita terms. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they failed to make their own settlement targets, but all we get are more excuses and much more spin. EOS BOS For some reason, the minister still refuses to meet with leading Syrian-Canadian organizations. EOS BOS He will not meet with the Syrian National Council, the Syrian Canadian Council, the Syrian Expatriates Organization, Canadian Relief for Syria, the Syrian Student Association or Watan. EOS BOS The Syrian refugee crisis is worsening. EOS BOS Why will the minister not meet with these groups? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone can criticize me for having met with an inadequate number of Canadian cultural communities and organizations. EOS BOS It is true that I have not met with every single one, but I can say that I have met with many groups of Syrian Canadians and dozens of Syrian Canadians on this issue in the recent past. EOS BOS This week, I was the first minister in 37 years to go to Iraq, in part to meet with Syrians dealing with the refugee crisis and to work with them, our embassy and our local officials on how we can help in that local situation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member that what was said yesterday in the House was not very bright. EOS BOS So we will give the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage another chance to find something intelligent to say, because yesterday he was way off base. EOS BOS The Conservatives can claim that they invest in culture, but when we look at their actions, we see that, really, they are destroying this sector. EOS BOS The Conservatives are axing thriving institutions, although they claim to support artists. EOS BOS They are ruthlessly closing the CineRobotheque in Montreal and Mediatheque in Toronto. EOS BOS Can the government explain how these closures are supposed to help culture? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is very proud of the investments it has made in the cultural sector, particularly in the NFB. EOS BOS That institution has begun digitizing its collection of 13,000 titles, which is good news for Canadians. EOS BOS There are already 2,000 titles available online. EOS BOS [English]Not everybody lives in Montreal and Toronto. EOS BOS People live all across the country and they want access to the dramatic and great collection of the National Film Board. EOS BOS By putting it online, we are ensuring that Canadians from coast to coast to coast have access to those collections. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is funny, but telling me that things are being digitized does not necessarily reassure me in any way regarding what is happening at Library and Archives Canada. EOS BOS It really seems as though the Conservatives believe that Canadians can be easily manipulated. EOS BOS As for Canadian cinema, we have been very successful in recent years, with several awards and nominations. EOS BOS This year, the Philippe Falardeau film Monsieur Lazhar was nominated for an Oscar. EOS BOS Yesterday, Philippe Falardeau himself spoke out against the fact that the government is “getting rid of things without any idea of how to replace them”. EOS BOS Someone mentioned consultation earlier. EOS BOS This is the same thing. EOS BOS Is this how the government wants to reward such tremendous international success, by making these draconian cuts to the NFB? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can understand that it is not a good time to be an opposition critic for culture and heritage. EOS BOS We have invested more than any government in history has in arts and culture. EOS BOS Our Minister of Finance has helped create 750,000 net new jobs, taxes are down, interest rates are down and our artists and musicians are at the top of the billboard charts. EOS BOS Our film directors are winning awards across the world. EOS BOS Our television productions are being picked up. not only by big American broadcasters but by broadcasters around the world. EOS BOS We just learned that our AM and FM radio stations have returned to pre-2008 recession levels of profitability and are creating jobs and economic opportunity. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives really have no respect for the work federal public servants do. EOS BOS It is unbelievable that they recently sent a mass email asking public servants to retweet Conservative propaganda and their latest election slogan. EOS BOS Is that not partisan?Why do the Conservatives not let public servants do their jobs and serve Canadians instead of trying to embroil them in their electioneering? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are proud of our tax cuts for Canadian families. EOS BOS We have reduced their tax burden by $3,500 a year. EOS BOS With the reforms recently announced by the Prime Minister, the average Canadian family will have an additional $1,200 a year and all families with children under 18 years of age will benefit from these tax cuts and receive these new family benefits. EOS BOS We obviously have to inform Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to commemorate Remembrance Day on Saturday, it emerged this morning that the Liberal government plans to cut allowances to elite soldiers if they are sick or injured for more than 180 days. EOS BOS I will say it again for the benefit of the House, more than 180 days. EOS BOS Once more, the actions of this self-proclaimed fair and equitable government prove it is anything but. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister explain to us why this government sees nothing wrong with cutting financial compensation to our soldiers while shamelessly protecting its rich Liberal friends, like Stephen Bronfman? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the health and well-being of our soldiers is our top priority. EOS BOS The changes we made give soldiers a grace period of almost six months to transition to their regular pay rate. EOS BOS Our government is committed to ensuring that soldiers are compensated fairly for their service to Canada. EOS BOS That is why our government recently approved a 6.34% pay raise for most soldiers. EOS BOS In addition to their pay, some soldiers receive one-time allowances when they are exposed to higher levels of risk or hardship, as is the case for paratroopers and rescue specialists or those who spend long periods of time— EOS
BOS The hon. member for Richmond—Arthabaska. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the decisions we make in life are reflections of our values. EOS BOS The actions of this government are disappointing. EOS BOS It has no respect for the men and women in uniform who risk their lives to defend Canada. EOS BOS Crisis management is a strange way to govern. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister have a sense of the additional pressure that this government is inflicting on our soldiers and their families, these Canadians who make the ultimate sacrifice for their country? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to our veterans. EOS BOS We have shown that since we came into power. EOS BOS We are investing in financial security. EOS BOS We have reopened offices. EOS BOS We have invested in front-line staff. EOS BOS We are delivering on mental health services to better support our troops, and we will continue to find ways to help them build their lives after service. EOS BOS Our government believes in our veterans and will be there with them every step of the way. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that this government swore to make mental illness a priority, and it is now imposing on our soldiers who struggle with traumatic stress a maximum period of 180 days to recover. EOS BOS The Liberals made that decision. EOS BOS The Liberal government seems to have two ways of dealing with people: one for its Liberal cronies and another for all other Canadians, including our soldiers. EOS BOS Should members of the Canadian Armed Forces rush back to work if they are still injured or ill, or even if they are not ready, to avoid being penalized by this Liberal government? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to our Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans and their families. EOS BOS We continue to build upon the supports we have in our mandate letter, including reopening offices, investments in front-line staff, delivering on financial security, improving supports for mental health. EOS BOS I will let the member know that we are investing in a centre of excellence for mental health for our veterans and their families to get the help that they need. EOS BOS We are standing by our veterans and their families, unlike the Conservatives, who ignored them in the 10 years that they were in office. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last night, we were shocked to learn that the current Liberal government is stripping the pay of our brave men and women who are severely injured in the line of duty. EOS BOS This disgraceful decision to remove benefits from those who put their lives on the line for us is nothing short of cold and heartless. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister do the right thing and reverse this shameful pay cut to our Canadian special forces? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the health and well-being of our soldiers are top priorities. EOS BOS The changes that we made give soldiers a grace period of nearly six months to transition to their regular rate of pay. EOS BOS What is more, our ill and injured veterans have access to a significant level of support to help them to recover. EOS BOS The chief of the defence staff is responsible for administering these polices, and the Minister of National Defence asked him to review this file to make sure it is appropriate. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister seems to have no problem making sure his friends are all taken care of, whether it is proclaiming Stephen Bronfman innocent or turning a blind eye to the Minister of Finance's blatant conflict of interest, but when it comes to doing what is right for our men and women in uniform and those who put their lives on the line every day, the Prime Minister has no time and zero sympathy. EOS BOS We can tell that from the minister's answer. EOS BOS Do the Liberals understand the damage that they are inflicting on our Canadian military by cutting the monthly allowances of these soldiers? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that our soldiers receive fair compensation for the service they render to our country. EOS BOS That is why our government recently approved a pay increase of 6.34% for most military personnel. EOS BOS In addition to their regular pay, some soldiers also receive allowances when they are called upon to carry out special duties or more difficult tasks or when they are exposed to a higher level of risk. EOS BOS These include paratroopers, rescue specialists, and those who are deployed for a long time, either on land or sea. EOS BOS Most of these allowances were also increased by 5.1%. EOS BOS Our soldiers are well-paid— EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I got carried away because of my passion and frustration, and I used some unparliamentary language. EOS BOS I apologize and would like to officially withdraw my remarks. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning around 10:30, I happened to be in the foyer of the Centre Block and I saw a wonderful ceremony whereby three ministers of the government, surrounded by about 20 Conservative colleagues, were honouring our armed forces on behalf of Parliament and transferring a flag to, I believe, a chief warrant officer. EOS BOS There were a couple of other members of the armed forces as well. EOS BOS I am also a very proud member of the armed forces. EOS BOS The Liberal Party also believes in honouring our men and women. EOS BOS I would like to know why we were not notified and invited to this ceremony. EOS </s> BOS Unfortunately, question period is over. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member had a chance to ask that question during question period. EOS BOS It is not a point of order. EOS BOS Perhaps it is a matter he can ask the minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, thanks to Quebec's health minister, we now know that, when it comes time for the Liberals to fund health care, the question is, “ EOS BOS What is in it for me politically?”Is that what it comes down to for the Minister of Health? EOS BOS She should not be playing politics with the health of Quebeckers and Canadians. EOS BOS Can the minister stand here today and tell us that the government is prepared to invest in mental health as the provinces requested and the Liberals promised? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when I spoke to my counterparts, the ministers of health in the provinces and territories, I made it very clear to them that this is not a political discussion. EOS BOS This is about doing the right thing for Canadians. EOS BOS This is about good public policy. EOS BOS I am very committed to the matter of mental health care. EOS BOS I have a mandate to make sure that Canadians have better mental health care, but I also have a responsibility to make sure that when we invest in mental health care, when we invest home care, when we invest in palliative care, that Canadians will see that they actually get better access to care. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals may be walking away from a new commitment to mental health funding. EOS BOS Quebec's health minister said that he was worried that funding for mental illness is not a priority for this finance minister or this Prime Minister because “they don't see a political gain on that.”While it may not pay off like cash-for-access fundraisers, I can assure the House that for Canadians suffering from mental illness, there is much to gain. EOS BOS Will the Liberals commit to real negotiations with the provinces based on that rather than based on political calculations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the matter of mental illness in this country, I will never play politics. EOS BOS I know that mental illness affects every Canadian. EOS BOS Every one of us in this chamber is affected by mental illness. EOS BOS This is a very serious matter. EOS BOS When I met with my counterparts, they wanted to talk about money. EOS BOS I wanted to talk about health. EOS BOS I wanted to talk about how we can actually help Canadians to have better mental health care. EOS BOS I am determined to do that. EOS BOS I really look forward to working with my counterparts to make that happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once, twice, three times, four times. EOS BOS It seems that the Prime Minister cannot count. EOS BOS The Liberal government announced the creation of a private infrastructure bank sponsored by BlackRock. EOS BOS I have three questions. EOS BOS Why are positions on the board of directors already being advertised when the bill has not been passed? EOS BOS Why is there no one from the public sector on the board of directors when we have contributed $35 billion of our money? EOS BOS Given that the bank is supposed to meet the needs of municipalities, why will private companies be able to access money for their own projects, based on their own needs? EOS BOS I want an answer. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to point out once more that Canadians expect this government to build infrastructure that will contribute to their day-to-day lives and economic productivity, and improve their quality of life when they return home from work. EOS BOS We are going to invest $180 billion in infrastructure in the coming years, but we know that the needs are even greater. EOS BOS Therefore, we have to be able to work with municipalities, provinces, unions, and many investors in order to build the infrastructure we need. EOS BOS That is part of our vision for the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite the Conservatives' lovely promises, true pay equity is still a long way off. EOS BOS Women's economic standing will not improve under a Conservative government. EOS BOS The minister responsible for butchering employment insurance is even looking for new ways to further restrict women's access to benefits. EOS BOS Believe it or not, pregnancy is now considered to be refusal of employment. EOS BOS Just as many women work part-time as men. EOS BOS That means the minister is targeting them with her quotas. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives stop punishing women just because they are women? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the accusations made by the member are completely ludicrous. EOS BOS The reality is that our government is focused on jobs, on economic growth and on long-term prosperity, which I believe is incredibly important to me as a woman. EOS BOS We have created 950,000 net new jobs. EOS BOS Our unemployment is 7%. EOS BOS These are all positive factors that help us all, including my gender. EOS BOS However, more specifically, I am very proud of the work we have been doing with employment insurance to ensure that the product is there for people when they need it most, when they lose their jobs through circumstances no fault of their own. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, changes to pilotage requirements on the Great Lakes are overdue. EOS BOS Thunder Bay welcomes salties that come thousands of kilometres from around the world, waiting and waiting for a local pilot to go that last kilometre to our grain terminals. EOS BOS Let us facilitate trade not impede it. EOS BOS My constituents are asking, “ EOS BOS Can we get some common sense about pilotage requirements in Thunder Bay and throughout the Great Lakes?” EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, marine pilots are a very important part of our supply chain. EOS BOS They are uniquely qualified to be able to take vessels in Canada through those areas of specific water conditions and ensure they can avoid hazards. EOS BOS As a result, they play an important part. EOS BOS The Canadian Transportation Act is currently being reviewed by a pre-eminent panel, chaired by David Emerson. EOS BOS It will be looking at the future of transportation in Canada, and I am sure this issue will come to its attention. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the only shrinkage Canadians will see will be from the Conservative government's cuts to services and infrastructure spending that our economy actually needs. EOS BOS Conservative mismanagement has put the joint support ship program into disarray. EOS BOS The New Democrats and Canadians support this program because it is good for our navy, good for our economy and creates real jobs. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives continuing to ignore the advice and evidence of the Parliamentary Budget Officer? EOS BOS When will they stop shooting the messenger long enough to actually listen to the message? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP leader has been getting a message and I hear he will be in Sherbrooke today, which is quite timely because he will be with his NDP candidate there, his own hand-picked candidate since he chose them all, and that is the candidate who is now an MP who said, “ EOS BOS In my campaign, I said sovereignty will be done in Quebec”. EOS BOS He went on to say, “we will respect sovereignty in the NDP”.I guess the reason the NDP leader is in Sherbrooke today is to try to prevent a repeat of what we saw yesterday. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, now we have the unelected, unaccountable and under investigation Senate now doing the Conservative government's dirty work going after the Parliamentary Budget Officer. EOS BOS Senator Anne Cools said this: “...the mistaken and false notion that Kevin Page is a watchdog of Parliament, with a mandate to oversee...the government’s activities in the realm of the public finance. EOS BOS He is not”. EOS BOS This is pretty rich coming from a Senate that does not have the ethical capacity to look after its own public finances. EOS BOS When will the government call off its Senate attack dogs and let Kevin Page do his work for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know the member is critical of independence, but it seems not everybody who belonged to the NDP caucus is so critical of independence, at least for Quebec. EOS BOS In fact, yesterday the Bloc Québécois leader was asked if there were more NDP MPs who might follow the path of the one that went yesterday to show his true colours and join the Bloc Québécois. EOS BOS What did he say? EOS BOS He said, “we know that they have sovereignists in the NDP”. EOS BOS Stay tuned. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the RCMP recently arrested 10 people who were radicalized in Montreal and who were planning to travel abroad to join the international jihadist movement. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness please tell Canadians what our government is doing to counter this threat? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, here is what Louise Vincent, the sister of slain Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, said, “ EOS BOS If C-51 had been in place on October 19... EOS BOS Martin Couture-Rouleau would...have been in prison and my brother would not be dead today”. EOS BOS That is why we put this bill together, despite the opposition, comments and attitude of the NDP. EOS BOS The RCMP said “ EOS BOS we welcome” the lowering of thresholds in Bill C-51. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because police will be able to put terrorists behind bars and keep Canadians safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, section 12 of the Conflict of Interest Act states that no minister shall accept travel on private aircraft except in exceptional circumstances. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's trip was not a last-minute travel deal on Expedia.ca. EOS BOS There is plenty of planning involved when any minister travels. EOS BOS A significant number of people in the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office would have been briefed on the travel plans. EOS BOS Was the Prime Minister ever advised by anyone in the PMO or PCO that travelling by private helicopter would break section 12 of the act? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as has been previously stated, the Prime Minister was on a personal family vacation with a long-standing friend, who he has known for a long time. EOS BOS As has also been stated time and time again, the Prime Minister will answer any questions that the commissioner will have. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister truly believed that his new year's getaway did not present ethical problems, he would not have tried so hard to hide it. EOS BOS No one believes the Prime Minister was not advised his actions would lead to a clear breach of the ethics law. EOS BOS The act is clear, as clear as the Prime Minister's decision was to ignore it. EOS BOS Is it not true that the Prime Minister kept this a secret because he knew the Ethics Commissioner would have told him it violated the act? EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister think he is above the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member should be reminded that the Prime Minister was on a family vacation with a long-standing friend, who he has known for a long time. EOS BOS As the member should also know, and as has been stated time and time again, the Prime Minister will answer any questions that the commissioner will have. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians have never been so badly served as they are by this Prime Minister, who thinks he is totally above the law. EOS BOS He is undermining Canadians' confidence in our democracy, and we are all outraged by the investigations into ethical issues, because the common thread in them all is that the Liberal Party of Canada put its own interests first. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister finally admit his lapse in judgment in using the Aga Khan's helicopter, and get to work for the benefit of all Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is working for all Canadians, and as we have already indicated, the Prime Minister was on a family vacation with a long-time friend. EOS BOS As we have also said repeatedly, the Prime Minister will answer any questions the commissioner might have. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since the start of the new year, whenever the Prime Minister has talked about his Christmas vacation, he says whatever he can to try to justify his lapse in judgment. EOS BOS However, despite his verbal somersaults, he knows very well that he violated section 12 of the Conflict of Interest Act by travelling on a private helicopter during his Christmas vacation. EOS BOS Where I come from, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like duck, it must be a duck. EOS BOS Instead of hiding behind the Ethics Commissioner, will the Prime Minister finally admit that he broke the law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said repeatedly, the Prime Minister will answer any questions the commissioner might have. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives lack vision and are not fit to build the economy of tomorrow. EOS BOS According to Analytica Advisors, the Canadian clean technology industry is losing market share, dropping from 14th to 19th place in the world. EOS BOS That is because of the government's lack of political will and lack of investment in innovative technologies. EOS BOS Why is the government asleep at the switch when it comes to supporting the green technology sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are investing in green infrastructure, energy efficiency, renewable and clean energy technologies that produce less emitting energy and fuels. EOS BOS We are proud that Canada has one of the cleanest electricity systems in the world, with 79% coming from non-emitting sources. EOS BOS While that member voted against increasing investments in clean technology, we remain committed to supporting its development. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we want clean energy, not hot air. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Minister of the Environment's department admitted that it could not do the math on climate change. EOS BOS It looks like the government cannot do the math either when it comes to clean-tech exports and jobs. EOS BOS Global investment in clean tech last year topped $300 billion, but according to a new report, Canada's share of that global clean-tech market dropped by 41%. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because the Conservatives are doing nothing for our clean-tech sector and exports. EOS BOS Where is the plan to support Canada's clean tech and boost our exports? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike that member who wants to impose a carbon tax, our government's sector-by-sector approach is demonstrating results, while keeping taxes low. EOS BOS Our government has made significant investments to promote clean energy projects that protect the environment, create jobs and grow the economy. EOS BOS We are proud that Canada relies on non-emitting sources for 79% of our electricity mix, one of the cleanest in the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has stated in this House that when it comes to trade deals, “we need more transparency on what is happening. EOS BOS We need not just great photo ops, but the details of what is going on”. EOS BOS Therefore, it seems a little strange then that only Chinese state-run media is reporting that Canadian officials have been in Beijing since last Monday for secret meetings on a bilateral trade agreement. EOS BOS Will the minister be open and transparent with Canadians and tell us if she is negotiating a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we owe it to Canadian workers and their families to ensure that we have the access we need to the significant Asia-Pacific market. EOS BOS We will continue to explore ways to expand our commercial relations and our progressive trade agenda throughout the region in the most effective way possible. EOS BOS This will be the message of the Minister of International Trade at the upcoming high-level dialogue in China. EOS BOS As well, and as the member opposite well knows, all of us in this House look forward to sharing the committee's recommendations on the future of our trade with the Asia region. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the committee has not done any work on China, and it is all about consultations until it should. EOS BOS The Liberals have turned the softwood lumber deal into a crisis. EOS BOS The Liberals are failing Canadian farmers on pulse exports to India; that deal is up in March. EOS BOS The Liberals rolled over on negotiations on NAFTA without really knowing what they are putting at risk. EOS BOS Now, the Liberals are engaged in secret negotiations with Chinese officials. EOS BOS It is more of the same. EOS BOS Why do the Liberals not start cleaning up the messes they have already created before they launch new negotiations with China? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite well knows, Canada is a trading nation. EOS BOS We understand the importance of strengthening Canada's role in the global economy and we are very concerned about the rising ways of protectionism we see around the world. EOS BOS To turn to Japan, for instance, it is a long-standing and important partner for us, and that has not changed. EOS BOS The international trade report on TPP will help guide us as we expand commercial relations and our progressive trade agenda in the Asia region. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the First Nations Information Governance Centre has issued a report that paints a bleak picture of living conditions for first nations people. EOS BOS Almost one out of four first nations adults lives in overcrowded houses, half live in homes with mildew, and one out of five reduces the size of his or her meals simply because there is not enough food. EOS BOS [Translation]The worst thing is that these problems have gotten worse since the Conservatives came to power. EOS BOS [English]Will the government finally admit there is a problem and actually do something about first nations living conditions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we continue to work to improve the quality of life and the economic prosperity of aboriginal peoples. EOS BOS We had a meeting with the first nations chiefs at the historic Crown-First Nations Gathering to discuss shared priorities and explore new ways of working together. EOS BOS We are building the foundations for economic and social success. EOS BOS Concrete actions are being taken on education, economic development, housing, child and family services, access to safe drinking water, and matrimonial real property. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that the Minister of Transport himself thinks that selling off our airports is good for travellers. EOS BOS If he has listened to any of the advice he has been receiving over the past year, he will have heard that this is a bad idea. EOS BOS However, as he has stated, the Minister of Finance will make that decision, and we now know he needs the billions of dollars that the sale of the airports to international investors will provide to hide the failure of Liberal budgeting. EOS BOS Just how desperate is the minister to hide his mess? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government recognizes that a strong, integrated, and modern transportation system is fundamental to Canada's continuing economic performance and competitiveness. EOS BOS We will also support greater choice, better service, lower costs, and new rights for middle-class Canadian travellers. EOS BOS We are working hard to improve the transportation system to better serve Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that answer has absolutely nothing to do with the question. EOS BOS Canadians are worried. EOS BOS The Liberal government is out of cash. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport refuses to say whether the government is going to sell some airports to pay the interest on the Minister of Finance's credit card. EOS BOS Will the minister finally give us a straight answer? EOS BOS Is the government going to sell the Quebec City, Montreal, and Vancouver airports, yes or no, and more importantly, tell us who the buyers will be? EOS BOS Canadians have the right to know. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, any decision about Canada's transportation system will be in the best interests of Canadian travellers and Canadian gateways. EOS BOS We will make strategic investments in trade and transportation projects that build stronger, more efficient transportation corridors to international markets and help Canadian businesses to compete, grow, and create more jobs for the middle class. EOS BOS That is the program we are on, and we are going to continue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are being punished with cuts to core services to pay for Conservative financial incompetence. EOS BOS That is being seen as Canada's national debt rises to over $600 billion. EOS BOS Closures of immigration offices across Canada and in Buffalo have left people asking questions they cannot get answered. EOS BOS The CIC website barely provides updates on increases in processing times but is a virtual black hole when it comes to updates on personal files. EOS BOS When will the minister reinstate these services and make the necessary changes, instead of leaving people in the dark? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member has it absolutely wrong. EOS BOS Our new central processing office in Ottawa is processing applications more quickly than they were in Buffalo. EOS BOS This is astonishing, coming from the Liberals. EOS BOS The Liberal immigration legacy left us with wait times of eight and nine years across the entire range of programs. EOS BOS There was a million people waiting in the backlog. EOS BOS Thanks to strong action taken by the government, opposed consistently by the Liberals, we are now getting to a just-in-time system that is going from seven and eight year wait times to one year processing times for applicants for immigration. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals dipped into the employment insurance fund. EOS BOS Now the Conservatives are trying to kill the program all together. EOS BOS That hurts Canadian families. EOS BOS The Conservatives would have us believe that the electoral fraud happened only in the riding of Guelph, when in fact, no less than 55 other ridings are currently under investigation: 20 in British Columbia, 14 in the Prairies and 20 in Quebec, and that number continues to rise. EOS BOS The Conservatives voted in favour of our motion to give the commissioner more powers and they promised to make changes, but nothing has been done since. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives take electoral fraud seriously? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a comprehensive proposal from the government will be forthcoming shortly. EOS BOS The fact is that the Federal Accountability Act passed through the House in 2006. EOS BOS In that act we eliminated any donations by corporations and unions, and yet knowing that the NDP still accepted thousands of dollars in illegal donations from unions. EOS BOS The real question is, can it follow the law? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but we are talking about an investigation into voter fraud. EOS BOS I do not know if the member understands that. EOS BOS Maybe he does not understand that 56 ridings are now being investigated. EOS BOS The Conservatives' claims that they are co-operating do not add up because we have found out that Conservative Party lawyers delayed responding to Elections Canada for 90 days. EOS BOS That is not co-operation; it is called stalling for time. EOS BOS Since the numbers have been traced back to the Conservative Party's headquarters, when is the government going to get serious about holding itself to account? EOS BOS Whom are the Conservatives covering up for? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have said all along that we are working proactively with Elections Canada to find out exactly what went on in the riding of Guelph. EOS BOS That is in stark contrast to the approach of the NDP when it accepted $340,000 in illegal union money. EOS BOS That party did not co-operate with Elections Canada or anyone else. EOS BOS That party tried to cover it up so that Canadians would not find out. EOS BOS Canadians did find out and the NDP will be held accountable by the Canadian people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member needs to update his Rolodex of sleazy excuses. EOS BOS The Conservatives claim that the issue in Guelph involved one kid. EOS BOS We are talking about 56 ridings and the fact that they refuse to answer to Elections Canada. EOS BOS Speaking of that, the Labrador minister has refused to come clean about his breaking of election laws. EOS BOS He has refused to explain why he hid free flights and refused to explain why he and his campaign manager were promoted by the Prime Minister after they broke the rules. EOS BOS Since it has worked out so well for him, I would like to ask the member for Labrador, does he take the issue of election crime seriously, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course he does. EOS BOS I think all Canadians take it seriously when they learn that a political party has taken $340,000 in illegal union money. EOS BOS On this side of the House we have a member of Parliament for Labrador who is working hard to defend the interests of the people he represents and working to create jobs in his community. EOS BOS What does the opposition do? EOS BOS It attacks him for spending too much time in his community and making too much of an effort creating jobs for his constituents. EOS BOS Those are the kind of attacks that we can live with. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since this government was first elected, we passed more than 30 measures to improve the confidence of Canadians in our justice system. EOS BOS In order for Canadians to have confidence in the justice system, they must know that police officers are who they say they are. EOS BOS Personating a peace officer is a serious offence, which must be condemned by this House and all members. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Justice please inform this House about the government's position regarding my private member's bill, Bill C-444, on personating a police officer or public officers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think I can, but first I want to thank the hon. member for Red Deer for introducing this important legislation. EOS BOS The bill addresses a crime that has serious negative consequences for the public. EOS BOS There have been a number of incidents over the years where Canadians were victimized because offenders were personating a police officer. EOS BOS The bill sends a message that criminals should not be allowed to exploit the public's trust. EOS BOS I am pleased to inform the House that the government is in fact going to completely support this. EOS BOS For once, I would like the opposition to do the same. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Toronto Mayor-elect John Tory is committed to working with all levels of government to invest in the infrastructure on public transit, essential to making our community competitive. EOS BOS The Ontario finance minister is already committed to working collaboratively with him to make these critical investments. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance stand up for his city and reverse his decision to slash infrastructure spending by almost 90% this year and increase the funding necessary to improve the quality of life for Torontonians, which will create jobs now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first I have to congratulate the people who have been elected yesterday in the municipal elections. EOS BOS We are happy to work with them and we will continue to work with them. EOS BOS We have tripled federal infrastructure investments since we took office. EOS BOS For the next 10 years, that is $53 billion that municipalities can count on. EOS BOS In respect of jurisdiction, we will not manage everything in Ottawa. EOS BOS We will work with provinces and municipalities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government just does not get it. EOS BOS Its Building Canada fund commits only $210 million for each of the next two years. EOS BOS In yesterday's municipal elections, voters sent a clear message that the current plans for infrastructure, and in particular public transit, are not good enough. EOS BOS In the GTA and indeed across much of Ontario, we saw a wave of candidates who are focused on city-building and building access to public transit. EOS BOS Will the government heed the calls of Ontario's municipalities and commit to invest more in infrastructure? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am a former mayor. I do not need a lecture from the member about how things work in a city. EOS BOS I know that before our government there was very little money available for cities and for infrastructure in this country. EOS BOS Since we came to power, we have significantly increased support for our municipalities, and we will continue to do so. EOS BOS Announcements are happening all across the country. EOS BOS I am proud of our government and of our Prime Minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, even the Parliamentary Budget Officer suggested last week that the government could make significant investments in the budget and still maintain the Conservatives' goal of a 25% debt to GDP ratio. EOS BOS This would kick-start much-needed investments in public infrastructure across the country. EOS BOS Will the government heed the advice of the Parliamentary Budget Officer and commit the much needed investments in public infrastructure? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the member of the opposition understands the strong fiscal situation of our country. EOS BOS Federal debt to GDP is one-third. EOS BOS It will go down to one-quarter by 2021, and it could decrease even more. EOS BOS We have a strong fiscal situation, and that is why we have introduced the longest and largest infrastructure program in Canadian history, some $70 billion, of which $53 billion will go to the provinces and municipalities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week we heard that the current Minister of Public Works passed over 160 proposals to fund one from a Conservative insider. EOS BOS What kind of message is the minister sending about the government? EOS BOS When a community organization applies for a grant to the Government of Canada, it should not feel the need to do favours for the Conservative Party. EOS BOS It should be able to trust that the proposal will be considered fairly, based on its merits. EOS BOS Why did she pick this project in Markham ahead of all the others? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I always believed that this particular project to improve accessibility for handicapped people at the Markham centre was worthy and was in the public interest. EOS BOS I accept the guidance provided by the commissioner to make sure that these programs are handled in a manner that is fair, accessible, and equitable for everyone involved. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, ever since the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner released her damning report concerning the favouritism shown by the Minister of Public Works, we have been trying to get an explanation. EOS BOS The government claims that the minister acted on her own and in good faith, and yet three ministers and two of the Prime Minister's close advisers intervened on behalf of a good friend of the Prime Minister to overturn a decision made by departmental officials. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us if it is common for three ministers and two of the Prime Minister's advisers to get involved in awarding such a small grant? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I always believed that this project to improve accessibility for handicapped people in the Markham Centre was worthy and in the public interest. EOS BOS I accept the guidance provided by the commissioner to make sure that these grant programs are handled in a manner that is fair, accessible and effective for everyone involved. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as of a few months ago, Agop Evereklian is once again working for the Conservatives. EOS BOS To refresh the memory of the House, this former chief of staff to Mayor Tremblay was found guilty of fraud in 2005. EOS BOS His judgment is so poor that the Prime Minister himself had to ask him to cut ties with a dubious campaign manager during the 2011 campaign. EOS BOS How can the Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec allow someone with such a dubious past in terms of ethics to be involved in distributing grants for the agency? EOS BOS Come on. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec works with all regions of Quebec to promote economic development. EOS BOS I hope my colleague realizes that we have even helped his riding. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to former Conservative Senator Patrick Brazeau, the Minister of Public Works blocked a grant promised by Lawrence Cannon in order to punish the Pontiac voters for voting the wrong way. EOS BOS At the end of the day, it is the people who use the Jean Bosco centre, people with disabilities trying to enter the labour market, who are the victims of the Conservatives' pettiness in this case. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister explain what role his chief of staff played in all of this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, under our Conservative government, Patrick Brazeau is not in charge of grants. EOS BOS The NDP might want Patrick Brazeau to tell them what to do with taxpayers' money, but it does not work that way on this side of the House. EOS BOS It is not surprising that the NDP and the Liberals would have to raise taxes, if they say yes every time Patrick Brazeau or someone else asks for money. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Senator Brazeau was credible enough for the Conservatives to appoint him to the Senate. EOS BOS The director general of the Jean Bosco centre is disgusted with the pettiness of the Conservatives, who are using public funds to reward their friends and punish their adversaries, and I quote: It is disgusting.... EOS BOS Our clientele is disabled and already heavily burdened. EOS BOS People should not have to pay the consequences of such a scheme... EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister explain why his chief of staff, Nigel Wright, got involved in this case? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the application was rejected after both an internal and an external review. EOS BOS We have to decide between projects all the time. EOS BOS What the New Democrats have just confirmed is that they believe that Patrick Brazeau should be in charge of grants and contributions. EOS BOS Maybe that is how they would run their government if they ever had the terrifying prospect of coming anywhere near taxpayers' money, but Canadians will never allow the NDP or the Liberals to do that, because they know that they will only pay more taxes and face more debt if that were to ever happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Vic Toews wife now denies that she took a $1-million kickback from a first nations chief who was directly involved with her husband, the senior minister for Manitoba. EOS BOS She says it was no more than $50,000 tops, as if that makes it okay. EOS BOS I know it is peanuts on the scale of Conservative shenanigans. EOS BOS Mulroney's personal rogues would not even get out of bed for that kind of chump change. EOS BOS Would the government not agree that it is time to tighten up on the post-employment rules for ministers and their spouses so that they cannot exploit the time they spent in public office for personal and private gain? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a dispute between three individuals, none of which is the federal government. EOS BOS At the same time, when it comes to accountability, it is the NDP that owes Canadian taxpayers close to $5 million for illegal offices. EOS BOS That is $2.7 million for illegal offices and millions of dollars for illegal mailings, and they refuse to pay that money back. EOS BOS When it comes to accountability, they have nothing to talk about. EOS BOS They took illegal money from unions. EOS BOS They have illegally taken money from Canadian taxpayers, and now they are refusing to even pay it back. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since 2011, 70% of funding under the enabling accessibility fund has been spent in Conservative ridings. EOS BOS Conservatives have been using a program designed to help those with disabilities as a political slush fund to reward their friends. EOS BOS If that is not bad enough, now the Prime Minister himself ensured that a failed application was put on top of the pile, fast-tracked, and given over $1 million. EOS BOS It is like Duffy all over again. EOS BOS There is one word for this bad behaviour; it is called corruption. EOS BOS How can he defend it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reason we created the enabling accessibility fund is to help people with disabilities have the same access to community centres, churches, synagogues, mosques, and recreational centres every other Canadian enjoys, and that is why we have been proud to fund wheelchair ramps, special elevators, and a whole host of other projects that help disabled people across the country. EOS BOS We have also brought in the registered disability savings fund so that parents can set aside money for their disabled children's futures, and I am happy to say that both of those programs have been an enormous success. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week we heard the racist views of the member for New Brunswick Southwest  on the economic role of “whities” and “brown people”. EOS BOS The member spewing this racism is the Prime Minister's former director of communications. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister do the right thing and kick him out of the Conservative caucus, or is there a place for racism within the government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member has apologized, but who has not apologized is the Liberal leader for his comments earlier this week. EOS BOS In fact, regarding his speech, B'nai Brith has said, “Such language is divisive and only does a disservice to Canadians interested in dealing with pressing issues of the day”. EOS BOS When will the leader of the Liberal Party stand up and apologize for his comments earlier this week? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, so the standard of accountability within the government can be reduced to 140 characters on social media. EOS BOS The member for New Brunswick Southwest has shared his racist views on suitable jobs for “whities” and “brown people”. EOS BOS This is not an isolated incident. EOS BOS The same member has also referred to first nations as Canada's teepee republic. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister remove the member from his caucus, or do Conservatives condone racism? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member has apologized, but we are still waiting for the apology from the Liberal leader for his comments earlier this week EOS BOS .B'nai Brith Canada also said, regarding the Liberal leader, that he:is the latest in a long [line] of politicians who fall into the trap of drawing highly-inappropriate[ly] and offensive Nazi-era comparisons by using the term ‘ EOS BOS none is too many’ haphazardly. EOS BOS The Liberal leader should apologize for his speech given earlier this week. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I encourage the minister to go look at the rates in my region, which went up. EOS BOS According to a report just days before— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Gatineau has the floor. EOS
BOS Oh, Mr. Speaker, we will get to that conversation later. EOS BOS According to a report just days before the $1.8 billion McGill contract was awarded, Arthur Porter was already involving SNC-Lavalin in discussions about future McGill projects in Kuwait. EOS BOS It is clear Conservatives made a mistake in trusting Mr. Porter and promoting to a national security role. EOS BOS It is the government's responsibility to make sure its appointments do not put our national security at risk. EOS BOS When will the government admit Mr. Porter's appointment was its own mistake, and when will it remove him from Privy Council? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, security clearances have not been relaxed under our Conservative government. EOS BOS In fact, we have introduced more rigorous checks for these types of appointments. EOS BOS Arthur Porter submitted his resignation some time ago. EOS BOS The responsibilities that he held have nothing to do with the allegations he is facing now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I will take this as a factual admission, not necessarily a verbal admission. EOS BOS [Translation]The member's defence of this man is rather pathetic. EOS BOS The Conservatives appointed Mr. Porter to head the Security Intelligence Review Committee in 2008, and he resigned in 2011.During that time, he contributed generously to the Conservative Party's election fund and did business with SNC-Lavalin and its former executives, Pierre Duhaime and Riadh Ben Aissa. EOS BOS What do all those people have in common? EOS BOS They have all been charged with fraud, corruption and misappropriation of funds in multiple scandals. EOS BOS Despite all of those revelations, Mr. Porter is still a member of the Privy Council. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Porter has resigned, and the responsibilities that he held have nothing to do with the allegations that he is being charged with. EOS BOS If we are going to talk about individuals who sat on the SIRC committee and who made donations, why do we not talk about donations that were made to the New Democratic Party by the current leader of the Liberal Party who, before he sat on SIRC, made several donations to the NDP? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while greater Victoria is still waiting for Transport Canada's decision on whether to allow a mega yacht marina in the harbour, the developer is already moving ahead. EOS BOS This is despite serious aviation safety issues with float planes landing in what is already a very busy marine channel. EOS BOS Over the past decade there have been numerous near misses between aircraft and marine vessels and this giant private marina for mega yachts would only make things worse. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives, for once, put aside their ties to big business and commit to putting aviation safety and the safety of harbour users ahead of the interests of this developer and the mega yachts of the super rich? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was in B.C. two weeks and met a lot of stakeholders concerned with this issue and many other issues. EOS BOS At Transport Canada, security and safety is very important and we are analyzing it for the moment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last night the government said that it would vote against transparency, citing the administrative burden. EOS BOS The transparency act would actually cut red tape and simplify the process. EOS BOS It would ensure that government information would be available faster, in a less costly way, and in digital, not paper, formats. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister oppose the modernization of our access to information system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it was this government that modernized the system by bringing some 70 agencies and organizations under access to information that were previously not under it, something opposed by the Liberal Party. EOS BOS The Liberal Party not only opposed that Accountability Act, it opposed union transparency and it opposed transparency for people living on first nations reserves. EOS BOS We have nothing to learn on transparency from the Liberals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, funding for east coast businesses from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency declined by a whopping 25% last year alone. EOS BOS Businesses in Atlantic Canada have not suddenly lost their need for support; the Conservatives have lost their willingness to support Atlantic Canada, except, of course, when it comes to the patronage trough. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives leaving the east coast behind? EOS BOS Why is the government not committed to ACOA? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is wrong and fearmongering. EOS BOS If he wants to compare apples to apples and look at investment for economic development, he should take into account stimulus measures that were meant to deal with the recession and the unprecedented level of federal investment in Atlantic Canada, not only by ACOA but Industry Canada and all other departments. EOS BOS Further, he should mention the shipbuilding initiative, which analysts say will create 15,000 jobs and add $2 billion in economic benefits annually. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the priority is the economy. EOS BOS The purpose of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is to promote the economy in the Atlantic region. EOS BOS But rather than help businesses, the Conservatives are using the agency to make partisan appointments. EOS BOS They fired over 100 employees and slashed aid to businesses and organizations by 25%. EOS BOS They are stalling economic development all over the Atlantic region. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives going after communities in the Atlantic region? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the member had done his homework, he would know what is going on in the Atlantic region. EOS BOS He would know that federal investment in Atlantic Canada is higher than ever. EOS BOS He would also know that, according to analysts, the shipbuilding initiative will create 15,000 jobs and inject $2 billion annually into the Canadian economy. EOS BOS He should have read about that in other parts of the newspaper. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, access to cellphone and Internet service is improving, but is still not optimal. EOS BOS In my riding, a number of people who live north of the Saint-Maurice River have no service. EOS BOS How will the government support the 600,000 Canadians living in outlying areas who still do not have cellphone service? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. EOS BOS I would like to remind members that we made a very important announcement for the future of Canada's wireless sector yesterday. EOS BOS There will be a 700 MHz spectrum auction, which will be very effective. EOS BOS Rules about roaming and tower sharing will be tightened. EOS BOS We will also ensure that there is a fourth player in all parts of the country to foster competition and, we hope, to provide better rates for consumers. EOS BOS I would like to remind members that, in 2009, the House adopted the broadband Canada program, which connected more than 220,000 Canadian households to high-speed Internet. EOS BOS My colleague definitely belongs to the wrong party because his party voted against this program, which has been very successful in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Toronto City Council has passed a resolution demanding that Canada Post maintain home delivery. EOS BOS Still, Conservatives are cutting it with no plan. EOS BOS With proposed mega-boxes in neighbourhoods of 10,000 people per square kilometre, whose lawns? EOS BOS What about the traffic, our kids' safety, and seniors?Canada's big city mayors are meeting in Ottawa today. EOS BOS The government should be investing in, not cutting from, our cities. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives ignoring Toronto? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is facing, in the future, an incredible loss in its revenue as a result of the mail not being utilized as much. EOS BOS People are making their choices, but in order to deal with that, it has put out a five-point plan. EOS BOS One of the points in its plan is that door-to-door service be phased out for the remaining one-third of mail boxes or mail deliveries in Canada. EOS BOS That has been in place for two-thirds of Canadian addresses since the 1980s. EOS BOS It has dealt with these matters in the past. EOS BOS I am sure it will continue to deal with these matters in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our cities need federal support to prosper, but the Conservatives do not seem to realize that. EOS BOS While the mayors of Canada's largest cities are meeting today to talk about the pressing issues affecting our communities, the Conservatives' response is to continue to reduce essential services, leaving the people of Rosemère, Lorraine, Bois-des-Filion, Repentigny and Charlemagne without home mail delivery. EOS BOS Why does the government continue to ignore the needs of our municipalities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us get one thing straight. EOS BOS We are not stopping the delivery of mail in general. EOS BOS What is happening is that we are converting, or rather, Canada Post is converting one-third— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Transport still has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is something that they do not want to face, and it is this: already in two-thirds of Canadian households, the mail is not delivered to the door. EOS BOS Over the next five years, Canada Post plans to phase it out in the other one-third of Canadian households. EOS BOS Why is it doing that? EOS BOS It is because of something the NDP does not understand. EOS BOS We are trying to make sure the taxpayer is not burdened in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on another subject, the Conservatives' job credit will cost taxpayers $550 million, but it will create just 800 jobs. EOS BOS The government implemented it without studying the proposal at all. EOS BOS The minister relied exclusively on a Canadian Federation of Independent Business study. EOS BOS The problem is that the study the government based its proposal on had nothing to do with employment; it was about retirement benefits. EOS BOS How can the minister justify throwing away half a billion dollars without having done any analysis at all? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Department of Finance carries out thorough analyses of each measure that we propose, and it analyzed the small business job credit. EOS BOS Small businesses made it very clear that their payroll taxes are the biggest obstacle to employment across Canada. EOS BOS Canadians know that the Liberals and New Democrats would raise taxes for job creators, which would hurt our economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know about the Conservative fondness for offshoring and outsourcing Canadian jobs, but it has gotten so ridiculous that even the Minister of Finance is happy to outsource the analysis of his own schemes to a business lobby group. EOS BOS He did not do his own assessment of his half-billion dollar EI scheme, but relied on one of these lobbyists. EOS BOS It turns out that the study he relied on was totally bogus. EOS BOS That is the problem with outsourcing, namely quality control. EOS BOS Will the minister finally admit that his $550 million EI rip-off is a complete fraud, and that maybe next time he should do his own homework? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I explained before in French, we do an analysis of every single proposal. EOS BOS It was not necessary to do an employment count because there were many other reasons to go ahead with this excellent initiative that will benefit 780,000 small businesses, some 90% of all businesses. EOS BOS Everybody knows that increased taxes are a killer for employment, and we have done the right thing for small business and the Canadian economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the Liberal platform, it was promised that there would be action on the changes Stephen Harper made in the omnibus budget bills, particularly the elimination of the Navigable Waters Protection Act. EOS BOS In fact, it said, “ EOS BOS We will review these changes, restore lost protections, and incorporate more modern safeguards.” EOS BOS Unfortunately, the transport committee came to egregiously weak conclusions, recommending, essentially, keeping in place the Harper regime. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister commit to restoring protections to Canada's navigable waters? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as a government, and personally as a paddler, we are committed to promoting Canada's sustainable economic development while maintaining a safe transportation system and the protection of our lakes and rivers, so absolutely we will consider all input from the independent House of Commons committee on transport, from the public, from indigenous peoples, from provinces and territories, and from a broad range of stakeholders, including industry and marine-protection groups. EOS BOS This is something we feel passionately about and are glad to be moving forward on. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, another day, another vital military procurement project massively mismanageg by the Conservative government. EOS BOS Today the PBO reported that the Conservative budget for the offshore patrol vessels is not realistic because it will only cover four ships, not the six to eight promised by the Conservatives. EOS BOS The people in my riding and across the region are counting on those jobs. EOS BOS Can the minister explain how the government will get the project back on track and get those six to eight vessels it promised built? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact we are confident that we will build six Arctic offshore patrol ships. EOS BOS The contract with Irving, while advanced, is not yet finalized. EOS BOS I should point out that the numbers provided by the PBO are based on erroneous data and rough cost estimates of international vessels with varied capabilities, and they are derived using inaccurate specifications. EOS BOS In one of his assumptions the PBO said it was: ...unable to locate reliable, sufficiently contemporary Canadian data on an acquisition of this nature.... EOS BOS Our national shipbuilding procurement strategy will deliver the goods for our men and women. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the current government stonewalls the PBO every single time, but when it comes down to who is telling the truth, it is the PBO who is always right. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has been announcing these ships since 2007 and promising that the first one would have been built last year. EOS BOS The longer this project is delayed, the more expensive it will get. EOS BOS According to the PBO, if it is delayed another year, they will only be able to build three ships. EOS BOS When is the government going to explain to Canadians that it is not going to keep its promise of building six to eight offshore patrol vessels? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the opposition members voted against having any Arctic offshore patrol ships, so I am not sure what they are so worried about. EOS BOS However, in fact we are confident that we will deliver six Arctic offshore patrol ships, starting construction in 2015. EOS BOS In fact, as part of the national shipbuilding procurement strategy, yesterday for the first time we cut steel at Seaspan for the offshore fisheries science vessel. EOS BOS Our national shipbuilding procurement strategy is moving forward and creating jobs, some estimated 15,000 jobs over the next 30 years, and $2 billion a year in economic benefit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP has been opposed to a toll on the future Champlain Bridge for a long time now. EOS BOS We are talking about a replacement bridge, not a new bridge. EOS BOS The Liberals are not opposed to the toll. EOS BOS The entire region is against the toll, yet the solution the Minister of Infrastructure comes up with is to impose more tolls. EOS BOS Well done. EOS BOS Can the minister at least admit that a toll on the Champlain Bridge would cause traffic problems on the other bridges in Montreal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the good news is that there is going to be a new bridge. EOS BOS A new bridge will be built and the project will create 30,000 jobs in Montreal, Quebec and Canada. EOS BOS That is very good for economic prosperity. EOS BOS In the meantime, we are staying the course and continuing to move forward with the project, including the toll. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today, the Minister of Infrastructure said that he was open to imposing tolls on the federal bridges in Montreal. EOS BOS That would mean tolls on the Champlain Bridge, the Jacques-Cartier Bridge and the Honoré-Mercier Bridge. EOS BOS Once again, the government is making things up as it goes along. EOS BOS Before even thinking about a toll and running the risk of making a complete mess, why does the minister not sit down with provincial and municipal stakeholders in Quebec and develop a coordinated transportation plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is working closely with the Government of Quebec and all the stakeholders from the south shore and Montreal. EOS BOS We are staying the course. EOS BOS A new bridge will be built and 30,000 new jobs will be created. EOS BOS All of this will be done on time, and things are even ahead of schedule. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the recent by-election I knocked on thousands of doors in Calgary Heritage and I heard many concerns from voters about the Liberals. EOS BOS The majority of the people I spoke with were seriously concerned about the Prime Minister's reckless spending with no plans to pay it back. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister acknowledge these concerns and finally explain to Calgarians how he is going to balance the budget and pay down the debt? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member for Calgary Heritage to the House and I wish him all the best in serving his constituents.
              I want to highlight that his predecessor had actually the worst record on growth of any prime minister since R.B. Bennett, and that is what we are working on turning around. EOS BOS We are going to ensure that through delivering more money to the pockets of middle-class families through investing in things like transit, waste water treatment plants, and flood protection for cities like Calgary. EOS BOS We are going to ensure better economic opportunities for citizens and better growth for our entire country. EOS BOS That is our approach. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are failing yet again to show leadership in health care, and Canadians are paying the price. EOS BOS The Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that Canada has the highest percentage of people waiting more than four hours in emergency rooms, and more than half of Canadians say they cannot get appointments with their family doctors when they need them. EOS BOS Why is the Minister of Health cutting billions of dollars from health transfers rather than working with the provinces to reduce wait times, which is a significant issue in this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is absolutely playing a leadership role when it comes to health care. EOS BOS I appreciate the hon. EOS BOS member's question because it gives me an opportunity to talk about all the great investments our government is making. EOS BOS Transfers to the provinces and territories are at record levels and will increase to approximately $40 billion per year by the end of the decade— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Health has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, they are the ones who cut the transfers. EOS BOS We are also funding more than 10,000 health research projects across the country. EOS BOS We have introduced debt forgiveness programs for doctors and nurses who work in rural and remote areas. EOS BOS The opposition talks a good game, but our government is taking concrete actions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a recent poll indicated that Canadians care about Tommy Douglas's legacy and the universal health care system. EOS BOS That is a Canadian value. EOS BOS But leadership is also required to maintain a health care system capable of meeting Canadians' needs. EOS BOS Reducing provincial transfers is not leadership. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives provide the resources the provinces need to do their job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, transfers to the provinces and territories have increased to $40 billion by the end of the decade. EOS BOS It also gives me an opportunity to talk about more investments we are making. EOS BOS We have created the Mental Health Commission of Canada; we have made significant investments in food safety; we funded the creation of medical residents positions; we fund national organizations like the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer. EOS BOS The list goes on. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the environment commissioner just told the government to increase the money that operators set aside to cover the cost of a nuclear or offshore drilling accident. EOS BOS The liability cap is out of date now, far below what other countries require. EOS BOS Previous bills to take taxpayers off the hook for nuclear accidents had overwhelming support but died in 2008 because of an early election call, in 2009 because of prorogation, and in 2010 simply from neglect. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives now raise liability caps? EOS BOS When will we see properly reviewed stand-alone legislation to do it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in Canada the foundation for our liability regime is the polluter pay principle.I should point out as I did the other day that the Commissioner of the Environment said in terms of nuclear liability limits that:—Canada has actually acknowledged that is too low.... EOS BOS My understanding...is they are looking at this now and they may be taking some action in that regard. EOS BOS That action would have been taken years ago if the NDP had not been so determined to filibuster. EOS BOS Those members insisted on putting their own ideology ahead of public safety, as they usually do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans said that the following remarks were taken out of context: “ EOS BOS Grace, you're a great cook. EOS BOS You're going to make a wonderful wife for somebody.”In what context are those remarks acceptable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course we have already dealt with that situation. EOS BOS What we are concentrating on is economic action plan 2013, jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. EOS BOS We are doing all of that without increasing taxes, without reducing transfer payments to the provinces, unlike the NDP, who would raise taxes with a $21 billion carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, perhaps the next time, the minister should stick to his knitting instead of offering unsolicited marriage advice. EOS BOS From childcare to EI— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Kick her out. EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Halifax. EOS </s> BOS I am sorry I did not cite my source. EOS BOS From childcare to EI, the government has gutted services designed to help and protect women. EOS BOS Instead of encouraging young women to have a future of their own making, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans simply suggests that one day, we will make great wives. EOS BOS Will the Minister for Status of Women— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS No, actually, I will not stop. EOS BOS Will she stand up for Canadian women and apologize for her colleague's comments? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand up and share with the House that on Friday, I was with an organization called Women Building Futures. EOS BOS I was with a graduating class of young women, exclusively young women, who are going to become heavy equipment operators in the oil sands. EOS BOS They were thrilled to hear about our Canada job grant, which would support thousands of other young women who want to get into high-paying trades jobs. EOS BOS We will continue to focus on what matters to all Canadians, including women, and that is creating jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as you said, it is time for the usual Thursday question. EOS BOS However, today, we find ourselves in circumstances that are anything but ordinary. EOS BOS There are only four days left before the scheduled end of this session. EOS BOS In these four days, we will see what the priorities of this government are because two days must be allotted for supply days. EOS BOS The budget must be adopted to cover the expenditures required for the proper functioning of the government. EOS BOS Two days are reserved for the opposition. EOS BOS Naturally, as we just saw in question period, there are attempts to rush the usual way of handling labour relations. EOS BOS It will then be a matter of determining the government's priorities. EOS BOS For example, the budget implementation bill provides for an increase in the guaranteed income supplement. EOS BOS We do not believe that it is sufficient, but it is still worth supporting. EOS BOS It is interesting because this is directly related to what is currently happening with pensions. EOS BOS People are retiring without enough money to live on, and the government must help them. EOS BOS At the same time, government policies are such that more people will be retiring with insufficient income. EOS BOS The question is this: what is the government's priority? EOS BOS Does it want to help seniors in need? EOS BOS Does it want to follow up on the proposal by my colleague from Windsor—Tecumseh to deal with the problem of mega-trials, or will they let other Hells Angels go free? EOS BOS What is the government's priority? EOS BOS What is our priority for the next four days? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will give a complete answer by moving a motion. EOS BOS There have been consultations among the parties, and I believe that we will have unanimous consent on this motion. EOS BOS That, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practices of the House, Bill C-2, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (mega-trials) be disposed of at all stages as follows:(a) not more than 1.7 hours shall be allotted for the consideration at second reading;(b) if the bill is not reported back by Wednesday, June 22, 2011 during routine proceedings, it shall be deemed to have been reported from the Committee without amendment;(c) upon being reported from Committee the bill shall be deemed concurred in at report stage and deemed read a third time and passed. EOS BOS Motion EOS
BOS Does the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons have the unanimous consent of the House to propose this motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS BOS The Speaker: The question is on the motion. EOS BOS Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS BOS (Motion agreed to) EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, having dealt with that, I can provide a full answer to the question from my friend, the House leader of the official opposition. EOS BOS We will call Bill C-2, following routine proceedings today. EOS BOS Pursuant to the order just adopted, we will complete the second reading stage of Bill C-2 before we rise. EOS BOS As decided last week, the House will not sit tomorrow, as a courtesy to the New Democratic members, so they may attend their convention in Vancouver. EOS BOS [Translation]On Monday, we will continue debating back-to-work matters. EOS BOS Tuesday, June 21, and Wednesday, June 22, shall be allotted days. EOS BOS On Thursday, we will complete report stage and third reading of Bill C-3, An Act to implement certain provisions of the 2011 budget as updated on June 6, 2011. EOS BOS [English]Should developments arise relating to the current labour matters at Air Canada and Canada Post, it may be necessary to adjust the business of the House, and I will advise members accordingly when that arises. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Minister of International Cooperation told the House that the government has no intention of reopening the abortion debate, but today, Canadians are hearing quite another story. EOS BOS In a press conference that was disturbing, to say the least, the member for Kitchener Centre said that he wants the House to reconsider the definition of “human being”. EOS BOS Once and for all, will the government keep its backbenchers in line and unequivocally protect women's reproductive rights? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been very clear: the government will not reopen this debate. EOS
BOS The problem is, Mr. Speaker, it is not open, but we keep talking about it.
							[Translation]Canadians—Some hon. members: Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for Gatineau. EOS
BOS Canadians are well aware that this is a serious situation. EOS BOS Either the government has lost control of its caucus or it supports the comments the member made this morning, which would be vile. EOS BOS The member has levelled a direct attack on women's right to choose. EOS BOS If the government is serious about not reopening the abortion debate, why is it so reluctant to say so? EOS BOS Why not make it loud and clear? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that people will probably continue to debate, but I will put my money on the Prime Minister. EOS BOS He has said very clearly that we have no interest in this debate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, women across Canada today are facing the return of a battle we all hoped had ended years ago. EOS BOS The Conservative member for Kitchener Centre is reopening the debate on a woman's right to choose. EOS BOS Canadian women see this for what it is, an attack on our reproductive rights and on our bodies. EOS BOS Silence from the government is not enough. EOS BOS Its claim of not reopening this old debate is not enough. EOS BOS Will the government stand and pledge to vigorously defend women's rights against these attacks? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government has enacted many pieces of legislation that better protect women and victims in this country. EOS BOS We have no lessons to learn from that party. EOS BOS With respect to the subject that she was just talking about, the Prime Minister has been very clear: the government is not reopening that debate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a bad pattern with the Liberals, like Liberal governments in the past, entitled to their entitlements. EOS BOS Now it is the Minister of Infrastructure. EOS BOS He spent nearly $1 million on an office reno when many Albertans cannot make ends meet. EOS BOS They are losing their homes. EOS BOS They are choosing between wants and needs. EOS BOS Infrastructure money is not getting to projects that provinces need, but the minister sure has a fancy new office with swanky furniture. EOS BOS Why was it more important for the minister to spend money on himself than to keep his promises and actually fund priorities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, before November 4, 2015, Infrastructure Canada did not have a fully dedicated ministerial office. EOS BOS There was no office for the department's deputy minister either. EOS BOS Also, there was no office space for our employees. EOS BOS This file is important to our government, which is why these positions were created. EOS BOS Accordingly, offices should be furnished for the minister, the deputy minister, and the employees. EOS BOS The department followed all the Treasury Board directives and that will always be the case. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives do not seem to understand that part of the job of government is to actually serve Canadians. EOS BOS Tax time is just around the corner. EOS BOS So far, the Conservatives have already stopped letting Canadians file by phone, and with very little warning, they have stopped mailing tax forms out. EOS BOS Now the estimates show another $100 million in cuts coming to the CRA.While the Prime Minister's appointed senators fudge their paperwork, honest, hard-working Canadians are trying to play by the rules. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives making it so hard for Canadians to even file their taxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the way Canadians file their taxes is changing, and we are changing to meet those needs. EOS BOS We certainly encourage Canadians to file online, and more and more are taking advantage of that opportunity in a safe and secure way, but they can still use paper. EOS BOS They simply need to go to the post office or pick up the phone. EOS BOS We are accepting paper filing. EOS BOS It is important to acknowledge that last year, 1.3 million packages were mailed out that were not used. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are creating a lot of confusion by changing the rules about filing taxes. EOS BOS Forms are no longer being mailed out, it is no longer possible to file by phone, and the Conservatives have even changed the rules about filing online. EOS BOS Where will taxpayers go for help? EOS BOS Will they go to their local CRA office? EOS BOS No, those were shut down in March. EOS BOS Will they go to their post office? EOS BOS No, because the Conservatives shut many of them down with their massive cuts. EOS BOS Even the ones that are still open do not have enough French forms. EOS BOS What is worse, the volunteer program that helps community groups has been axed. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives making it so difficult for Canadians who simply want to play by the rules? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is really important that CRA adapt to the changes in terms of how Canadians are filing their taxes. EOS BOS There still is a very robust volunteer program that is supported by CRA in terms of helping seniors. EOS BOS I do think it is important to recognize again that 1.3 million packages were mailed out that were never used. EOS BOS I think that is a waste. EOS BOS Certainly, the post office is still available. EOS BOS If they simply pick up the phone, packages will be mailed out. EOS BOS Again, CRA is there to meet the needs of Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more frustrating than paying $2, $3, $4 or $7 to receive an invoice or bank statement. EOS BOS It is an abuse by financial institutions, which make huge profits. EOS BOS If the government is acknowledging that this is an unfair practice on the part of telecommunications companies, it should also acknowledge that it is unfair on the part of banks. EOS BOS That would make sense to me. EOS BOS Why does the government let banks charge unreasonable fees to Canadians who want a paper statement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in the 2013 throne speech and 2014 budget, the government promised to put an end to pay-to-pay billing practices. EOS BOS Canadian consumers should not have to pay more to receive paper statements. EOS BOS Major banks do not charge clients for any credit card statements or other statements indicating amounts owing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, then why is there a double standard? EOS BOS Why is he allowing the banks to get away with charging it but not in stopping the telecoms? EOS BOS It absolutely makes no sense. EOS BOS The Conservatives promised to end these types of pay-to-pay policies, but if we read the fine print, the banks are exempted. EOS BOS Canadians have been loud and clear. EOS BOS These cash grabs are unfair. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives picking and choosing which Canadian consumers get ripped off by these fees? EOS BOS Why will the minister not stand up to the banks and end the gouging of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I already said, for credit cards and other statements that show a payment owing, all major banks are mailing bills to their customers without charge. EOS BOS Let me quote John Lawford of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS Consumers are clearly opposed to paying for paper bills and the federal government has clearly committed to ‘ EOS BOS eliminating’ these charges.” EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a government report says that foreign students at Canadian universities benefit our economy, with greater brainpower, innovation and productivity. EOS BOS The minister says he wants more of them to stay, but his treatment of two Nigerian students in Regina sends the contradictory message that foreign students risk unfair, inconsistent and arbitrary abuses of power based on disinformation. EOS BOS Both the University of Regina and the Government of Saskatchewan oppose deportation of these two young women for a small honest mistake. EOS BOS Will the minister agree? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the truth is the opposite of what the member for Wascana just suggested. EOS BOS First of all, one of the students told the CBSA that she had not been enrolled in classes and had been academically disqualified, and she had documents confirming that. EOS BOS Secondly, the system is of course not administered in an arbitrary or political fashion, but rather in an objective fashion, in this instance by the Immigration and Refugee Board. EOS BOS Both of these individuals had hearings before the immigration division before receiving exclusion orders. EOS BOS Both of their social insurance numbers indicated that they did not have permission to work in Canada. EOS BOS We are open to legal immigrants and to foreign students. EOS BOS We merely ask that people respect our fair rules. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's prisons agenda in Bill C-10 is being rammed through despite overwhelming opposition from all sides. EOS BOS Police chiefs say it is unbalanced. EOS BOS The Canadian Bar Association and crown prosecutors say it will overload our justice system. EOS BOS The provinces are unable to pick up the tab. EOS BOS Even the government itself recognized flaws and proposed amendments here today, which were ruled out of order. EOS BOS Why is the government's approach to go it alone? EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives refuse to work with others on crime prevention and insist on rushing through this flawed bill? EOS </s> BOS First of all, Mr. Speaker, when we want to talk police officers we only have to consult with our own caucus here because of all the police officers who are part of the Conservative caucus. EOS BOS That being said, as long as the hon. EOS BOS member is raising the matter, Chief Vern White, from the Ottawa Police Service, said, “ EOS BOS We do believe that minimum sentences in relation to the charges or offences identified in this legislation would assist us”.Superintendent Don Spicer, from the Halifax Regional Police, said, “ EOS BOS The current sentencing norms simply do not reflect the public's expectations and the only way for Parliament to achieve balance is through mandatory minimums”.This should have the support of the hon. EOS BOS member and everyone in this House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the opposition has put forth practical amendments that will make our communities safer. EOS BOS Why will the Conservatives not vote for these? EOS BOS Why are they barrelling ahead on this unbalanced approach of going it alone? EOS BOS Where is the commitment to the police chiefs who are calling for a balance, to our provincial partners and to families who want to see more front-line police to keep our streets safe? EOS BOS How much are taxpayers going to have to pay for this prisons agenda just because the Conservatives are incapable of working with others? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member never asked what victims will have to pay if we do not change the laws. EOS BOS The NDP has trouble with the idea of going after violent criminals and child pornographers and those who molest children. EOS BOS Why do they not stop attacking farmers who want to sell their wheat or have a long gun? EOS BOS Why not start attacking violent criminals just to mix it up for a change? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they will say just about anything. We have already voted for harsher sentences for pedophiles. EOS BOS By going against the recommendations of the provinces and experts, the Conservatives are preparing to throw hundreds of millions of dollars out the window, not to mention putting all those people in jail without it having a deterrent effect. EOS BOS To act in this way is to ignore Quebec's 40 years of expertise in rehabilitation. EOS BOS The government claims to be tough on crime, but imposing this bill will only make the situation worse and will stick the provinces with an enormous bill. EOS BOS Will this government realize that this money does not belong to it but to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we recognize that Quebec has jurisdiction over criminal justice and can take action with regard to rehabilitation. EOS BOS In fact, Minister Fournier came to see us and we agreed to one of the three recommendations he made. EOS BOS What is more interesting is that Premier Charest sent two of his ministers to try to discuss the necessary amendments. EOS BOS Why did he not have faith in the NDP opposition? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver harbour in 1914 carrying 376 passengers of Indian descent, most of whom were not allowed to land. EOS BOS After two months under difficult conditions, the ship and most of its passengers were forced to return to India, where in a subsequent clash with British soldiers, 19 passengers died. EOS BOS Would the Minister of State for Multiculturalism please inform the House about what our government is doing to commemorate and educate Canadians about this tragic event? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the tragic events of the Komagata Maru truly are a regrettable chapter in Canada's immigration history. EOS BOS Our Prime Minister is the first prime minister in Canadian history to apologize on behalf of Canadians for that tragedy. EOS BOS Further to that, Canada Post released an historic stamp earlier this year. EOS BOS We funded multimedia education materials. EOS BOS We funded a permanent monument in Vancouver, a museum to further educate Canadians, and a great exhibit, called “ EOS BOS Lions of the Sea” EOS BOS , which will be going right across the country. EOS BOS I encourage Canadians to visit it when it is in their part of the country. EOS BOS While the opposition plays politics with this issue, we are working to educate Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, whereas China and the United States have struck a deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the most recent Canada-U.S. air quality agreement presented by the Minister of the Environment makes no mention of regulations for the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS Does that mean that the Minister of the Environment does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions produced by the oil and gas sector affect air quality? EOS BOS I am just saying. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we are the first government in Canadian history to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we have done so without the NDP-Liberal carbon tax. EOS BOS Given the current conditions in the oil and gas sector, it would be reckless economic policy to unilaterally impose greenhouse gas emission regulations and penalties on the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS This is an integrated industry, and regulations on greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas sector must be done on a continental basis. EOS BOS Our government is reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while preserving, protecting and creating Canadian jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is sad not to get an answer. EOS BOS Yesterday, we were shocked to hear the Prime Minister say that it would be crazy to impose greenhouse gas emission regulations on the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS To do nothing is the most irresponsible approach. EOS BOS Climate change is already costing Canadians billions of dollars. EOS BOS We are going to miss the boat on the green economy while the United States and China are already on board. EOS BOS Is there something we should know about the Prime Minister's refusal to establish a strategy to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what would be irresponsible is what the NDP and Liberals want to do, which is unilaterally put in regulations in the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS We said that we will not do this. EOS BOS This is a North American issue and we need a North American solution. EOS BOS We have always said that we want to work collaboratively with the Obama administration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS We are the first government in Canadian history to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we have done so without their carbon tax. EOS BOS Canadians have a very clear choice. EOS BOS They know that we are the only party they can trust to lower greenhouse gas emissions, while protecting the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, welcome to parliamentary secretary day. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that no other country was regulating oil and gas, but a briefing note from Environment Canada explains that in fact the United States is already regulating oil and gas. EOS BOS It says, “ EOS BOS For oil and gas, recent air pollution regulations are expected to result in significant GHG reduction”.Did the Minister of the Environment ever read that briefing note? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when we talk about greenhouse gas emissions going down, it is our party, and the numbers speak for themselves. EOS BOS Between 2005 and 2012, greenhouse gases in Canada went down 5.1%, while our economy grew 10.6%. EOS BOS This is a big difference between our party and the irresponsible policies of the NDP and the Liberals. EOS BOS We want to work together collaboratively with the United States to ensure we have a sector-by-sector approach that works on a continental basis. EOS BOS We will do that without a job-killing carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister thinks there should be a continental-wide regulatory system for oil and gas. EOS BOS Given that he used that as an excuse for Conservative inaction, could the Minister of the Environment tell us about any proposals that she has given to the Americans for such a regulatory system? EOS BOS Where are these proposals, or are they just made up as well? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of our record. EOS BOS Internationally, we are a founding member of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition EOS BOS . We have made significant investments to help support green energy and infrastructure internationally. EOS BOS We have one of the cleanest systems in the world. EOS BOS We have already regulated the transportation and electricity sectors, and we are planning to reduce HFCs, one of the fastest-growing greenhouse gases in the entire world. EOS BOS Thanks to our actions, carbon emissions will go down close to 130 megatonnes from what they would have been under the Liberals, and we have done it all without a carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the call for the expression of interest for the northern greenhouse initiative opened less than a month ago. EOS BOS Projects to increase food security in the north should be a priority, but many communities, farmers, and individuals are not aware of the program or that the call for the expression of interest is open, let alone that it closes tomorrow. EOS BOS Will the minister consider extending the deadline and ensuring that all those concerned, northerners included, are aware of this program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the program was announced in the Northwest Territories over the summer tour. EOS BOS The information is available online. EOS BOS Information is available through the NRCan website. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General has shown that the nutrition north criteria are not fair or accessible. EOS BOS They are not even based on current needs. EOS BOS Forty-six isolated fly-in northern communities are out in the cold, without access to nutritious and affordable food. EOS BOS Will the government commit today to working with all northerners to develop a sustainable solution to food insecurity?The minister can start by including these 46 communities in the nutrition north program. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but add that if they were able to impose this carbon tax, it would be even colder. EOS BOS The cost of food would go up, and the cost of hunting everything in the north would go up. EOS BOS We have accepted the recommendations of the Auditor General, and we are currently examining eligibility criteria. EOS BOS We are collecting data from the communities in the north, and we will review the eligibility criteria. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is no clear commitment there when it comes to banks. EOS BOS Actually, what they are saying is, “If you are being ripped off by banks who are charging pay to pay fees, this government is not going to stand up for you.”On the subject of refugees, refugees are fleeing persecution. EOS BOS They arrive in this country with nothing but hope for a better life. EOS BOS Now the Conservatives are cutting them off, and they are hiding it in an omnibus bill. EOS BOS If the minister really insists on standing by this heartless attack, will he at least agree to a full and open debate? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on a day when the House is, for the most part, given over to non-partisan commemoration of one of our fallen soldiers, it would be nice if the NDP did not spread utter misinformation about the nature of the bill. EOS BOS Refugees are absolutely unaffected by the measures in the bill. EOS BOS We are simply establishing the authority for provinces to have a minimum residence time in the country for categories of persons, not including refugees, should they wish to use it. EOS BOS It is a provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS We respect that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister needs to stop hiding behind the provinces and face the potential consequences of his own decisions. EOS BOS He cannot deny that the government decided to bury a private member's bill in the middle of this omnibus budget implementation bill, in the middle of these 478 pages. EOS BOS The bill was controversial because it allows the provinces to take away refugees' welfare benefits. EOS BOS The minister cannot allow the provinces or anyone else to target refugees and their children like this. EOS BOS He must take these inhumane measures out of the omnibus bill. EOS BOS Is he willing to do that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, instead, the member should stop spewing this completely false rhetoric. EOS BOS We are simply establishing minimum residency requirements for people other than refugees, if the provinces and territories wish to use them. EOS BOS It is a provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS We respect that. EOS BOS The provinces will continue to set the ground rules for social assistance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, by this point Canadians are catching on to a pattern with the Conservatives. EOS BOS When the Conservatives get caught doing something wrong, they blame someone else. EOS BOS The latest attempt in this sorry saga is the Minister of the Environment's attempt to cover up his muzzling of scientists by blaming the media. EOS BOS The problem, he says, is a few grumpy journalists. EOS BOS It is another Conservative attack on democracy, this time by denigrating the fourth estate. EOS BOS Will the minister retract this absurd accusation and admit that his heavy-handed communications protocols are keeping good science out of the hands of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said any number of times in this House, Canadians can be proud of their scientists, particularly of the scientists working at Environment Canada and the contributions they make to science journals and the general media. EOS BOS Our department continues to make its experts available to the media on a regular basis, many hundreds of times, in fact, in the past year. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, the Canadian Science Writers' Association, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression and even the journal Nature and the BBC all denounce the fact that the Conservatives are muzzling researchers by limiting their access to the media. EOS BOS When will this government come up with a clear policy that protects the rights of scientists to inform Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no government in the history of Canada has invested so much in our scientists and researchers. EOS BOS In fact, our scientists and researchers have more work to do and more research to publish as a result of our historic levels of funding, which were voted against by the opposition. EOS BOS We are very happy to see Canadian scientists at symposia and conferences all around the world sharing their work, publishing articles and giving thousands of interviews. EOS BOS The NDP members are way off base. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, it takes so long for the Canada Revenue Agency to deal with files that families in my riding are losing up to six or seven months of benefits before receiving anything. EOS BOS That is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS These families are already struggling to make ends meet, and the CRA is making things worse for them. EOS BOS Perhaps the Liberals should wake up before we have another catastrophe like Phoenix on our hands. EOS BOS The federal government has been boasting about so-called investments in the CRA. EOS BOS Will the government hire more staff to meet the needs of families and individuals who are struggling to earn a decent living? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the CRA provides quality services to Canadians. EOS BOS It is unacceptable that some Canadians are not receiving their credits and benefits within a reasonable period of time. EOS BOS Many vulnerable Canadians depend on these credits and benefits to get by, and we will redouble our efforts to make them more accessible. EOS BOS I would like to remind Canadians of how important it is to file their income tax return in order to receive the credits and benefits they are entitled to. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while our competitors in the United States are busy cutting taxes and making it easier to get to yes on energy projects, the Liberal-appointed National Energy Board review panel has recommended layering on even more red tape. EOS BOS It wants to double review timelines to over three years, and make it even harder for job-creating energy projects to be approved in Canada. EOS BOS No amount of additional red tape will turn a pipeline opponent into a pipeline proponent. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals so intent on making it harder for these job-creating energy projects to proceed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member will agree that the National Energy Board that we inherited was not perfect, and I am sure he might agree that significant reform would be a good thing for Canada's energy industry. EOS BOS He might also acknowledge that, since this government took power, three pipelines have been approved. EOS BOS We will now take the recommendations that have been given to us by an expert panel of five who have consulted Canadians, and we will review that with the objective in mind of creating the greatest regulator in the world right here in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the world already thinks we have the best energy regulator in the world. EOS BOS The Prime Minister revealed his true feelings toward the oil sands when he said he would phase them out, and he revealed his true feelings toward Alberta when he said that Canada was not doing well because Albertans were in charge. EOS BOS Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the Liberal-appointed NEB review panel would imply that Calgarians cannot be trusted to independently and professionally evaluate energy projects. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister condemn this anti-Alberta recommendation and stop pitting one region of the country against the other? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of being in Calgary last week, and while in Calgary I was announcing projects with the Government of Alberta to incent the industry, which is not only across Canada but around the world, to be innovative and creative. EOS BOS We have all the respect in the world for the entrepreneurship of Albertans. EOS BOS We are working with them as we move gradually to a lower carbon economy. EOS BOS We wish that the members opposite had as much confidence in the people of Alberta as we do on this side of the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2015, the government will be eliminating the federal tax credit for labour-sponsored funds even though it has not carried out any real impact studies or consultations. EOS BOS According to one study, the gradual withdrawal of the tax credit will halve annual investment in Quebec businesses from $521 million to $250 million in three years. EOS BOS Rather than eliminate the tax credit, will the minister here commit to carrying out a closer review of the labour-sponsored funds' new proposal to create a new partnership with the federal government based on mutual interests? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when we are dealing with taxes, of course, we are attempting to leave more money in the pockets of Canadians. EOS BOS As to the specific tax credit the member is concerned about, I will take it under advisement, and perhaps we can get together and talk a little bit about what he is suggesting here. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians understand that the economy and the environment go hand in hand and that everyone must be involved in a realistic plan to reduce greenhouse gases. EOS BOS In November, the President of the Treasury Board announced that the government will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and that a centre for greening government will be set up to coordinate those efforts. EOS BOS Can the President of the Treasury Board give us an update on this issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to doing its part to create a cleaner and more innovative economy in order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and create good, sustainable jobs for the middle class. EOS BOS [English]
              That is why I was proud today to participate in the launch of the new Centre for Greening Government. EOS BOS We launched a series of round table discussions focused on making sure the Government of Canada was part of the climate change solution. EOS BOS I want to thank the member for Vancouver Quadra, my parliamentary secretary, for her leadership on this file. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a new PBO report says that the Conservative budget for the Arctic patrol ships is insufficient and could mean only three ships would be built rather than six to eight. EOS BOS Whether it is the F-35s, naval supply ships, military helicopters or Arctic patrol ships, the government botches every procurement it touches. EOS BOS Will the government be increasing the budget or buying fewer patrol ships? EOS BOS When will the government come up with a procurement strategy that fixes the nine long years of Conservative incompetence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is time to remind the hon. member that it was his Liberal government that cancelled the Sea Kings and paid half a billion dollars after that. EOS BOS We are still trying to recover from that. EOS BOS The Liberals starved the military for 10 years. EOS BOS On the other hand, as I announced, we cut steel on the first offshore fishery science vessel, part of our national shipbuilding procurement strategy. EOS BOS We have successfully completed procurements for military with the LAVs, heavy-lift aircraft, tactical lift transporters, main battle tanks, new heavy artillery, and many more. EOS BOS We support our men and women in uniform. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with just three weeks left before Kevin Page retires, the government finally released a job description for the next Parliamentary Budget Officer. EOS BOS Shockingly, the new budget officer will be required to achieve consensus among parliamentarians before releasing reports. EOS BOS Fat chance of that happening. EOS BOS Government MPs like to pretend things will cost less than they really do. EOS BOS The budget officer protects against that, but cannot if forced to achieve consensus among the same people doing the pretending. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives manipulating the job description to suit their partisan agenda? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member may have heard me say this before: we intend to see a non-partisan, credible source of opinion on fiscal matters in the next Parliamentary Budget Officer. EOS BOS It is the Library of Parliament that is leading the search for a new PBO. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, telling the truth is no longer in the job description. EOS BOS The Parliamentary Budget Officer does not need to achieve consensus— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for Guelph now has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the budget officer does not need to achieve consensus. EOS BOS The budget officer needs to do rigorous independent analysis of the numbers presented to parliamentarians, not co-operate with the PMO spin machine. EOS BOS The Auditor General job description did not require consensus. EOS BOS The Ethics Commissioner job did not require consensus. EOS BOS It required them to act with integrity and speak the truth. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives looking to hire a lapdog to do their bidding, rather than working hard to protect Canadian tax dollars? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member is in a grumpy mood ever since he was tagged with the robocalls in his riding, but we on this side of the House are in a happy mood: there are 50,000 net new jobs throughout the country. EOS BOS We are taking Canada in the right direction and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, union bosses from CUPW want taxpayers to cover their trip to an anti-Israel conference in Brazil, which advocated the release of Ahmad Sa'adat. EOS BOS Sa'adat heads a banned terrorist group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. EOS BOS Public Safety Canada says this group “took part in some of the boldest terrorist attacks”, hijacking three civilian airliners and using suicide bombers and guerrilla tactics. EOS BOS Sa'adat is imprisoned right now for 30 years for ordering the assassination of an Israeli minister. EOS BOS Does the government still consider Ahmad Sa'adat's PFLP to be a terrorist organization? EOS </s> BOS Yes, we do, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS Convicted murderer and terrorist Ahmad Sa'adat wrote a jailhouse letter thanking conference goers, including the Canadian postal union bosses. EOS BOS Now union bosses plan to use workers' dues to file a grievance because Canada Post refuses to fund the trip to the freedom-for-terrorists conference. EOS BOS Here we have the latest example of union bosses using other people's money to lavish themselves and to fund the most odious of causes. EOS BOS Is it not time for union financial transparency? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all Alberta MPs are hearing from their constituents regarding our unique labour shortages. EOS BOS In fact, the new Alberta premier, our former colleague, Jim Prentice, has indicated that changes to the temporary foreign worker program will be the first order of business he wants to discuss with the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Last week the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association president, Helen Rice, implored the government to reverse the changes announced last spring, stating that Alberta MPs are not listening to Albertans and that Alberta employers desperately need access to both temporary workers and permanent immigration. EOS BOS When will the employment minister and Alberta MPs start listening to Albertans and Albertans' elected representatives and reverse the ill-thought-out changes to the TFW program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the member opposite, we are listening to Albertans who want to ensure that Albertans come first for Alberta jobs and that the temporary foreign worker program is only a last and limited resort. EOS BOS We are concerned about the 110,000 Albertans who have no work but are looking for it. EOS BOS We take note of the growth of the labour force by 100,000 people a year in Alberta. EOS BOS We have seen immigration double since our government came to office EOS BOS . We will continue to work with Albertans to ensure that they get the first crack at available jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here we go again. EOS BOS Another day, another investigation launched as a result of the Prime Minister's questionable cash-for-access events. EOS BOS First, the Ethics Commissioner and now the Commissioner of Lobbying are asking the Prime Minister about his unethical conduct. EOS BOS We already know the Prime Minister has zero regard for the rules and ethics laws, and we learned yesterday that the lobbying commissioner is investigating the Prime Minister's shady cash-for-access events with his wealthy lobbyist friends. EOS BOS Has the Prime Minister been questioned by the Commissioner of Lobbying regarding his cash-for-access fundraising activity? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. EOS BOS The lobbying commissioner looks at the activity of lobbyists. EOS BOS That is what the lobbying commissioner does. EOS BOS Just so everyone in the House is able to hear, the lobbying commissioner looks at the activities of lobbyists. EOS BOS This side of the House is working hard for Canadians, working hard for middle-class Canadians and those wanting to join it, so we can make the investments to help create the growth Canadians need us to create. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the lobbying commissioner is clearly looking at lobbyists who are lobbying the Prime Minister, which only makes sense as the Prime Minister and the House leader think this all is a big joke. EOS BOS The Prime Minister thinks he is untouchable. EOS BOS It is the Prime Minister's conduct and lack of ethics that has him under several investigations by multiple commissioners. EOS BOS It is hard, actually, for Canadians to keep track of them all. EOS BOS The lobbying commissioner is now investigating the Prime Minister's cash-for-access events. EOS BOS We know he does not answer his own questions in the House. EOS BOS Therefore, will the Prime Minister answer the lobbying commissioner's questions or will he send the government House leader to answer questions for him? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all of us have been elected to this place to do the good work Canadians expect us to do. EOS BOS The difference between the Conservatives and this government is that this government is taking unprecedented levels of consultation with Canadians so we can respond to the very real challenges they are facing. EOS BOS This government will continue to work hard for Canadians. EOS BOS This government will continue to respond to the very real challenges they are facing, because that is what we were elected to do. EOS BOS With regard to the lobbying commissioner, it is important to inform the member that the lobbying commissioner looks at the interests of lobbyists. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with so many investigations going on, Canadians heads are literally spinning from the Liberal sunny ways. EOS BOS Here is a tally: ministers using the power of their office to fundraise for the Liberal Party; secret getaways on private helicopters; inside deals for Chinese billionaires after big donations to the Trudeau Foundation; and now, illegal fundraising with lobbyists. EOS BOS The Liberal ethical lapses go on and on. EOS BOS Why do Liberals and the Prime Minister act like the Liberals who have sat in those seats before them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to repeat the answer the member has received. EOS BOS It is interesting that members opposite choose to keep repeating the same questions, but never understand why they get the same answers. EOS BOS When it comes to the lobbyist commissioner, the lobbyist commissioner looks at the activity of lobbyists. EOS BOS When it comes to previous fundraising activities, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has said that no rules were broken. EOS BOS Members opposite might choose to focus on work that others need to do, but we will focus on work that Canadians want us to do. EOS BOS That is why we are responding to the very real challenges they are facing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been in office for 18 months and is already under investigation by a number of commissioners, including the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS That is unheard of for a Canadian prime minister. EOS BOS Even though the Gomery commission brought to light the Liberals' questionable ethics, they clearly did not learn anything from their 10-year exile. EOS BOS How many times will the Prime Minister have to be investigated before he finally puts an end to his questionable practices and flexible ethics? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am being asked the same question so I will give the same answer. EOS BOS Let us be clear. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Lobbying looks at activities of lobbyists. EOS BOS With respect to the recent fundraising activities, the commissioner has said that no rules were broken. EOS BOS We are going to continue to work for Canadians in order to respond to the very real challenges they are facing. EOS BOS That is what we were elected to do, and we are going to continue to work hard for them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago today, world leaders, MPs and NGOs gathered here in Ottawa to sign the Ottawa treaty to ban anti-personnel landmines, which unanimously passed. EOS BOS Since then, Canada has been one of the leading funders for the removal effort. EOS BOS However, under the Conservative government, the funding for the landmine clearance has been cut. EOS BOS Canada has gone from being in the top five to, now, number ten. EOS BOS Will the government commit to renew funding for the landmines clearance and return Canada to a leadership role? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians can be very proud of the role our government played in the Ottawa treaty. EOS BOS Lloyd Axworthy, one of my predecessors, as a distinguished foreign minister, worked very hard on this issue. EOS BOS Canada continues to be a top 10 funder of this. EOS BOS Canada also has other priorities and other challenges that it seeks to tackle, particularly the Prime Minister's leadership on maternal health. EOS BOS It is something that Canadians can be equally excited about, the international leadership that has been shown by another Government of Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday of this week, April 3, 2012, you had the honour of tabling in this House the 2012 report of the Auditor General. EOS BOS The Auditor General, of course, is an officer of Parliament and the reports tabled through you by his office are presumed to be an accurate reflection of the issues his office undertook to examine. EOS BOS As such, all members of this place operate on the assumption that the contents of the Auditor General's report, tabled by the Speaker, are reliable enough to base not only questions and comments, but also for the government and, if necessary, Parliament, to act upon, whether through administrative reforms or legislative measures. EOS BOS That is my first very simple point. EOS BOS My second point is that the proceedings of the House are based on a long-standing tradition of respect for the tradition of members. EOS BOS There has to be a presumption that all members of the House are speaking the truth, based upon their knowledge of a particular issue. EOS BOS That assumption is in fact the basis of our parliamentary system. EOS BOS For generations we have assumed that people could be taken at their word, that when members of Parliament say something in this House, whether they are members of the opposition or members of the executive, we take it as a matter of our ongoing work as parliamentarians that those words are in fact the truth, as members know as they are stating them. EOS BOS Speaker Fraser, in a decision on a question of privilege, in the Debates of May 5, 1987, stated in part that the institution of Parliament enjoys “the protection of absolute privilege because of the overriding need to ensure that the truth can be told”.I am beginning from the premise that all members, cabinet members included, who speak in this place are speaking the truth. EOS BOS We have to assume that when the Prime Minister of Canada is speaking in this place, he is speaking the truth. EOS BOS We have to assume that when the Minister of National Defence is speaking in this place, he is speaking the truth. EOS BOS When the Minister of Public Works and Government Services is speaking in this place, she is speaking the truth. EOS BOS When the Associate Minister of National Defence is speaking, he is speaking the truth. EOS BOS I am reminded of Speaker Milliken's ruling on March 9, 2011, which dealt with the issues of the contradictory statements of the Minister of International Cooperation regarding the Christian charity, KAIROS. EOS BOS In his ruling, where he ruled that there was a prima facie case of privilege, Speaker Milliken said:—members have argued that the minister has made statements in committee that are different from those made in the House or provided to the House in written form. EOS BOS Indeed, these members have argued that the material available shows that contradictory information has been provided. EOS BOS As a result, they argue, this demonstrates that the minister has deliberately misled the House and that as such, a prima facie case of privilege exists. EOS BOS He then went on to quote from a ruling delivered by Speaker Jerome on March 21, 1978, which said:
							—the Speaker should ask himself, when he has to decide whether to grant precedence over other public business to a motion which a Member who has complained of some act or conduct as constituting a breach of privilege desires to move, should be not— EOS BOS do I consider that, assuming that the facts are as stated, the act or conduct constitutes a breach of privilege, but could it reasonably be held to be a breach of privilege, or to put it shortly, has the Member an arguable point? EOS BOS If the Speaker feels any doubt on the question, he should, in my view, leave it to the House. EOS BOS At the time the member for Scarborough—Rouge River indicated to the House:That has confused me. EOS BOS It has confused Parliament. EOS BOS It has confused us in our exercise of holding the government to account, whether it is the Privy Council, whether it is the minister, whether it is public officials; we cannot do our job when there is that type of confusion. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, Milliken also said:—the situation before us where the House is left with two versions of events is one that merits further consideration by an appropriate committee, if only to clear the air. EOS BOS The Speaker went on to say that in his view there was sufficient doubt to warrant a finding of prima facie privilege in that particular case. EOS BOS If these arguments are correct, and I would argue that they are, we have a problem that requires attention, and I believe a ruling with respect to the matter of truthfulness in statements by members of the government is now clearly warranted. EOS BOS Yesterday I raised this matter as it concerns the Auditor General's 2012 report. EOS BOS Chapter 2 of that report, entitled “ EOS BOS Replacing Canada's Fighter Jets”, contains the following at page 3 under the heading “ EOS BOS The departments have responded”:National Defence, Industry Canada and Public Works and Government Services Canada have accepted the facts presented in the chapter. EOS BOS Both National Defence and Public Works and Government Services Canada disagree with the conclusions set out in paragraphs 2.80 and 2.81. EOS BOS (1215)I would draw the House's attention to the last sentence, which states that the two departments in question disagree with the conclusions set out in paragraphs 2.80 and 2.81 of the report of the Auditor General. EOS BOS Given the severity of the situation that has been raised in regard to the issue of the F-35, and bearing in mind that the two paragraphs to which I will now refer appear in the Auditor General's report under the heading “ EOS BOS Conclusion”, I wish to place these two paragraphs on the public record prior to raising the specific matters as privilege. EOS BOS I am quoting now from the Auditor General's report in full. EOS BOS These are the two paragraphs in which we are told by the Auditor General of Canada, which he confirmed this morning in committee when asked this question, that the departments in question challenge the conclusions of the Auditor General, namely paragraphs 2.80 and 2.81:
							National Defence did not exercise due diligence in managing the process to replace the CF-18 jets. EOS BOS National Defence did not appropriately consult Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) on the procurement implications of the 2006 MOU for the third phase of the JSF Program or develop an appropriate plan for managing the unique aspects of the acquisition. EOS BOS Problems relating to development of the F-35 were not fully communicated to decision makers, and risks presented to decision makers did not reflect the problems the JSF Program was experiencing at the time. EOS BOS Full life-cycle costs were understated in the estimates provided to support the government's 2010 decision to buy the F-35. EOS BOS Some costs were not fully provided to parliamentarians. EOS BOS For emphasis, I am going to repeat that statement: Some costs were not fully provided to parliamentarians. EOS BOS The report then continued: There was a lack of timely and complete documentation to support the procurement strategy decision. EOS BOS Paragraph 2.81 reads as follows:PWGSC did not demonstrate due diligence in its role as the government's procurement authority. EOS BOS Although it was engaged by National Defence until late in the decision-making process, PWGSC relied almost exclusively on assertions by National Defence and endorsed the sole-source procurement strategy in the absence of required documentation and completed analysis. EOS BOS Those are the two sections, which I have just read into the record. EOS BOS Since this report was presented to the House, the government, through the Prime Minister, the Minister of National Defence, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, the Associate Minister of National Defence and the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, has responded. EOS BOS The following are representative of the line of argument by the government. EOS BOS The Associate Minister of National Defence said, “ EOS BOS We do in fact accept the conclusions of the Auditor General, and we will in fact implement his recommendations”. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence said, “We have said that we accept his conclusions”. EOS BOS The Associate Minister of National Defence said, “we accept the conclusions of the Auditor General”. EOS BOS The Minister of Public Works and Government Services said, “ EOS BOS I say to the member that our government believes very strongly the Auditor General's recommendations and conclusions were accurate, and we agree with them”. EOS BOS The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons said, “ EOS BOS The government has clearly expressed, through the ministers here, the views we have that we accept the findings of the Auditor General and the recommendations”.At no point has any member of the government stated in this place that both National Defence and Public Works and Government Services Canada in fact “disagree with the conclusions” of the Auditor General, a declaration that is clearly self-evident in the report itself. EOS BOS In fact, as I have indicated, statements made in the House have been categorical. EOS BOS The government, according to the record of this place, accepts the conclusions of the Auditor General, which as a point of fact is misleading, erroneous and, if I may say so, best suited to an unparliamentary term. EOS BOS The point I raise is not a matter of interpretation and it is not a matter of debate. EOS BOS It is clear that two completely different and contradictory versions of reality are being presented in the House by the government. EOS BOS In response to oral questions, the government accepts all conclusions of the Auditor General, while in a written submission to the House through its response to the Auditor General's report, the government rejects several critical conclusions of the Auditor General. EOS BOS These two versions of reality cannot both be true. EOS BOS One in fact must be a falsehood. EOS BOS While it is not for the Speaker to determine what is fact, what is clear is that the two versions of reality leave the House with significant confusion on this issue. EOS BOS Indeed, I would argue that these two versions seem to be an attempt to deliberately confuse the House. EOS BOS (1220)It should be noted that the ministers in this House were apprised of the findings of the report prior to it being tabled in this House, as demonstrated by the fact that the report contains statements from the departments affected and how they have responded. EOS BOS It is my contention and first argument, based upon the conflicting versions of reality delivered by the government in this place in response to the Auditor General's report concerning the F-35 procurement process, that in fact this is not just a question of my privileges—it is not a question of personal privilege—but a question of the privileges of this House. EOS BOS I also want to make an additional argument, because I think it is critical that the House comes to grips with this question. EOS BOS If in fact it is true that the government accepts the conclusions of the Auditor General's report, the Government of Canada is admitting that for a period of 21 months it misled the Parliament of Canada. EOS BOS By way of debate, the government is saying,“Well, it's okay because there are no consequences, there are no financial consequences to this, so it doesn't matter”. EOS BOS One minister of the crown even got up to say, “ EOS BOS Don't ask us questions about this. EOS BOS Only ask us questions about something which really matters, like the economy.”There is nothing more fundamental to this House than the fact that this House be told the truth by its government. EOS BOS [Translation]Something else surfaced in the media today. EOS BOS The Auditor General made a presentation to a parliamentary committee today, but he also said things to the media outside the House. EOS BOS He surprised us all by telling the media that members of the executive council were aware of the facts and of the costs related to the contract even as they attacked opposition members and an officer of Parliament, the Parliamentary Budget Officer. EOS BOS This means that for a long time, the members of the executive council knew that what they were saying in the House of Commons was not true. EOS BOS Frankly, I cannot imagine a harsher, clearer criticism of the government. EOS BOS The government cannot say that, while it accepts the conclusions in the report, they do not really matter. EOS BOS If it accepts the conclusions in the Auditor General's report, it must accept the facts that are clearly stated within it: the government did not tell the truth to members of the House of Commons. EOS BOS On the contrary, it repeatedly attacked members and officers of the House even though it knew the truth. EOS BOS That is why I believe that there is clearly a matter of privilege here. EOS BOS [English]It is not a matter of privilege for one member of this House alone. EOS BOS This has to do with the fundamental obligation of a government to tell the truth, to tell the truth to Parliament. EOS BOS The Auditor General has concluded that, in fact, Parliament was misled. EOS BOS If the government accepts that conclusion, I would argue, Mr. Speaker, that you have no alternative but to find that there is a question of privilege. EOS BOS If the government now recoils and says it continues to object to the two paragraphs that I have read out, then we also have a question of privilege, because what the government is stating in this House is completely contrary to what it is arguing in the document itself. EOS BOS The government cannot have it both ways. EOS BOS We have to be clear on this. EOS BOS It does not end here. EOS BOS We cannot have a Parliament without truth and without consequences. EOS BOS There has to be a Parliament with truth and with consequences. EOS BOS Just to be clear, Mr. Speaker, if you find it is a question of privilege, I will be coming forward with a motion for the House to consider, with respect to how we deal with the matter. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the leader of the third party is frustrated that he does not have the opportunity to present opposition day speeches and debates as often as he might otherwise have if the Liberals were the official opposition, as they formerly were. EOS BOS Essentially, that is what we have had. EOS BOS I have heard nothing in the way of any meaningful question of privilege that can be addressed here. EOS
BOS Let the Speaker decide that. EOS </s> BOS The fact is, in the report of the Auditor General, the Auditor General was somewhat critical and cast questions on the conduct and diligence of officials. EOS
BOS Your nose is somewhat growing. EOS </s> BOS It is absolutely understandable that officials in the affected departments would want to defend and explain their actions. EOS BOS That is what has been reported by the Auditor General in his report. EOS BOS In the sections that said that the officials in those two departments, not the government, took issue, I can understand the actual inclination for them to want to do it. EOS BOS However, the position of the government is not the position taken by the officials in those departments. EOS BOS The position of the government, as reported in the House by us, is a position that is taken by the Governor-in-Council. EOS BOS It is a position that is taken by cabinet. EOS BOS We have had the opportunity and the benefit of reading the Auditor General's report, taking into account all the facts related in it, the information that has been provided, including the efforts by members of the department to explain their actions. EOS BOS The fact is, having considered all those findings and having considered those recommendations, cabinet, the Governor-in-Council, agrees with the Auditor General. EOS
BOS And he said you misled the House. EOS </s> BOS That was not in the report. EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS In questions of privilege of this nature, certainly members are afforded the opportunity to respond. EOS BOS In that the first statement was respected in terms of listening, we would like to afford the same opportunity for the government House leader. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the leader of the opposition may wish that we were bound to take the same position as officials in the department defending their actions. EOS BOS That is not the case here. EOS BOS In fact, that is why the Office of the Auditor General exists, to provide the government and the Canadian public with the opportunity to have this level of oversight and to be able to rely on that opinion, those findings, that advice and that work of the Auditor General. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing in this case and that is what the actions we are taking reflect as well. EOS BOS In terms of any question of what has been said to Parliament, a very important point to understand, and it is the same point the Auditor General has expressed in his report, is that as a government, as ministers, as a cabinet, we have a right and an expectation that the advice we receive is something on which we can rely. EOS BOS This is something that, in this case, the Auditor General made some findings on. EOS BOS We happen to agree with those findings in the end. EOS BOS In this case there is no privilege or question of any efforts to have misled Parliament. EOS BOS The Auditor General has spoken to it quite clearly and quite completely, laying out the circumstances in which that occurred, and we happen to agree with the Auditor General. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we just heard the argument from the member for Toronto Centre, so I would like to reserve our opportunity to come back after the break with a more fulsome comment. EOS BOS I want to get this on the record now. EOS BOS It is clear that when we hear what the Auditor General has said, every one of us as members of Parliament has to think if our privileges have been breached. EOS BOS On a preliminary basis, our analysis is that it is still premature to determine that. EOS BOS I say that from the perspective of the Speaker having to make an ultimate ruling on this motion. EOS BOS However, we are still analyzing all the information we have. EOS BOS As the leader of the third party mentioned, more information came out in a scrum this morning from the Auditor General. EOS BOS Therefore, we are doing that analysis. EOS BOS Both for the reason that we have heard the arguments for the first time and for the reality of the need to continue to do that analysis, I ask for the right to be able to respond after the break. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will be addressing the same point and I will be brief. EOS BOS The leader of the Liberal Party spoke eloquently in his presentation on the fiasco that the whole plan, the whole program to purchase these F-35 jets represents. EOS BOS However, I have to add one thing: it is very rare for this government to admit that it has made an error. EOS BOS That has to be recognized. EOS BOS The Conservatives have been in power since 2006, and even when they were in a minority position, never once did they admit that they had made an error. EOS BOS This time, they have done that, more or less, by transferring or, if you like, shovelling the entire matter over to the Department of Public Works. EOS BOS They are so prideful, however, that they have decided to call it the F-35 Secretariat. EOS BOS So to them, this does not mean reviewing the competition process, seeing whether there was a real need to buy these jets, and also reviewing the entire defence or even foreign affairs policy. EOS BOS And that means that after all the information we have had from the Auditor General and the statistics provided by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, we can be certain that not just this House, but the public as a whole has been misled by the Conservative government in this matter. EOS BOS Ultimately, what we have to remember, and I will conclude on this point, is that it is the public who will be paying all those billions of dollars in this whole F-35 fiasco. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, having heard the hon. EOS BOS member for Toronto Centre and the points from the hon. EOS BOS member for Windsor—Tecumseh, I want to make this one point very clearly. EOS BOS On behalf of the Green Party of Canada, I would like to associate myself with every point made by the member for Toronto Centre. EOS BOS Also, I agree with the member for Windsor—Tecumseh that there are more facts to be uncovered and more information to be gained. EOS BOS I have felt offended by hearing government members in the House claim that they have accepted, and that their departments have accepted, the findings of the Auditor General, when in black and white in the report of the Auditor General, it says very clearly, at page 31, chapter 2: Both National Defence and Public Works and Government Services Canada disagree with our conclusion that they did not demonstrate due diligence in their respective roles in the replacement of the CF-18 jets. EOS BOS I believe there is a clear contradiction there. EOS BOS I know the Speaker will take time and consider carefully the points of the hon. EOS BOS member for Toronto Centre with which we agree on every syllable. EOS </s> BOS I would like to thank the hon. EOS BOS member for Toronto Centre for his intervention, the responses from the government House leader and the comments by the member for Richmond—Arthabaska and the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands. EOS BOS The Chair notes that the member for Windsor—Tecumseh would like to reserve an opportunity to speak on the point perhaps after the break. EOS BOS I think there is more than enough here for us to consider in the days ahead. EOS BOS We will take the matter under advisement and get back to the House in due course. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the lack of communication between the Liberals and public servants on Phoenix is extremely frustrating. EOS BOS In my riding, I currently have about 30 open cases to resolve Phoenix issues, and someone is even owed $30,000 in back pay. EOS BOS Many have serious concerns with the year end approaching, and it is especially chaotic for public service pensioners who are retiring before their pay issues are ever resolved. EOS BOS Will the Liberals address these glaring concerns and help Canadians suffering under this horrible system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the difficult position our public servants and their families are in, and we are putting in place a number of measures to help them along the way. EOS BOS First, there are emergency pay services they have access to. EOS BOS We are improving technology. EOS BOS We are working on our governance. EOS BOS We are improving our policies. EOS BOS We are taking steps, and had they been taken in the first place, we would not be in this position. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, representatives from PSAC met with MPs from all parties to highlight the many problems public servants continue to face. EOS BOS The Auditor General has confirmed that Phoenix is a disaster, with no end in sight. EOS BOS Where is the government's plan? EOS BOS We know it appreciates them, but where is the plan? EOS BOS With the holidays and tax season approaching, many public servants will be in for another period of uncertainty and stress. EOS BOS Will the government commit to, at least, covering the tax implication for Phoenix errors for all public servants? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we appreciate that, as the holidays approach and as the year end approaches, it puts our public servants in an incredibly difficult position, given the realities of Phoenix. EOS BOS We are working on improving the technology. EOS BOS We are working on our governance. EOS BOS We are taking the steps necessary both to resolve it in the short term and also to have a state-of-the-art pay system in the long term. EOS BOS We are doing what we can, and quite frankly, we are working very closely with the unions, because this problem will be solved by public servants for public servants. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, from grain to lumber, from chemicals to cars, captive shippers have been asking for legislation since 2007 to provide enforceable level of service contracts. EOS BOS After five years, will we finally see that legislation this week?Without discrimination, will all level of service contracts include six mandatory elements: services and obligations, communication rules, performance standards, performance metrics, consequences for non-performance, and a dispute settlement mechanism? EOS BOS Will we get that legislation this week? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to hear that from a member who has been here for 13 years before and had done absolutely nothing. EOS BOS We will fix it. EOS BOS We said that we would introduce a bill during the fall and we will do it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Bill C-398 proposed simple changes to Canadian legislation, which could have saved thousands of lives at no cost to taxpayers. EOS BOS A number of Conservative members caved in to pressure from the Prime Minister's Office and refused to send the bill to be examined in committee, even though a similar bill was passed by the House in the last Parliament. EOS BOS Why did they vote against streamlining the system, thereby refusing to save lives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not true. EOS BOS The bill would not improve the lives of the people it purported to help. EOS BOS The real question is this: why did the NDP vote against $4 billion in initiatives that would have provided medications to countries in need?The NDP always voted against those initiatives. EOS BOS The $4 billion would have secured a global fund of $10 billion. EOS BOS Those are real initiatives, not just rhetoric. EOS BOS That is real action. EOS BOS Shame on the NDP for voting against them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that sounds like more hollow excuses.Conservatives could have acted. EOS BOS They could have agreed with those around the world who believe that we have a responsibility to act. EOS BOS Even the Toronto Sun lamented the cruel death of this lifesaving bill. EOS BOS Forty-four percent of women, men and children living in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to lifesaving medicines. EOS BOS Why will the Conservatives not put partisan games aside and work together with everyone to ensure that we get lifesaving medicines to the people who need them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not true. EOS BOS This bill would not help the ones that it claims to. EOS BOS The fact is that we put forward $4 billion of initiatives to make sure that medicines are provided to the countries in need, and the NDP always voted against it. EOS BOS The question is why it votes against it when we know that this $4 billion helped to secure a global fund of $10 billion for the countries in need. EOS BOS This is real action, and shame on New Democrats for voting against that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. EOS BOS We represent 15% of Canadians. EOS BOS In 2010, the government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. EOS BOS The agreement stated that in April 2012 a report would be submitted on steps taken to improve the living conditions of Canadians with disabilities. EOS BOS Eight months later, the Conservatives still have not fulfilled their obligations. EOS BOS Where is the report? EOS BOS When will it be tabled? EOS BOS This time, I hope I get a real answer. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no government has done as much as we have to help those with disabilities. EOS BOS For instance, we set up the RDSP to help families save for the future. EOS BOS We have also asked for a report, which I expect to receive very soon, on how to help people with disabilities enter Canada's labour market. EOS BOS We want to help these people, that is what we are doing and we want the NDP's support. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us look at their record instead. EOS BOS Conservatives have refused to adequately fund the public service disability insurance plan and they used the enabling accessibility fund almost exclusively for Conservative ridings, refusing other worthy projects. EOS BOS On this International Day of Persons with Disabilities, it is clear Conservatives have failed to support Canadians with disabilities. EOS BOS When will the government keep its international promises and get behind fair and balanced programs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been doing exactly that, and at every single step of the way the NDP has opposed that action. EOS BOS It has opposed the working income tax benefit. EOS BOS It opposed the enabling accessibility fund that has benefited over 800 new projects that have increased accessibility for all persons within Canada. EOS BOS It even opposed the opportunities fund, which helps Canadians with disabilities prepare for the workplace, to get out there and become more self-reliant and independent. EOS BOS We are the ones working to help people with disabilities become included in society. EOS BOS It is too bad the NDP opposes us every step of the way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals promised an open, transparent, and merit-based appointment process. EOS BOS However, after dragging their feet for months, they appointed a second official languages commissioner because the first one was too partisan, a lobbying commissioner who had actually applied for the position of information commissioner, and a conflict of interest and ethics commissioner who has already been severely rebuked by the Auditor General. EOS BOS How can the Prime Minister tell Canadians that these are the best candidates when the process is so flawed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we established a merit-based appointment process for choosing officers of Parliament and making government appointments that better reflect the diversity and quality of what Canadians have to offer. EOS BOS After 10 years of partisanship, we are proud of the process we have created, and we have great confidence in all our appointments. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says the process is open, but we know nothing about the government's selection criteria. EOS BOS He says it is transparent, but we know nothing about who is on the selection committees. EOS BOS He says it is merit-based, but we know nothing about the candidates. EOS BOS Basically, what he is doing is giving the opposition a piece of paper with a name written on it that came out of nowhere, and then he wants us to comment on that name for seven days. EOS BOS This is what he calls a consultation. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister show some transparency and tell Canadians who was on the selection committee and who the candidates were? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I beg to differ. We have built all kinds of transparency mechanisms into our appointment processes so the public can have confidence in the process. EOS BOS We have made new appointments from coast to coast to coast to ensure that people interested in running for positions in the Senate, on the Supreme Court, or as officers of Parliament are free to do so as part of a process that was far too closed and partisan before we came along. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am beginning to suspect that the Prime Minister does not know what the words “open and transparent” actually mean. EOS BOS The law requires the Prime Minister to meaningfully consult with the other party leaders. EOS BOS What did the Liberals do? EOS BOS They sent us a “take it or leave it” EOS BOS letter with one name on it for a new Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS That is not consultation; that is a sham. EOS BOS Canadians are starting to worry that this Prime Minister does not even care. EOS BOS For a Prime Minister who is actually under an ethics investigation, does he finally understand that we need a credible process to hire the watchdogs who work on behalf of all of us? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nominating an officer of Parliament is an extremely important process that we are glad we have engaged in with the members of the opposition EOS BOS .
               We will continue to consult and ensure that the highest quality of people come forward, and are encouraged to apply, to make sure that our officers of Parliament, and indeed, nominations across the government, whether it be senators or Supreme Court justices, reflect the full skills and diversity this country has to offer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he says “engaged”, but then he sends us a letter that says take it or leave it. EOS BOS New Democrats actually offered the Liberals a solution to this appointments mess, and it would actually help Liberals keep their campaign promise. EOS BOS Do members know what the Liberals did? EOS BOS They voted against it. EOS BOS Let me remind the Prime Minister of Canada one more time: these watchdogs do not work for him. EOS BOS They work for Parliament on behalf of all Canadians. EOS BOS Will he pull the names, restart the process, and finally show a little respect for this place? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is important that the officers of Parliament have the confidence of this House. EOS BOS If the officers of Parliament we have appointed do not have the confidence of the New Democratic Party, let it say so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this evening we will be debating federal funding for the lower Churchill project. EOS BOS The Conservatives, the Liberals and even NDP members from Quebec are ignoring Quebec's two unanimous motions condemning the funding. EOS BOS They are allowing Ottawa to use Quebeckers' money to support a project that will compete directly with Hydro-Québec, a government entity that the Quebec nation built and paid for itself. EOS BOS Will the government take this opportunity, a few hours before the debate, to finally show respect for Quebec and agree not to fund this unfair project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we obviously respect all provinces and all jurisdictions across this country. EOS BOS The lower Churchill project will provide significant economic benefits to the Atlantic region. EOS BOS It will also substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS At peak employment it will provide 3,100 jobs for the Atlantic region and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 4.5 megatonnes. EOS BOS That is the equivalent of over one million cars. EOS BOS Our government's signing of the term sheet for the loan shows our government's support for Newfoundland and Labrador and the Atlantic region. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, negotiations for the global arms treaty resume on March 18. EOS BOS To date, the Conservative government's support for this treaty has been erratic and has taken some extremely regressive positions going into the final rounds of negotiations. EOS BOS Why does the government think that bullets do not need the same risk assessments as the weapons that shoot them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada already has some of the highest global standards in the export control of munitions. EOS BOS We believe that any treaty regarding the sale of munitions helps move the international community closer to our world-leading standards. EOS BOS That said, the legitimate civilian use of firearms for sporting, hunting and collecting purposes should not be the target of the arms trade treaty. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, documents reveal that under the Conservatives, Canada has been reduced by the PMO to playing a low-key, minimal role at the arms trade treaty negotiations. EOS BOS This is a far cry from the leadership Canada took in the international effort to ban the use of landmines. EOS BOS If the Conservatives claim to stand up for victims, why are they working to undermine international efforts to crack down on the illicit arms trade in places like Syria and Mali? EOS BOS Why will they not stand up for victims of armed conflict? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, this government has an excellent record of working hard to ensure that the arms treaty is moving forward and that we work to ensure that there is legitimate civilian use of firearms for sporting, hunting and collecting purposes and not for civilian unrest. We will continue to work with others to determine how to move forward. EOS BOS On the ATT, Canada continues to support the arms treaty. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a funny way of actually supporting the negotiations when first the Conservatives instruct our diplomats to drag their feet on the treaty. EOS BOS Then they appoint Steve Torino to be the only civil society representative on Canada's delegation. EOS BOS This is the president of the Shooting Sports Association. EOS BOS This is the same person who recommended removing restrictions on hand guns and assault rifles in Canada. EOS BOS Why is the Conservative government ignoring Canadian values and sabotaging vital arms treaty negotiations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as has always been the case for international meetings, the composition of Canadian delegations for this type of international gathering is the minister's prerogative and responsibility. EOS BOS Our position on this treaty has not changed. EOS BOS Canada supports efforts to establish international standards for arms transfers in order to help prevent illicit transfers that fuel conflict and encourage terrorism or organized crime. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, clearly they do not understand that this treaty is about saving lives in places like Syria and Africa. EOS BOS Now, on the eve of this treaty and the negotiations, we learn that the government is actually trying to illegally export arms to Latin America, if one can believe it. EOS BOS We should be working with our international partners to cut the flow of small arms. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives allowing gun lobbyists to represent Canada in global arms negotiations? EOS BOS Remember, these are the lobbyists that even the Prime Minister finds too extreme. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said, Canada continues to support the arms treaty, but let me tell my hon. EOS BOS colleague this: support provided to partner countries through the anti-crime capacity-building program directly improves security in our hemisphere, especially by combatting transnational crime and its work to bring guns to Canada. EOS BOS We will continue working with the parties responsible and ensure that our government is committed to reducing crime and improving security around the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservative financial incompetence has ballooned Canada's national debt to more than $600 billion, but it is Canadians who are being punished. EOS BOS Nowhere is this more evident than in first nations education. EOS BOS Despite the insulting assertion of the minister, the chiefs know that funding for each student attending reserve schools is less than half of that for students off reserve. EOS BOS They want action for their youth, who have the lowest educational outcomes in this country. EOS BOS Why is the minister making first nation students pay the price for the government's financial incompetence? EOS BOS When will he close the gap? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, every year we invest in education for over 117,000 students on reserve. EOS BOS Recently I announced additional measures, such as early literacy programming to further education outcomes. EOS BOS I also made announcements in regard to new school infrastructure. EOS BOS We have already completed 263 school projects, including 33 new schools. EOS BOS We are continuing to take concrete steps to improve educational outcomes for first nation students. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2009, the Prime Minister made a formal commitment to significantly reduce greenhouse gases by 2020.Yesterday, the Minister of the Environment said that we would completely miss that target unless we regulate the oil and gas industries. EOS BOS The Prime Minister was in favour of regulations for eight years, and now he has no plans to regulate the industry. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell Canadians that the Conservatives never planned on meeting that target in 2020? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what that member said is ridiculous. EOS BOS To be clear, the Prime Minister said that Canada would not take unilateral action to regulate the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS We have been very clear that this is a North American issue that needs a North American solution. EOS BOS We have always said that we would like to work collaboratively with the Obama administration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas sector. EOS BOS We are going to do this without a job-killing carbon tax like the New Democrats and Liberals want to put in. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the OECD reaffirmed that Canada has a sound fiscal footing under the leadership of our Prime Minister. EOS BOS Our economy is envied around the world, thanks to our Conservative government's low-tax plan, and over 1.2 million net new jobs have been created. EOS BOS However, the global economy remains fragile, and the constituents of my riding of Elmwood— EOS BOS Transcona know that we must stay the course with our low-tax plan for jobs and growth. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Finance please update this House on what the world is saying about Canada's economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the International Monetary Fund's mission to Canada applauded our Conservative government for the progress we have made in eliminating deficits and for our actions to reduce taxes for hard-working Canadian families. EOS BOS The IMF also said that our measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of the housing market were effective. EOS BOS The report is further evidence that our economic action plan is doing very well. EOS BOS Canadians can be proud. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government is focused on the economy, and we are getting results, with over 820,000 net new jobs created since July 2009. EOS BOS We are getting those results through low taxes, cutting taxes over 140 times and lowering the tax bill for Canadian families by over $3,100 a year. EOS BOS We are also leaving more money in the hands of entrepreneurs to grow and create more jobs. EOS BOS Today, PricewaterhouseCoopers released a new report confirming we are on the right track. EOS BOS Could the Minister of State for Finance tell the House what the report had to say? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Chatham-Kent— EOS BOS Essex for his question. EOS BOS That is accurate. EOS BOS PricewaterhouseCoopers today confirmed that, due to our government's actions, Canada has one of the best tax systems to help businesses create jobs. EOS BOS In fact, we have moved up three spots. EOS BOS We now rank in the top 10, earning high praise for low taxes and less red tape. EOS BOS Let me quote from that report. EOS BOS It states that Canada has “attractive tax regimes, which impact all companies—in particular small-medium sized domestic companies”. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are 350,000 more unemployed workers. EOS BOS Canadian families deserve better than that; that is for sure. EOS BOS The Conservatives do not want to have any public debate on the trade agreement with China. EOS BOS They are refusing to hold any public consultation on the nationalization of our natural resources by a Chinese state-owned company, and they are unable to develop clear criteria. EOS BOS A serious government would consult experts, investors, and above all, the public. EOS BOS There are now seven days left. EOS BOS When will the new rules be published and when will this government finally act responsibly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians can count on a government that has a responsible approach EOS BOS . We are open to foreign investment as long as it provides a net benefit to Canada. EOS BOS On the other side of the House, the NDP has a radical and irresponsible anti-investment and anti-trade agenda. EOS BOS Each transaction that is proposed in Canada is assessed on its merit based on what will bring the greatest benefit to Canadians and what will be in their best interests. EOS BOS This is the approach that we are going to continue to take. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under a responsible NDP government, we will have clear criteria. EOS BOS We will consult Canadians because Canadians deserve better than what they are getting from the government. EOS BOS Incompetence, thy name is Conservative. EOS BOS We are seven days away from a final deadline on Nexen and there is still no criteria, no transparency and Canadians have been completely shut out. EOS BOS Billions are at stake and so is control of Canada's natural resources. EOS BOS Industry has no clue what is going on. EOS BOS Wall Street traders are confused. EOS BOS Share prices are falling fast. EOS BOS Therefore, where is the new criteria EOS BOS ? When will the government do its work? When will it start to act responsibly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, clearly the criteria proposed by the NDP members is no investment at all, no trade at all, no progress at all in terms of the economy. EOS BOS They propose a carbon tax of $21.5 billion on the shoulders of Canadians. EOS BOS It would be a job-killing tax. EOS BOS They want to tax everything. EOS BOS They want to raise taxes everywhere. EOS BOS That is not responsible. EOS BOS We welcome foreign investment that provides net benefit for Canada. EOS BOS Each transaction is reviewed under its own merit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Bill C-51 is so flawed that even the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe found it necessary to publish a legal study demonstrating that this bill violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. EOS BOS Moreover, we learned yesterday that Canadian telecommunications service providers have already been sharing vast quantities of personal information with the authorities with no oversight. EOS BOS That is simply unacceptable. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives finally listen to reason and scrap their dangerous bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us remember that on October 20 and 22, right here in this country, we were victims of terrorist acts. EOS BOS That is a reality that the New Democrats are refusing to see or accept. EOS BOS That is why we are implementing responsible measures and working with our partners in France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia to combat the terrorist threat. EOS BOS When will the New Democrats join us and find ways to fight terrorism? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. EOS BOS The same government that is forcing successful law enforcement programs like Project Condor to shut down, and the same government that is taking resources away from financial and organized crime investigations, is refusing to protect Canadians' personal information from unprecedented online surveillance. EOS BOS Instead, it is pushing Bill C-51, a bill so flawed that our allies in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe think that it violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. EOS BOS When will the minister stop pushing this bad bill and focus on real measures to keep Canadians safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the real question is when will the NDP get serious about the terrorist threat that Canada is facing, along with our allies, such as Great Britain, France, New Zealand, Australia, and our fellow Americans?That is why we put measures in place, welcomed as of Monday by Commissioner Paulson, that will make it easier for the police to track terrorists and keep Canadians safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's universal child care benefits and family tax cut benefits 100% of Canadian families with children. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Employment and Social Development please inform the House on how much money families are saving? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, they are not only saving through the family tax cut and benefits but also through the tax-free savings account. EOS BOS We have a low-tax plan for retirement savings. EOS BOS Today the Liberal leader announced that he would bring in a high-tax plan. EOS BOS He would hit workers and small businesses with a massive premium hike that would force small businesses to lay off thousands of Canadians. EOS BOS This policy would send shockwaves through our economy. EOS BOS It is a major risk. EOS BOS It demonstrates once again that this Liberal leader is just not ready for the job. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning the Minister of State for Science and Technology announced our government's investment in a number of new technologies, including one developed by Trillium Therapeutics that will treat a chronic bladder disease. EOS BOS While improving the lives of millions of women in North America, this project is also forecasted to create more than 100 jobs for engineers, manufacturing workers, researchers and clinicians. EOS BOS Could the Minister of State for Science and Technology give the House an update on how our government is leading the way on science and technology? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know that the member is very passionate about science and technology, as are our Prime Minister and this government. We have invested more in science and technology than any government in the history of this country. EOS BOS The reason we are doing that is to create high quality jobs, to improve and grow our economy and to improve the quality of life for Canadians. EOS BOS We will continue to invest in important areas in science and technology so that Canada can continue to lead the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, terrorism and threats of radical violence are threats to western nations around the world and Canada is no exception. EOS BOS That is why we have taken strong action, such as establishing Canada's first counterterrorism strategy and following through on recommendations from Justice John Major with the Air India action plan. EOS BOS One important part of that was ensuring that there was a base of theoretical knowledge of why people participated in terrorism and how terrorism worked. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please update the House on how our government is doing that through the Kanishka project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last year our government announced the Kanishka project, which will invest in research on the issue surrounding terrorism. EOS BOS The Kanishka project is named after the Air India flight 182 plane that was bombed on June 23, 1985. EOS BOS Our government has committed a total of $10 million over five years to the project as a way to honour the memory of the victims. EOS BOS Yesterday I was proud to announce the first round of projects funded under the program. EOS BOS I look forward to seeing Canada become a world leader on research on the issue surrounding terrorism. EOS BOS I want to thank the member for his involvement in this project. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at a time when astronaut Chris Hadfield is inspiring all Canadians as he serves on the international space station, the Conservatives are abandoning the 700 employees of the Canadian Space Agency. EOS BOS The agency is in financial difficulty, but the Conservatives could not care less. EOS BOS The president resigned last week, frustrated that his projects were going nowhere. EOS BOS What will the Conservatives do to keep the agency's employees and their expertise in Canada? EOS BOS Will they leave Commander Hadfield up in the air? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. EOS BOS If my colleague paid more attention to this file, she would know that, a few weeks ago, we announced Canada's participation in the very important and cutting-edge RADARSAT Constellation mission. EOS BOS We are world leaders in satellite technology. EOS BOS We are very proud of Chris Hadfield, the first Canadian astronaut to command the international space station. EOS BOS By the way, Canada's participation in the international space station program until 2020 was announced in the 2012 economic action plan. EOS BOS Thanks to our plan, we have commanders like Chris Hadfield, whom we are very proud of. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week we tabled a motion asking the government to work collaboratively with Parliament to contain Ebola at source. EOS BOS In that spirit of co-operation, we even amended our original motion to accommodate the government's concerns. EOS BOS Since then, there have been 400 new Ebola deaths and spread to another African country. EOS BOS Effective action in Africa is even more critical now and so is a national Ebola plan for Canada. EOS BOS It is time to put aside political partisanship and end these deaths. EOS BOS Will the minister vote for our motion? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can reassure the member that I have now met with my provincial counterparts three times, most recently yesterday, to discuss their preparedness. EOS BOS In terms of the motion, the member knows, as we email each other, that I am available every day in the House of Commons. EOS BOS I am willing to come to committee to answer questions. EOS BOS Dr. Taylor, our Chief Public Health Officer, has made himself available for briefings for any MP and he briefed all MPs before the House rose a couple of weeks ago. EOS BOS We will continue to make ourselves fully available to all members of Parliament. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if it were up to the Conservatives, Canadians would know nothing about Luc Plamondon and André Gagnon. EOS BOS These artists, influential pillars of the Quebec cultural scene, do not exist on the Library and Archives Canada site. EOS BOS Although the Conservatives would have us believe that budget cuts have no impact, this situation is a sad reminder that this is not true. EOS BOS When I asked the minister about putting the brakes on cuts to Library and Archives Canada last week, he replied that his choices enhance access to content. EOS BOS What content? EOS BOS Content that does not exist? EOS BOS Will he stop taking us for fools and put an end to these ideological cuts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague may not believe our record when it comes to arts and culture but here is who does. EOS BOS This is what Joe Rotman, chair of the Canada Council for the Arts, said about the budget that we will be voting on this year. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS This government clearly appreciates the positive contribution the arts have to the economy and the identity of this country”.The member may not think that I am perhaps the best spokesperson for the arts but here is who does. EOS BOS Simon Brault, president of Culture Montreal, said, “Funding for the Canada Council of the Arts will remain intact and we owe a debt of gratitude to this government for listening to artists”. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the government was preparing to announce its unfair funding for the Lower Churchill project, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously reiterated its opposition to federal assistance. EOS BOS The Bloc Québécois was the only party in the House to condemn the great unfairness of Ottawa using Quebeckers' money to support projects that are counter to their economic interests and that will compete directly with Hydro-Québec, a government entity that the Quebec nation built itself. EOS BOS How can this government, with the support of the Liberals and the NDP, have such disregard for the interests of Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a loan guarantee is not an allocation of taxpayers' money; it is the use of our credit rating, which reflects the government's strong financial performance. EOS BOS Last week, during my telephone conversation with Quebec's natural resources minister, Martine Ouellet, I reminded her that the federal government is prepared to support other major regional or Canadian projects that are economically viable and that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this would normally be the end of the current session. EOS BOS As we know, the Parliament of Canada can do as it pleases. EOS BOS Last Thursday, we sat as though it were a Friday. EOS BOS Tomorrow, Friday, we will sit as though it were still Thursday. EOS BOS In fact, this could end up being the first-ever week of four Thursdays. EOS BOS The government has mastered the art of this type of transformation. EOS BOS It can turn losers into winners. EOS BOS If someone loses in an election and is not chosen to create legislation in the House, they can always be appointed to the Senate and sit as a parliamentarian. EOS BOS During question period, the Conservatives spoke about the importance of respecting the Quebec nation. EOS BOS Yet tomorrow is Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day and they still want us to sit. EOS BOS With all of these contradictions—in particular, the fact that they decided that the best way to monitor public spending is to fire those who monitor public spending and that they locked out workers and are now blaming the workers for not working—are there any more surprises like this in store for us this summer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments from the member for Outremont. EOS BOS He did speak of respect. EOS BOS I hope he will take a look at his comments, have in mind Standing Order 18, and reflect upon how his comments fit into Standing Order 18.Since today is the last scheduled sitting of the House before members return to their constituencies for the summer, my answer will be relatively brief. EOS BOS [Translation]When this bill is passed, the House will adjourn until September 19. EOS BOS [English]As for the business of the House upon our return in September, I will advise my counterparts of the government's plans closer to that time. EOS BOS In case this is the last time I am on my feet this summer, let me thank the staff of the House and the clerks at the table for their support and their usual kind assistance, in addition to the pages, who I acknowledged fully yesterday. EOS BOS Finally, I thank all hon. members for the very productive sitting we have had this month. EOS BOS A great deal has been accomplished in just about 12 sitting days. EOS BOS I hope they will all have happy and productive summers with their constituents. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Air Canada is a chronic offender when it comes to official languages. EOS BOS The public is lodging a growing number of complaints. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Official Languages has criticized Air Canada, and our courts regularly say that the carrier is violating its official language obligations, yet nothing changes. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop tolerating the behaviour of Air Canada, which has repeatedly shown that it could not care less about French and about Canadian laws? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court ruled on this issue. We respect the Supreme Court's decision and we expect Air Canada to comply with the Air Canada Public Participation Act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Internet is not a luxury but a necessity in today's world. EOS BOS While it is important to invest in infrastructure and support access to Internet service, we also need to maintain equal access to information provided to it. EOS BOS We need net neutrality. EOS BOS Just this past weekend, the member from Beauce said we needed less net neutrality and the member for Parry Sound—Muskoka said he disagreed. EOS BOS It seems the official opposition cannot take a position. EOS BOS Could the minister clearly reiterate the government's position on net neutrality in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was wondering if the leader of the official opposition could provide clarification on what its position is, because the member for Beauce, who is the official innovation critic said one thing and the member for Parry Sound—Muskoka says he disagrees with him. EOS BOS Let me be clear. EOS BOS Our government stands to support net neutrality. EOS BOS We support an open Internet. EOS BOS We support the CRTC framework for net neutrality, because we know an open Internet is critical for our economy and our democracy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has misled Canadians and closed regional offices and the Auditor General has reported that he has failed veterans, yet he stands in this place and refuses to take responsibility. EOS BOS What about veterans like Daniel Scott from Surrey, who lost his spleen and has health problems that will plague him for the rest of his life? EOS BOS The government gave Scott a one-time payment of just $41,000. EOS BOS Does the government really want to force veterans like Daniel through the courts just to get justice? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a veteran who is injured and in rehabilitation receives a minimum of $3,500 in financial benefits each month. EOS BOS Veterans who are most seriously injured can receive $8,000 or more per month in financial benefits from the Government of Canada and their military pension. EOS BOS Our government has increased the two disability awards to a new combined total of half a million dollars, tax free. EOS BOS Injured veterans now also have access to up to $75,800 toward university and college retraining. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week, the UN reported that one million people have fled the unrelenting horror in Syria, a figure increasing at the alarming rate of 6,000 refugees daily, half of them children, a humanitarian disaster compounded by three million internally displaced and the appalling number of over 70,000 dead. EOS BOS Given that the Assad regime remains willing to slaughter its own, will the government increase its humanitarian assistance, facilitate family reunification and resettlement in Canada, and join the international effort to bring Assad and Syrian war criminals before the International Criminal Court? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is very much concerned about the situation that is going on in Syria. EOS BOS We have made our position very clear that Mr. Assad must go. EOS BOS As far as the International Criminal Court is concerned, we will let the people of Syria decide what Mr. Assad's future is, but let us be very clear: Mr. Assad must go, to bring peace back to Syria. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Albertans are very concerned about the NDP's position regarding the oil sands. EOS BOS The NDP appears all too willing to abandon the interests of construction workers and oil sands workers. EOS BOS For example, both the former NDP environment critic, an Albertan, and the current leadership contender, Mr. Brian Topp, have called for a moratorium on oil sands development. EOS BOS Meanwhile, the NDP natural resources and environment critics have actually taken it up a notch and are telling our international trading partners not to trade with Canada. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Natural Resources give this House an update on the latest academic research on the viability of the oil sands? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a study published by Dr. Weaver in Nature magazine concluded that the oil sands will raise temperatures by only .03 of one degree Centigrade in 60 years. EOS BOS For that, the NDP is prepared to sacrifice $3.3 trillion in economic activity, over 700,000 jobs a year, and billions of dollars in social programs. EOS BOS The NDP's opposition to the oil sands is increasingly ideological and unbalanced. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Toronto police have laid the first charge under the government's cyberbullying legislation. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Justice update the House on the action our government is taking in this area? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for Mississauga South for her interest and her hard work on behalf of her constituents and also commend the Toronto police for their outstanding efforts. EOS BOS We know that bullying and cyberbullying have a very far-reaching and corrosive impact on Canadians, particularly our youth. EOS BOS Our government took concrete action by passing the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act to further protect our most vulnerable. EOS BOS It prohibits the non-consensual distribution of intimate images in Canada in our Criminal Code. EOS BOS Our government will continue to protect law-abiding Canadians and ensure that those who commit these horrendous crimes will be held accountable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a young MP once asked about the Liberals' infamous appointment of Privacy Commissioner George Radwanski. EOS BOS The question was:...will the government at least...commit to a full parliamentary review for all appointees?Who was that? EOS BOS It was the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Now we have had barely 45 minutes of committee questions before the Liberals and Conservatives stood together and wilfully ignored the concerns of experts and advocates. EOS BOS Was that 45 minutes really the full parliamentary review the Prime Minister once promised? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Privacy Commissioner is a person with over 30 years' experience in legal and privacy matters. EOS BOS He comes from a field of highly qualified candidates, and he was the best candidate. EOS BOS It will be interesting to see, as question period progresses, whether NDP members will repeat what they did yesterday when they had one round of questions decrying the selection of the Privacy Commissioner and another round of questions asking why we did not listen to the Privacy Commissioner. EOS BOS I would like to see what sort of mail-outs they are going to have on that one. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a big difference between the Daniel Therrien who seems to have developed a sudden passion for human rights and the one who defended security certificates, deporting people to countries that practise torture and sharing information with the NSA.This is another example of the Prime Minister's amateur approach. EOS BOS Why have the Conservatives, old Reformers, lost all respect for individual freedoms? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, Mr. Therrien is the best candidate for this position. EOS BOS Yesterday, the NDP said that the Privacy Commissioner is not the best candidate, and then they turned around and said that we have to listen to the commissioner. EOS BOS That is a hypocritical position. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are feeling the effects of employment insurance reform at home. EOS BOS [English]For over 30 years, Robert Devaney, from my riding, has been a teacher, for at least 12 of those years, a supply teacher. EOS BOS Between placements he sometimes has to rely on EI, a program he has paid into for decades. EOS BOS The Conservatives' new rules mean he is no longer eligible. EOS BOS He may even have to turn to social assistance. EOS BOS Is this the kind of common sense they are talking about?Why are Conservatives making life harder for our teachers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, employment insurance will be available for those who need it in the circumstances they find themselves when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own. EOS BOS With respect to the program, we are making some common sense changes that will help people find jobs and connect with jobs in their communities. EOS BOS It is very important to be reminded that EI will be there for people when they do need it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, aboriginal people across the country are starving. EOS BOS The report of the UN special rapporteur on the right to food states that Inuit are facing severe food insecurity. EOS BOS The report recommends a food strategy that defines the responsibilities of every level of government. EOS BOS Will the government be part of the solution instead of the problem when it comes to safe, affordable nutrition for Inuit living in Canada's north? EOS BOS Will it put forward a Canadian food strategy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is making huge investments to the nutrition north program for Canada's north. EOS BOS Our government increased the program to $60 million, which that party did not support. EOS BOS I met with the UN special rapporteur last May and was very surprised how ill-informed the rapporteur was on the government's investment. EOS BOS At the same time, he failed to meet with the people in the north in terms of the real opportunities and the challenges faced by aboriginal people around food security. EOS BOS We will not be studied from afar and we will not accept the recommendations from a UN rapporteur that fails to meet with our people. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the government did not get the hint already, today Ottawa city council formally voted to ask the Conservatives to move the memorial for victims of Communism back to its original site. EOS BOS A fundamental cornerstone of our democracy is consultation, and consultation requires listening. EOS BOS Will the minister do our democracy the honour of actually listening and respecting elected representatives? EOS BOS In other words, will Conservatives change the location of the memorial back to its original site? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our federal government provided federal land for a national monument that will in fact commemorate over 100 million innocent lives lost under Communist regimes EOS BOS . We will be very proud to put that monument in a prominent location to do just what we promised to do. EOS BOS Allow me to correct some of the misinformation spread by some of the members of the opposition. EOS BOS It will not be built in front of the Supreme Court. EOS BOS It will be down the street on a completely separate plot of land. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for over 25 years, aboriginal women living on reserves have been without the legal protections that are available to all other Canadians. EOS BOS In cases of family violence, they are kicked out of their homes with no place to go. EOS BOS First nations women, international organizations and even the Manitoba NDP agree that this must change. EOS BOS As today is International Women's Day, would the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development please update the House on what our government is doing to protect aboriginal women living on reserves? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has introduced matrimonial property rights legislation to protect thousands of aboriginal women living on reserves across Canada. EOS BOS In situations of family violence, the bill would allow judges to enforce emergency protection orders and remove a violent partner. EOS BOS Tragically, the NDP and Liberals continue to oppose this legislation. EOS BOS The bill is long overdue. EOS BOS We continue to stand up for aboriginal women so they can have the same rights and protections as all Canadian women across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at last week's G7 meeting in Japan, the Prime Minister showed real indifference to Prime Minister Abe's push to seek early ratification of the TPP. EOS BOS The Prime Minister, however, seems much more inclined to push for an early deal with China. EOS BOS While that is a very important market for us, the Prime Minister has also said, “ EOS BOS It’s important that people know that when they sign a deal with Canada, a change of government isn’t going to lead to the contract being ripped up”. EOS BOS Why will the Prime Minister not prioritize ratifying the TPP before holding trade talks with China? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government clearly supports free trade as a way to create growth and create good jobs for the middle class. EOS BOS Witness our success with getting the CETA back on track after it had fallen completely off the rails. EOS BOS When it comes to the TPP, none of the other 12 countries have ratified the TPP, and that includes Japan. EOS BOS We have promised to consult Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and that is precisely what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the duplicity of the government knows no bounds. EOS BOS While its ministers spend like royalty it looks for so-called efficiencies by surreptitiously cutting programs to the most sick and vulnerable. Suicides in the Canadian Forces have almost doubled. EOS BOS The current government cut veteran suicide prevention programs and the specialists who treat post-traumatic stress disorder. EOS BOS PTSD causes a lifetime of mental pain and suffering. EOS BOS Can the Minister of National Defence justify these callous cuts as easily as he defends his bloated perks? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, virtually all of what the member has just said is false. EOS BOS We are not reducing, but are in fact increasing, the support for the Canadian Forces members, veterans and their families, as we have done consistently since taking office. EOS BOS We are working toward doubling the number of mental health professionals available to members. EOS BOS We have opened joint personnel support units across the country. EOS BOS We continue to work with the civilian mental health care workers in associations across the country to see that they are able to help our reservists as well as our regular force members. EOS BOS We are very proud of what we have done. EOS BOS We will continue to make those investments. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, more topics have been discussed and there has been more heated debate with the provinces in the one year that this government has been in office than there were in 10 years under the previous government. EOS BOS Today, ministers from Quebec are asking the government to get its ducks in a row and start doing its job on the softwood lumber issue. EOS BOS Will the government be able to work with the provinces as promised? EOS BOS More importantly, will it be able to sign a softwood lumber deal for our 300,000 forestry workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since taking office, we, on this side of the House, have met with the provincial governments on numerous occasions to talk about many different issues. EOS BOS We strengthened the Canada pension plan and we created a pan-Canadian framework on climate change. EOS BOS We signed landmark agreements with the provinces and we are working closely with them on the softwood lumber issue in order to resolve this situation with the Americans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while Canadians are struggling to make ends meet, the Liberals are inventing new ways to waste taxpayer money. EOS BOS Canadians were astounded when the Minister of Infrastructure spent $835,000 redoing his offices, but they were flabbergasted that the former Minister of Status of Women spent $1.1 million to furnish a new office. EOS BOS Having visited her previous office, which was perfectly adequate, I want to know why hard-earned taxpayer dollars were wasted on this unnecessary extravagance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to serve as the Minister of Status of Women with a government that has put gender equality at the heart of its priorities, and with a Prime Minister who is a feminist in words and in actions. EOS BOS Previous to the Prime Minister's leadership, there was no full ministry of status of women. EOS BOS The staff needed a place to work. EOS BOS I am so proud that the public service as well as the ministerial team are on the same floor. EOS BOS This was a responsible use of dollars, and we will continue to deliver on behalf of all Canadians. EOS
BOS I hope the new minister does not want to redecorate, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS We could buy four condos in Ottawa for the same price the minster spent furnishing her new office. EOS BOS While seniors cannot pay their hydro bills and veterans go homeless, the Liberals keep wasting Canadian money. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister put a stop to this entitled, ridiculous, lavish spending and start focusing on the needs of real Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, after 10 years of neglect by the previous government, we are finally making progress to ensure that people of all genders have equal opportunity to thrive. EOS BOS The decision to have both ministerial staff and the public service on the same level was important. EOS BOS It is important to reduce silos across all sectors, including our own. EOS BOS We will continue to deliver positive results on behalf of all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is interesting the Prime Minister will not tell Canadians how much his carbon tax will cost, especially considering it is his signature economic and environmental policy. EOS BOS Why hide it? EOS BOS He will not reveal the cost to families, seniors, and workers. EOS BOS In fact, this is now becoming widely known as the carbon tax cover-up. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS Will he come clean and let Canadians know just how much the carbon tax will cost them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the party opposite, we understand that there is a real cost to not acting on climate change. EOS BOS We know that it costs—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, order. I know members are excited to hear the answer, but we need to hear it. EOS BOS Settle down. EOS BOS Stay calm. EOS BOS We are going to be away from here soon for a few days, working hard in our constituencies. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Environment and Climate Change has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the cost to Canadians through insurance claims from climate change incidents, like floods, like forest fires, is more than $1 billion. EOS BOS That number is going to continue to rise. EOS BOS That is why we are taking serious action. EOS BOS We are putting a price on pollution, we are going to grow our economy, and we are going to invest in good jobs, because it is the right thing to do and it makes business sense. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister spends as much time explaining his rash decisions to the Canadian public and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner as a disobedient child spends in time out thinking about what he has done. EOS BOS It is high time that the Prime Minister demonstrate some consistency and integrity and give the House some clear answers. EOS BOS How many times has the Prime Minister met with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to discuss his loose ethics? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you know, I am always pleased to work with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to answer any questions she may have. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a very simple question, but mainly it is a question of trust. EOS BOS What Canadians are hearing is that there are laws that apply to them but that do not apply to the Prime Minister. EOS BOS I will repeat my question. EOS BOS How many times has the Prime Minister met with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have always said, I am very pleased to meet with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and work with her to answer any questions she may have on this subject or any other. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a moment ago, the Prime Minister arrogantly insulted our opposition leader and said she was confused. EOS BOS Let me say that I think this is actually full confusion right now with the Prime Minister. EOS BOS I will repeat the question in English, because the question is not if he is happy or satisfied or feeling good about meeting the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS Has the Prime Minister met with the Ethics Commissioner, and if so, how many times? EOS BOS It is very, very simple. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to work with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to answer any questions she may have. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect of the Prime Minister and that is exactly what I am doing. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Banff—Airdrie and others will come to order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS opposition House leader has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what Canadians expect is that their Prime Minister would give a clear answer to a clear and a simple question. EOS BOS If he has something to hide, then Canadians want to know that as well. EOS BOS I would suggest, if he wants to send Canadians the message that he has nothing to hide, that he answer the question. EOS BOS How many times has the Prime Minister met with the Ethics Commissioner? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to work with and answer the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner's questions. EOS BOS It is extremely important that we work—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS Most members in all parties can sit through question period without reacting to what they hear, and I think we should have confidence in the ability of Canadians to judge the quality of questions and answers. EOS BOS I am sure members have confidence in Canadians to be able to do that, and they do not need the help of people heckling. EOS BOS The right hon. EOS BOS Prime Minister has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians expect the Prime Minister to work with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner any time she has questions, and that is exactly what I have been doing. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister keeps saying he is happy to meet with the Ethics Commissioner and answer any questions she might have, but he is really playing a game of political survivor by outwitting, outplaying, and outlasting the Ethics Commissioner over his vacation to billionaire island. EOS BOS It has been asked four times already. I do not even know why I am trying, to be frank, but I will repeat the simple question. EOS BOS How many times has the Prime Minister met with the Ethics Commissioner? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am happy, as should be any member of this House, to work with the Ethics Commissioner and answer any questions that she may have. I think that is important. EOS </s> BOS What a charade, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS The Prime Minister said he would stand up every Wednesday and answer every question that is being asked of every member on this side of the House, and he fails to do it. EOS BOS He has been asked five times today about the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS For the sake of my colleagues, I will ask it again. EOS BOS How many times, how many times, how many times, how many times, how many times, and how many times has he met with the Ethics Commissioner? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians expect clarity and they expect consistency, and when asked the same question, I will give the same answer. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect. EOS BOS I will work with and answer the questions that the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner may have. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister truly believes in the importance of question period, if he sincerely believes in transparency and accountability, he is going to have to find it somewhere inside himself to answer this very basic question, because it only concerns him and he knows the answer. EOS BOS He is being investigated by the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS How many times has the Prime Minister communicated with the Ethics Commissioner? EOS BOS Answer the question. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Huron— EOS BOS Bruce will come to order. EOS BOS Order. EOS BOS The right hon. Prime Minister. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when asked the same question, I will give the same answer. EOS BOS I am happy to work with the Ethics Commissioner on any questions she may have. EOS BOS One of the things that I like about prime minister's question period is I get to take questions from any MP across the way who has a question, not just the party leaders. EOS BOS I think it is important for all members in this House to be able to ask direct questions of the Prime Minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this fall the minister said inaction on greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a “cataclysmic day”. EOS BOS Despite this understanding, all the government has done on climate change is slash programs and take Canada backwards. EOS BOS Now we learn that the government is signalling its withdrawal from its international climate obligations. EOS BOS If the minister accepts that climate change is real, as he claims, and the government promises accountability and transparency, why is it planning to withdraw after the Durban conference? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us talk about something that is cataclysmic: signing on to an international accord with no plans to implement it. EOS BOS That is what a Liberal government would do. EOS BOS Let us talk about its record. EOS BOS Under the Liberal government, Canada's carbon dioxide emissions rose between 1997 and 2005. EOS BOS We have a plan, an action plan and it is working. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, to distract us from the minister's incompetence and to counter its miserable record on the environment, this government has announced with gusto a paltry $120 million annually to fight climate change in Canada. EOS BOS In the past three years, Quebec alone has invested almost twice that amount, $200 million per year. EOS BOS Do the Conservatives really believe that such a pittance will make us forget the six years of inaction, obstruction, ignorance and bad faith? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would encourage the colleague opposite to actually read the budget before voting against it. EOS BOS What is included in the budget is $252 million to support regulatory activities to address climate change and air quality. EOS BOS I could go through the list of the hundreds of millions of dollars that we have prudently invested to take care of Canada's environment, a record of which we are proud. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we want to ensure we have clarity and transparency on the mission. EOS BOS On another topic, there is urgent need for more help on Ebola. EOS BOS We note that the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, is visiting West Africa and has underlined the urgent need for increased aid and more medical workers to help stop new infections. EOS BOS Will the minister be offering Mr. Kerry a scaled up Canadian commitment in response to this global health crisis? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there were requests about Canada's participation to help combat this terrible disease. EOS BOS As I said, as of no later than Friday, the disbursement from Canada were $57 million. EOS BOS That brings our contribution to the second largest amount of all contributors in combatting Ebola. EOS BOS We will ensure that we keep monitoring the situation very closely. EOS BOS As I said, we have helped in prevention and education with UNICEF, 900,000 people so far. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, is calling on the international community to do more to combat the Ebola crisis. EOS BOS West Africa desperately needs more personnel and basic medical equipment. EOS BOS An American ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, is calling on everyone to urgently provide beds and medical personnel. EOS BOS Will the government offer any such assistance to the U.S. Secretary of State? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are in constant contact with our allies, and in particular with the United States. EOS BOS As I said in the House just last Friday, Canada has already contributed $57 million, which makes us the second-largest donor in the fight against the Ebola crisis. EOS BOS We have been there since April 2014. EOS BOS We have already provided equipment and logistical assistance to the World Health Organization. EOS BOS We continue to assess all opportunities. EOS BOS For example, with UNICEF, we were able to help educate 900,000 people on preventive measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have fought and voted against every advancement of gay rights in Canada, from pension benefits to marriage to transgender rights, and yet, yesterday, the Conservatives came out in support of the “ EOS BOS It Gets Better” gay youth campaign. EOS BOS If the Conservatives are now serious about helping gay youth, will they recognize the support that pride festivals provide to struggling young gays? EOS BOS Will the Conservatives restore the funding that they themselves cut for these important pride festivals across Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate the answer we gave earlier. EOS BOS This government has provided extraordinary amounts of funding in the arts and culture sector across this country, and we are very proud to do so. EOS BOS In my own riding and in ridings across this country, festivals are being supported. EOS BOS We get a lot of applications for a lot of different things. EOS BOS We support a lot of different cultural festivals in communities across Canada. EOS BOS We look at all of those applications on their merit and we support the ones that Canadians ask us to support and the ones that meet the criteria of the programs that we establish. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport's position on the Champlain Bridge issue simply does not cut it. EOS BOS From the beginning, Ottawa has refused to co-operate with the Government of Quebec regarding what form of public transit will be included. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport is shifting the blame onto Quebec, accusing it of not saying what mode of transportation it prefers. EOS BOS How can Quebec settle on a transportation mode when Ottawa refuses to say whether the bridge will be adapted to it? EOS BOS Quebec is not about to lay down tracks, only to stop at the bridge and wait for the federal government to decide what it wants to do with the bridge. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities stop working in a vacuum and confirm that the new bridge will include whatever sort of public transit infrastructure the Government of Quebec wants? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are going to build a bridge. EOS BOS At the same time, we are open to some form of public transit. EOS BOS The Government of Quebec must indicate the kind of public transit it wants so that we can work to that end. EOS BOS The federal government is providing Quebec with a generous envelope for infrastructure. EOS BOS The Government of Quebec can give priority to whatever projects it wants. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this past Monday, many Canadians and those in my riding of London West took part in Victoria Day celebrations. EOS BOS It is an annual occasion that marks the strong historical ties between Canada and the United Kingdom. EOS BOS The relationship between our two countries is deeply rooted in our common history, our shared values, our tradition of parliamentary democracy, and our strong family and people-to-people ties. EOS BOS As chair of the Canada-U.K. Parliamentary Group, I would like to ask the Minister of Canadian Heritage to comment on the Canada-U.K. relationship and ways in which it might be strengthened in the near future. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canada-U.K. relationship is broad and deep and, of course, has survived through profound international change. EOS BOS In recent years, our relationship has grown even stronger with the celebration of Her Majesty's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, as well as successful visits of the Prince of Wales as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. EOS BOS On June 13 of this year, for the first time since Prime Minister Mackenzie King had the privilege in 1942, our Prime Minister will be speaking to both Houses of the U.K. Parliament to advance Canada's interests in Europe and work together with the U.K. on our prosperity and security together. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government cannot seem to get its act together on labour market information. EOS BOS It gets the job vacancy numbers from Kijiji. EOS BOS It does not count aboriginal Canadians in the unemployment rate. EOS BOS It has gutted Statistics Canada. EOS BOS Now even the TD Bank has given up on the government and has created its own indicator. EOS BOS The new TD LMI shows that the Canadian labour market has been very weak over the past two years. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop playing with numbers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government recognizes the need for better labour market information. EOS BOS We are addressing that. EOS BOS We have launched two comprehensive new surveys for labour market information, a quarterly job vacancy survey and an annual national wage report. EOS BOS We are listening to the experts. EOS BOS We are ensuring that we have accurate labour market information. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the temporary foreign worker program train wreck is due in part to the lack of reliable data. EOS BOS In fact, TD Bank no longer trusts the government's labour market information. EOS BOS After having to develop its own methodology, it discovered that Canada's labour market has been ailing for two years, contrary to what the Conservatives claim. EOS BOS Instead of messing with the numbers and pretending that the labour market is not in big trouble, will the Conservatives tackle unemployment with a real job creation plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, we are not just looking but moving forward on ways to improve our labour market information. EOS BOS There are other things we are doing. EOS BOS We have made strong reforms to our temporary foreign worker program so we can ensure Canadians have first crack at the jobs that are available. EOS BOS We have also introduced the Canada job grant so employers are linked directly with skills training for jobs that are available. EOS BOS We recognize there are gaps in certain regions in the country in regard to labour skills and labour needs. EOS BOS We are working on the whole sector in terms of labour market information and addressing those labour market needs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to providing the right conditions so that industry and business can succeed and compete in the global economy. EOS BOS Canada benefits from large reserves of natural gas but has limited capacity to supply it to emerging international and domestic markets, where demand is growing. EOS BOS That is why our government recently announced the plan to support jobs and growth in the emerging liquified natural gas, or LNG, industry in British Columbia. EOS BOS Could the hard-working Minister of Industry please update the House on what our government is doing to attract business investment in British Columbia? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Kelowna for this very important question. EOS BOS Equally, I would like to thank the B.C. caucus chair, our friend from Prince George—Peace River, for being a persistent advocate on the importance of standing up for the LNG industry in our home province of British Columbia. EOS BOS British Columbia is home to 2.9 million cubic feet of natural gas, and there are currently 19 LNG projects in British Columbia. EOS BOS Ten of them have received export permits from the National Energy Board, and, as I have said, if five of them were to move forward, it would create over 100,000 full-time, well-paying jobs in the province of British Columbia. EOS BOS However, for British Columbia and Canada to move forward to get our products to world markets and get world prices, we have to make sure that we are competitive. EOS BOS That is why our Prime Minister was in British Columbia, working with the Premier of British Columbia and working as well in co-operation with all of the coastal first nations and with first nations across British Columbia on these key projects to make sure we all benefit from them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, trading is crucial to our Canadian agricultural sectors. EOS BOS We are the fifth largest agricultural exporter in the world, and our agricultural and agrifood industries employ 2.2 million Canadians. EOS BOS In Manitoba, most of those producers are SMEs. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food tell us what steps he is taking to promote our agrifood SMEs and expand Canada's agricultural trade around the world? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be leading an upcoming trade mission to Vietnam and India as part of our government's effort to strengthen and expand trade in the Asia-Pacific region. EOS BOS I look forward to promoting world-class Canadian products, including Canadian pulses, in India. EOS BOS Our government has already produced great results for Canadian farmers, and we will continue to expand our agricultural exports, create jobs and growth for Canadian farmers, and help more people join the middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as we know, flooding has devastated communities in several Canadian regions, including my riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles. EOS BOS I would like to thank all the volunteers and first responders who have offered to help during these past few days in order to ensure the safety of my constituents and the community. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister inform the House of the most recent action taken by the government in response to this emergency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles for her work in the House and the assistance she has provided to the people in her community. EOS BOS Our thoughts are with all Canadians affected by the flooding and we thank the first responders and volunteers. EOS BOS Approximately 1,730 members of the armed forces have been deployed in Quebec and hundreds of thousands of sandbags have been distributed in Ontario. EOS BOS In addition to our support on the ground, we are pleased to announce that $1 million will be donated to the Canadian Red Cross to provide immediate assistance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk about women as victims within aboriginal societies, but what about aboriginal women in the criminal justice system?Will the government have to build more prisons to house the ever-increasing number of aboriginal women? EOS BOS The reconciliation meetings made it clear that there is a lack of services and support for aboriginal women who are incarcerated. EOS BOS Does the government have plans for rehabilitation programs for aboriginal women in prison? EOS </s> BOS Now the Liberals are calling for us to build new prisons, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS I do not know if they know what they want. EOS BOS The fact is that our prison systems are working to help aboriginal women. EOS BOS We are a leader. EOS BOS Correctional Service of Canada is a leader in terms of the services we are providing for aboriginal women who are serving sentences. EOS BOS We need to look at the whole issue of why women are getting involved and becoming criminals. EOS BOS I think they are in a vulnerable stage. EOS BOS When the opposition is not supporting Bill S-2, which empowers women on reserve, it is not helping aboriginal women. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians would be shocked to learn that we currently pay more in interest on Canada's debt than we do on national defence. EOS BOS Canadians have every right to be worried. EOS BOS The finance department tabled a report just before Christmas that says that without major changes, Canada may not balance its budget until 2050 or 2051, but the Liberals will not allow parliamentarians to study this report. EOS BOS Why the cover-up? EOS BOS Is it because the minister questions the work of his own department, or does he not want Canadians to know the truth about their reckless spending path? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the report in question showed that Canada's economy is sustainable over the long term. EOS BOS What it did not do is examine the impacts of the measures that we are taking to improve Canada's economy. EOS BOS It did not show the impact of the measures we have taken to reduce taxes on middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS It did not show the impact of the investments we have made in infrastructure and will continue to make so that we can grow our economy. EOS BOS It did not show the impact that a newly more innovative Canada, through skills development and innovation funding, will make on our economy. EOS BOS Over the long term, our economy will be strong with the investments we are making to help Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the century since Robert Borden established our social covenant with brave Canadians who risk their lives in the service of our country, it has been the job of the government to hold up its end of that deal. EOS BOS Yet veterans seeking fairness in a B.C. courtroom are told by government lawyers that this social covenant was only a political statement. EOS BOS Imagine. EOS BOS The minister finally acknowledged that a social covenant and sacred obligation does exist. EOS BOS Does the minister actually believe in the social covenant and will he drop his defence of the suit, or his new-found faith in our sacred obligation just a political statement only intended to get votes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on November 19, the minister appeared at the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, where he stated on the record his support for the social contract:The work our government does each day has been and can be called many things: duty, responsibility, commitment, social contract, obligation, sacred or not, or covenant. EOS BOS Colleagues, I believe it is all of those things. EOS BOS This is nothing new. EOS BOS I call on the member and his party to stop playing partisan games and get onboard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, cracks are starting to appear in the Conservative caucus over the Prime Minister's support of deadly asbestos. EOS BOS Conservative MPs are willing to risk the wrath of the Prime Minister and go behind his back to meet asbestos experts. EOS BOS Public health officials disagree with the Conservatives' dangerous approach. EOS BOS Scientists and doctors disagree. EOS BOS The Canadian Cancer Society disagrees. EOS BOS Canadians disagree. EOS BOS When will the government take action to ban deadly asbestos? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for over 30 years, the Canadian government has supported the safe use of chrysotile. EOS BOS We are talking about risk management. EOS BOS Recent scientific studies have shown that chrysotile can be used safely when it is used in a regulated and controlled environment. EOS BOS This government will continue to act in the best interests of Canadians, while promoting the sustainable and safe use of our natural resources. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister can feed us the same old lines, but that cannot hide the cracks showing in the Conservative ranks. EOS BOS The Conservatives are wondering the same things as all Canadians. EOS BOS How can the government continue to export asbestos even though the risks are known? EOS BOS Why is the government abandoning workers in regions that produce asbestos?Will the government present a plan to help these regions make the economic transition? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are talking here about safe use, which means risk management. EOS BOS Recent scientific studies have shown that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment that is properly regulated, either at the national or international level. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the truth is that there are now 350,000 more unemployed Canadians than there were before the recession. EOS BOS These people spend an average of 16 weeks looking for work. EOS BOS Over the past six months, the private sector has not created one single net new job. EOS BOS Not a single net new job. EOS BOS That is the Conservative record. EOS BOS In light of these facts, how can the Conservatives keep telling us that everything is fine and dandy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. EOS BOS Since the end of the global recession, over 800,000 new jobs have been created in Canada. EOS BOS We are very proud of that. EOS BOS Our government has put an economic action plan, a plan for economic growth, before the House. EOS BOS That is our goal. EOS BOS To date, nearly 400,000 new jobs have been created. EOS BOS Since the beginning of the global recession, the good news is that economic growth is on the way, and we will continue to work very hard on that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives cannot replace high-quality manufacturing sector jobs with part-time McJobs and call it a win. EOS BOS Give me a break. EOS BOS A CIBC study showed that disparities in Canada's labour market are making the country's economic situation worse. EOS BOS There are too many jobs without workers and too many workers without jobs. EOS BOS Those are not the NDP's facts. EOS BOS That comes from one of Canada's biggest banks. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives realize that they have to focus on training unemployed Canadians rather than plug the gaps with temporary foreign workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have some good news for the leader of the NDP. EOS BOS Eight hundred and twenty thousand net new jobs have been created since the end of the recession. EOS BOS The better news is that 90% of those net new jobs are full-time jobs. EOS BOS That is a great start, but the job is not done. EOS BOS As long as there is one Canadian looking for work, the government will remain focused on job creation and economic growth. EOS BOS When it comes to skills training, it is this government that has increased the transfers to provinces by 3% a year, something substantive and meaningful for job creation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last spring I tabled a motion in this chamber calling for an apology to the 100,000 British home children who were sent to Canada from 1869 to 1948, most of them simply used as cheap labour throughout their childhood. EOS BOS Last Thursday, the House unanimously passed a similar motion, and I thank the member for Montcalm and all the members of the House. EOS BOS When will the government present an official apology to the British home children and their descendants, and what measures will be taken to ensure that survivors and families can take part in this important moment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member's work on this motion. I am happy to say that unanimously we all supported it and we will be studying the question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as of January 2012, more than 420,000 criminal records still had not been updated. EOS BOS Worse yet, criminal offences that should be in the criminal record repository have apparently never been entered. EOS BOS This situation is unacceptable when we consider that a pedophile could be working at a daycare because his record has not been checked. EOS BOS Instead of putting on a show with ineffective legislation that costs the taxpayers a pile of money, will the Minister of Public Safety finally take action, having already been informed of this situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government supports law-abiding Canadians who selflessly give their time to coach and volunteer with vulnerable groups such as children. EOS BOS We encourage the RCMP to work with its policing partners to ensure that criminal record checks are done as efficiently and effectively as possible. EOS BOS Our government has taken steps toward making the process more efficient. EOS BOS Through our leadership, we have reduced the wait times from 17 weeks to 4 weeks. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, serious allegations of sexual harassment have once again surfaced at the RCMP, demonstrating yet again the failed leadership of the minister and his government to act on this mounting crisis. EOS BOS For too long, women officers have suffered abuse and have been re-victimized as they have come forward. EOS BOS The government introduced a weak bill, criticized by witness after witness for failing to put an end to sexual harassment in the RCMP.Will the minister commit today to working with the RCMP, with the women officers affected and with stakeholders to put an end to this endemic problem? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, over the past few months Canadians have heard extremely disturbing reports about the conduct of some RCMP officers over the past number of decades. EOS BOS That is why our government made it clear that we would work closely with the commissioner of the RCMP to take action and restore pride in Canada's national police force. EOS BOS That is why I introduced the enhancing RCMP accountability act that would strengthen the RCMP's ability to deal with these matters. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the NDP voted against it and put nothing in its place. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Caroline O'Farrell, the first female member of the RCMP's Musical Ride, was sexually assaulted and harassed by former colleagues. EOS BOS Now she is suing them because government after government failed to do its job. EOS BOS Canadians and RCMP members deserve better. EOS BOS They deserve better than a bill that does not even include the words “sexual harassment”. EOS BOS They deserve better than a Minister who will not let the RCMP speak freely to parliamentarians. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stamp out the endemic problems within the RCMP? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the member back to the House and congratulate her on the birth of her child. EOS BOS In respect of the issue, I understand that the RCMP did not advise the officer that he could not attend the committee meeting. EOS BOS However, issues with respect to human resources and the management of the RCMP are the responsibility of the commissioner. I do not involve myself in the day-to-day operations of the RCMP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when we formed government, the average processing time for family reunification was 22 months. EOS BOS Time and time again in Brampton East I hear that this is putting immense pressure on parents, spouses, and children. EOS BOS Could the hon. EOS BOS Minister of Immigration please give this House an update on our government's commitment to reducing the wait time for family reunification? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Brampton East for his hard work on behalf of his constituents. EOS BOS We inherited an immigration system that was broken. EOS BOS Applicants faced long processing times, which usually kept families apart. EOS BOS This is why we worked really hard to make sure that we attacked that processing time, lowering it, and now we have a new standard of 12 months for all family class applications EOS BOS . 
              We will continue to lower processing times, and I commit to the hon. member and this House that we will have better client service in the immigration department. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in typical Conservative fashion, spending plans for food safety were quietly released on the last day of sitting before the Easter break. EOS BOS Conservatives are cutting Canada's food safety program by $38 million, eliminating more than 300 full-time staff. EOS BOS No wonder they wanted to hide the report. EOS BOS New legislation at improving food safety will require resources to make it work. EOS BOS How can the minister defend these reckless cuts to food safety, and why did he hide these cuts from Canadians? EOS </s> BOS There is absolutely nothing hidden, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS These are public documents that go up on websites, that are tabled in the House of Commons. EOS BOS Anybody who wants to read them can. EOS BOS I will have someone read them to the member for Welland should he so desire. EOS BOS At the end of the day, we continue to build the capacity at CFIA. EOS BOS We constantly increase its budgetary ability to move forward. EOS BOS We constantly hire front-line food inspectors. EOS BOS We will continue to do that, despite their voting down every one of those initiatives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not true. EOS BOS He should read his report on plans and priorities before voting in favour of this budget because it includes $38 million in cuts—$38 million. EOS BOS It is not just the administration that will be affected. EOS BOS Food inspection services will also be affected, and inspectors who are actually doing the work are the ones who will lose their jobs. EOS BOS The health of Canadians is in jeopardy, and the industry is concerned about declining health standards. EOS BOS Will the minister come back and explain to the parliamentary committee how overworked CFIA employees will cope when 300 positions are cut? EOS </s> BOS It would come as no surprise, Mr. Speaker, that I completely reject the premise of that question. EOS BOS There have been no cuts to food safety at CFIA. EOS BOS Certainly, we are looking for efficiencies at CFIA and every other agency and department of this government. EOS BOS We have found those and we are moving forward. EOS BOS I will be happy to come back to Parliament when we have the supplementary estimates (A), the supplementary estimates (B) and the supplementary estimates (C) that continue to build the capacity of CFIA to do the great job it does. EOS BOS I would be hopeful at that time that the NDP would actually see fit to vote for those increases. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the finance minister a clear question, but the answer I got was about as clear as mud. EOS BOS It is just like the muddled answers that small business owners are getting from the CRA. EOS BOS Because they cannot get a clear answer, small businesses are fearing the worst: yet another Liberal tax grab. EOS BOS Again, I ask the minister, will the new rules requiring Canadians to report the sale of their principal residence on their tax returns eliminate any portion of the capital gains exemption if they run a small business from part of their home? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we continue to focus on how we can ensure that Canadians have a fair tax system. EOS BOS We introduced measures to ensure that people reported the sale of their principal residence. EOS BOS I can tell the member that this is an important thing to ensure that people get the appropriate tax exemption. EOS BOS I can say that CRA has a process to allow people the principal residence exemption, which continues to be the case. EOS BOS There is no change. EOS BOS People will continue to have their exemption from tax on their principal residence sale through that process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Monday the government reported to the House in writing that no deal had yet been signed with Bombardier. EOS BOS Yesterday the office of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development said the deal was sealed by March 24, five days before the company announced a 50% pay hike for its executives. EOS BOS What a coincidence. EOS BOS Now each of these executives will earn more in four days than the average Canadian earns all year long. EOS BOS I guess they will not have to work on Fridays either. EOS BOS If this agreement actually exists, did it ban Bombardier from using Canadian tax dollars for these outrageous bonuses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the aerospace sector is one of the most innovative and export-driven sectors in Canada. EOS BOS It accounts for more than 200,000 high-quality jobs in Canada and represents over 1% of our gross domestic product. EOS BOS The repayable contribution announced a few months ago will create 1,300 good-quality jobs and maintain 4,000 others. EOS BOS The long-term competitiveness of our aerospace industry is important to grow our economy and our middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, members of the billionaire Bombardier Beaudoin family have super-voting shares that give them a majority of the votes with a minority of the stocks. EOS BOS That allows family members to elect themselves to be executives and pay themselves, in the case of Pierre Beaudoin, 10 times the industry average. EOS BOS If the company raised money by issuing shares, they would dilute their votes and lose company control. EOS BOS Is it not true that the government bailout is really about protecting the feudal privileges of this billionaire family? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government was elected to grow the economy, to grow the middle class, and to help more Canadians join the middle class. EOS BOS In that context, key investments in the aerospace industry are important. EOS BOS We are going to support that industry, which contributes more than 1% of the total GDP in our country. EOS BOS In this particular case of a reimbursable contribution, it will also help maintain 4,000 jobs and create 1,300 additional new jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are continuing their attacks on Canadian heritage lakes and rivers. EOS BOS By weakening the Navigable Waters Protection Act and thus eliminating protections for our lakes and rivers, all through measures hidden in a second massive budget implementation bill, the Conservatives are allowing the development of infrastructure that could harm these same waterways without requiring that environmental assessments be conducted first. EOS BOS How many lakes and rivers will be laid to waste and how many environmental assessments will be set aside because of Bill C-45? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Navigable Waters Protection Act has always been about navigation, not the environment. EOS BOS This has been the case since it was introduced in 1882. EOS BOS This is nothing new. EOS BOS There is not a word about the environment in the actual act. EOS BOS My colleague is referring to another act, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, which was amended last spring. EOS BOS She need only reread that amended legislation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have excluded from protection many northern rivers which northerners rely on for navigation, such as the Nahanni River, the Liard River, most of the Yukon River, the Bear River and even the Slave River, which drains 80% of the water leaving Alberta and has been used for barging for more than 100 years. EOS BOS It is now excluded from protection. EOS BOS This could be opened up for a major power dam. EOS BOS Is it the government's intent to remove any controls and development on the Slave and these other rivers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Navigable Waters Protection Act has always been about navigation, not environment. EOS BOS This has been the case since 1882. EOS BOS There is not a word about the environment in the actual act. EOS BOS My colleague is referring to another act, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, which was amended last spring. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is a familiar story. EOS BOS The Conservative premier of Newfoundland and Labrador says, “We have a deal. EOS BOS ” The Conservative Prime Minister of Canada says, “ EOS BOS Oh, no, you don't.” EOS BOS Here we go again. EOS BOS The feds say today they will only help displaced plant workers, but back in October 2013 a spokesperson for International Trade Canada said, “ EOS BOS The program will address fish and seafood industry development and renewal as well as workers whose jobs are displaced....” EOS BOS The government says it likes to be clear, so now is the time to be clear. EOS BOS Will the fishing industry of Newfoundland and Labrador receive its $280 million, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canada-European Union trade agreement is by far Canada's most ambitious trade initiative ever. EOS BOS Every region of this country stands to benefit, including Newfoundland and Labrador. EOS BOS The minimum processing requirements fund was created to compensate for anticipated losses from the removal of minimum processing requirements. EOS BOS The fund was never intended as a blank cheque that would give the industry in Newfoundland and Labrador an unfair advantage over other Atlantic provinces. EOS BOS We have been clear from the start that the MPR fund was to compensate for demonstrable losses. EOS BOS Our officials remain open to receiving proposals from their provincial counterparts on how to move forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government's unbalanced approach means that while many families are being left behind, Scotiabank made $6.5 billion in profit last year. EOS BOS Today, that same bank fired 1,500 workers, most of them here in Canada. EOS BOS There were 400,000 lost manufacturing jobs, virtually no job creation in the private sector in more than a year and the youth unemployment rate is twice the national average. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Finance explain exactly how his wasteful and ineffective income splitting scheme for wealthy families is going to do anything for the more the 1,000 Canadians who are today out of a job? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that was such a grab bag of questions. EOS BOS Let me focus on the issue of youth unemployment, which was raised. EOS BOS Under our Conservative government, Canada will continue to have one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the G7. EOS BOS Since coming into office, we have helped 2.1 million youth obtain jobs, training and skills. EOS BOS However, we recognize more has to be done, and under our economic action plan 2014, we will help young Canadians get the skills they need for in-demand jobs, help young entrepreneurs start more businesses and support paid internships. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Governor of the Bank of Canada warns that we are facing a low or zero-growth jobs recovery. EOS BOS He said that over 900,000 Canadians are trapped in part-time jobs and 200,000 young Canadians cannot get work at all. EOS BOS Governor Poloz is “pretty sure these kids have not taken early retirement”. EOS BOS He said that we need policies such as investment in infrastructure to boost growth. EOS BOS Why is the government hamstringing its own capacity to act with an income splitting plan that offers no benefit to 86% of Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are providing, through our family tax plan, benefits to over four million families. EOS BOS The NDP and the Liberals would rather give funding to large bureaucracies. EOS BOS Every family with children will have more money in their pockets to spend on their priorities as a family. EOS BOS These benefits are widespread and the large majority will go to low-income families. EOS BOS Our government is fulfilling its promise to balance the budget. EOS BOS We are now in a position to fulfill our promise to help Canadian families balance theirs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are replacing the child tax credit with a regressive income splitting scheme. EOS BOS Both cost about $2 billion a year, but the child tax credit helps significantly more families. EOS BOS It helps single parents and it also helps families where both parents earn similar wages. EOS BOS The Conservatives' new income splitting scheme will leave these families out in the cold. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives scrapping the child tax credit and taking this money away from single parents just to pay for their regressive income splitting scheme? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, it is a question that is based on a false premise. EOS BOS Every single family with children under 18 will benefit from these tax breaks. EOS BOS The majority will go to low- and middle-income families. EOS BOS Also, 25% of the benefits will go to families earning less than $30,000. EOS BOS The average cash in their pockets will be more than $1,200. EOS BOS This is a very progressive measure. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Jim Flaherty did not believe that this was a progressive measure and that is why he opposed it. EOS BOS In fact, there are over one and a half million single-parent families in Canada. EOS BOS These families got help from the child tax credit, but they will not get a dime from this income splitting scheme. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives scrapping a program that helped single parents and replacing it with an income splitting scheme that will leave these single-parent families, some of Canada's most economically vulnerable families, out in the cold? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, single-income families will benefit from the new family tax credit. EOS BOS The increased and expanded universal child care benefit will benefit every family with children under six and families with children from six to under 18. EOS BOS There will also be an increased child care expense deduction, and of course, there is the doubling of the children's fitness tax credit. EOS BOS Every one of the more than four million families with children will benefit from these great measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, rather than blindly cutting food inspection services and increasing taxes on practically all consumer goods, the Conservatives could be acquiring effective tools to combat tax evasion and thereby recover up to $8 billion a year, according to independent studies. EOS BOS However, that is not what they are doing. EOS BOS Their report on plans and priorities for the Canada Revenue Agency contains many cuts that have a direct impact on investigative services, such as closing the voluntary disclosure centre in Montreal. EOS BOS The government has transferred the centre's responsibilities to Shawinigan without providing that office with any additional resources. EOS BOS Why is the government cutting thousands of jobs at the CRA when it should be redoubling its efforts to combat tax evasion? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are keeping tax rates low by closing tax loopholes and by making the system fairer. EOS BOS All the efficiencies identified in budget 2013 apply only to internal operations and will not affect CRA's audit or enforcement capabilities. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, we have increased our resources to international tax evasion by over 40%. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the facts just do not support the minister's claims. EOS BOS The fact is that Conservatives are taking $68 million from the returns compliance section of the CRA, which is responsible for enforcing “compliance with Canada's tax laws”. EOS BOS They are also cutting $120 million and over 250 full-time staff from the reporting compliance section, whose job is detecting non-compliance “through risk assessment, audit, investigation”.Will the minister now stand up and acknowledge she is cutting the very CRA sections responsible for going after tax cheats? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have previously informed the member in the House, efficiencies identified in the budget apply only to internal operations. EOS BOS They will not in any way affect CRA's audit or enforcement capabilities. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, since 2006, we have increased resources on the international tax evasion file by 40% and we have identified more than $4.5 billion in unpaid taxes. EOS BOS This compares to just $174 million in the last year of the Liberal government. EOS
BOS Except that 75% of this money is postponed until after 2019, Mr. Speaker.
							[Translation]By abolishing the mandatory long form census, the Conservatives compromised the reliability of our official statistics to the point where it is having a negative impact on the economy and good governance. EOS BOS The Institut de la statistique du Québec confirmed that the number of disadvantaged families has been underestimated and that income has been estimated incorrectly. EOS BOS The institute has said that things are such a mess that decisions are being made blindly. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives attacking Statistics Canada? EOS BOS Why did they do something so ideological, out-of-touch, harmful and—to use a word that the Prime Minister used today— EOS BOS stupid? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not at all the case. EOS BOS As we did in 2011, we will collect quality statistics in 2016 that our government, the governments of every region of the country, the private sector and our researchers can use to glean useful information about the entire country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Kevin Garratt, a Canadian citizen who for years has assisted humanitarian programs into North Korea from his café in Dandong, China, has been imprisoned in China since 2014, indicted on phoney and unsubstantiated charges of spying. EOS BOS While our previous Conservative government spoke out strongly on Mr. Garratt's behalf, protesting the lack of evidence, the Liberals have only expressed concern. EOS BOS Why is an innocent Canadian being abandoned so the Prime Minister can pursue his fresh start with China? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the Garratts have not been abandoned by this government. EOS BOS We continue to be engaged on this file. EOS BOS We have expressed our concern for the well-being of the Garratts, and we have repeatedly raised the issue with Chinese officials at the highest levels EOS BOS .
               We will continue to persist in our call for their return home safely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is now being reported in Turkish media that the individual who was detained for allegedly helping three British schoolgirls join ISIS was working for the Canadian embassy in Jordan, where Bruno Saccomani, the former head of the Prime Minister's security detail, is the ambassador. EOS BOS Can the government confirm that someone linked to Canadian intelligence, an employee, an agent or an asset, is being detained in Turkey? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, we are aware of some of these reports. EOS BOS However, I cannot comment on operational matters of national security. EOS BOS I would like to remind the House that the threat of terrorism, the international jihadi movement against Canada, is real. EOS BOS We just have to look at the news. EOS BOS Day after day we are hearing of more instances of people who have allegedly left Canada to join ISIL, to fight for ISIL beliefs. EOS BOS Canadians know that it is this government that is bringing forward legislation to better protect Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last night's committee testimony underlined that the sweeping changes Conservatives have put forward in Bill C-51 are excessive, unnecessary, and dangerous to our freedoms, but what really stood out last night was the disrespect shown to a witness. EOS BOS The member for Calgary—Nose Hill suggested that the National Council of Canadian Muslims had ties to Islamic terrorist groups and that they were, in her words, “half-hearted in the fight against terrorism”.Will the member apologize for her disgraceful behaviour? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the international jihadist movement has declared war on Canada and its allies, countries like Canada that believe in openness and tolerance. EOS BOS We see this again and again in the news. EOS BOS We have seen recent attacks here in Canada, Paris, in Copenhagen and Australia. EOS BOS Let me talk about the reasons why we brought forward Bill C-51. EOS BOS Our national security agencies have identified serious gaps in the existing legislation that they need to better protect Canadians. EOS BOS That is what this government is doing. EOS BOS We brought forward common-sense measures and I certainly hope that the NDP will eventually get on our side. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Ronald Atkey, a former Conservative minister and chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, stated very clearly that allowing CSIS to ask a judge to violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms will turn into a constitutional nightmare. EOS BOS Why does the government want to rush a bill that is ill-conceived? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday we heard from a number of witnesses. EOS BOS It was the second day of testimony. EOS BOS The first day, of course, was Tuesday with both the Minister of Public Safety and the Minister of Justice appearing. EOS BOS We look forward to continued debate and information coming from all sides with their views on this. EOS BOS Talking about the gaps that have been identified by our national security agencies, it was very clear when Commissioner Paulson said that it would also be very helpful in respect of those people we do not know anything about. EOS BOS He was referring to the information-sharing aspects of this particular bill. EOS BOS We have brought forward these common-sense measures and I certainly hope the opposition parties will get on board. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is easy to call oneself a feminist, but standing up for gender equality takes action. EOS BOS My colleague from Burnaby South did just that with his bill designed to get more women into federal politics. EOS BOS However, yesterday, 126 Liberal MPs voted with the Conservatives to defeat the bill. EOS BOS Even the Minister of Status of Women voted to defeat the gender equality act. EOS BOS When women make up only 26% of the House, why did the Liberals vote to defeat the bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleagues on the opposite side of the bench for their commitment to gender parity, for ensuring that we bring not only more women to participate as candidates but allow them to win and actually come to this place, and once they get here, allow them to succeed and feel like they belong. EOS BOS While we agree with the spirit of the member's bill, the bill was flawed. EOS BOS I offered to work with the party opposite to bring forward measures after we have heard from the Special Committee on Electoral Reform to ensure the unintended consequences that the bill presented initially are addressed. EOS BOS I remain committed to that and I look forward to working with members. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Ms. Boisvert retired from the CRA in April 2016. EOS BOS On June 15 of that year, she got a paycheque by mistake, and now she is being told to pay back the gross amount even though deductions were taken. EOS BOS She has taken steps to resolve the matter, but the full gross amount is being withheld from her severance pay. EOS BOS My office has been trying to reach someone since February to clean up this Phoenix mess, which comes on top of so many others, but nobody even acknowledges our communications. EOS BOS When will the minister help Ms. Boisvert and admit that her pay system is broken beyond repair? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are doing our best to make things better for public servants who are suffering because of Phoenix. EOS BOS People not getting paid is unacceptable. EOS BOS We have procedures in place to help public servants. EOS BOS If the member gives me the individual's name, we will do our best to fix the problem. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Phoenix pay system has been a disaster for Parks Canada employees. EOS BOS Even while working hard to help Canadians celebrate Canada 150, they found themselves going months without proper paycheques. EOS BOS Adding even more injury to this insult, these workers have been without a contract since 2014. EOS BOS When will the government fix this Phoenix fiasco for our public servants, and when will it show Parks Canada employees respect by bringing a fair offer to the bargaining table? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have tremendous respect for the important work done by our hard-working public servants. EOS BOS We have actually re-established a culture of respect for our public servants. EOS BOS When we formed government, all collective bargaining agreements had expired with Canadian public servants. EOS BOS Some had been expired for four years. EOS BOS We negotiated in good faith, to the point that today 90% of public servants in Canada have collective bargaining agreements. EOS BOS That has been done in good faith with our public servants, and we will continue to work hard to serve Canadians with our world-class public service. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians continue to be gouged at the pumps in northern Ontario. EOS BOS Thunder Bay, Atikokan and Fort Frances have some of the highest gas prices in the country. EOS BOS Despite gas prices falling in the rest of Canada, prices in northern Ontario are not budging. EOS BOS In fact, some are inching upward. EOS BOS When will the government finally support our proposal for a gas ombudsman to ensure the people of northern Ontario are not being gouged at the pumps? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has taken action when it comes to prices at the pumps. EOS BOS We have put in place the Fairness at the Pumps Act. EOS BOS We have put in place a regulation after consultations with the folks in northern Ontario and elsewhere to ensure that the regulation is meaningful for everyday consumers. EOS BOS My colleague thinks that gas prices should somehow be regulated or that there needs to be an ombudsman. EOS BOS This is an area of provincial jurisdiction and I would encourage him to call the provincial premier and suggest that idea. EOS BOS We on this side of the House believe in taking action to support consumers and put more money in their pockets by lowering taxes, which we have done, and by preventing any company from gouging consumers through our legislation, which we have done. EOS BOS We continue to ensure that consumers are adequately protected at the pumps. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in my riding of Langley, families have been forced to endure constant turmoil when the sex offender of their child was permitted to serve house arrest in their neighbourhood. EOS BOS In one case, a sex offender served his sentence across the street from the young victim. EOS BOS In another case, it was right next door. EOS BOS This is why I introduced Bill C-489, the safe at home bill. EOS BOS This bill would prohibit child sex offenders from coming within two kilometres of their victim's home. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Justice please inform the House as to the government's position on this important bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for Langley for standing up for the rights of victims. EOS BOS I am proud to indicate that the government fully supports this legislation and I urge all members of the House to do so as well. EOS BOS The legislation is consistent with our past efforts to crack down on violent offenders. EOS BOS For instance, we have already eliminated the use of house arrest for child sexual offences. EOS BOS Canadians gave us a strong mandate to promote the rights of victims in Canada. EOS BOS The safe at home bill from the member for Langley would do precisely that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. EOS BOS government House leader if she could tell us what the business of the government is for the rest of this week and, if she is able to, for the week when we return after our constituency week. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this afternoon the House will resume consideration of the opposition motion. EOS BOS Tomorrow, we will continue second reading debate of Bill C-23 on pre-clearance. EOS BOS [English]
              Monday, March 6, and Thursday, March 9, shall be allotted days. EOS BOS In terms of legislation for that week, we will be focusing on report stage of Bill C-22, concerning the national security committee of parliamentarians. EOS BOS I wish all members a good week in their constituencies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance had a deathbed conversion, suggesting the possibility of increasing voluntary contributions to the Canada pension plan. EOS BOS He did not even mention the provinces, although two-thirds of them would have to support it. EOS BOS Instead of playing the politics of cynicism, why does this government not commit to working with the provinces to improve the Canada pension plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, we know the Liberals do not want to give Canadians choices. EOS BOS They want to force Canadians to pay higher job-killing payroll taxes. EOS BOS By contrast, our government believes that Canadians want to pay lower taxes. EOS BOS They also want the freedom to make their own financial decisions. EOS BOS That is why we are open to giving Canadians the opportunity to invest into a voluntary Canada pension plan. EOS BOS That is what we do. EOS BOS We give Canadians the opportunity to save for a secure, dignified retirement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has spent nine long years in office and many years before that opposing every conceivable reform to the CPP. EOS BOS Simply put, the Prime Minister hates the Canada pension plan. EOS BOS Now he comes up with a last-minute plan that was not even in the budget. EOS BOS Why should Canadians believe for one second that the Prime Minister is serious about doing anything at all with the Canada pension plan, except to blow it all up? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are proud that this government has spent nine years cutting taxes for Canadians, bringing forward options so they could save for retirement. EOS BOS We intend to consult with experts and stakeholders during the summer on options for allowing for additional voluntary contributions to the Canada pension plan. EOS BOS Our government understands that Canadians want low taxes and the freedom to make their own choices. EOS BOS However, the Liberals would impose a job-killing payroll tax. EOS BOS We know the Liberals would shut down the tax-free savings account. EOS BOS We know they would take away income splitting, and income splitting for pensioners. EOS BOS We will not let that happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after years of ethically challenged Conservative rule, the Liberals promised to do things differently. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS It is hard to hear the question. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Outremont has the floor. EOS BOS Let us try to calm down, everybody. EOS BOS We are all excited. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Outremont. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after years of ethically challenged Conservative rule, the Liberals promised to do things differently. EOS BOS The Minister of Justice is doing certain things differently. EOS BOS When Conservative minister Shelly Glover was caught holding a dodgy fundraiser in 2013, she promptly gave the money back, but this minister refuses to do the same. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister ask his Minister of Justice to simply give the money back? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, indeed, after 10 years of ethical failings on behalf of the government, the Liberal Party got elected to government on a platform of openness and transparency and promises that we are keeping. EOS BOS We have always followed all the rules around fundraising. EOS BOS We have always demonstrated openness and transparency and accountability. EOS BOS Union and corporate donations are banned. EOS BOS There are very strict limits on donations to the parties. EOS BOS We are following all rules, unlike the previous government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' laissez-faire economic policy is causing more and more collateral damage. EOS BOS Last Friday, 360 workers at the Camoplast factory in Roxton Falls found out that their jobs will disappear in July 2013. EOS BOS Those jobs are being transferred to Mexico. EOS BOS Nearly one-quarter of the people of Roxton Falls will lose their jobs. EOS BOS This is a tragedy for families and local businesses. EOS BOS The region's economy will be hit hard. EOS BOS Do the Conservatives have a plan to protect jobs like these, or will they continue to stand idly by and watch the manufacturing sector crumble? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has a plan, the economic action plan, which is responsible for the creation of over 750,000 jobs since the recession in 2009. EOS BOS We have introduced measures that foster a healthy investment climate, create jobs and drive economic growth. EOS BOS We have reduced taxes, eliminated tariffs on machinery, and introduced a hiring credit to help businesses recruit employees. EOS BOS We have implemented measures to stimulate the economy and safeguard our industries in a climate of healthy competition. EOS BOS The NDP could have voted for those measures. EOS BOS That would certainly have helped. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier in question period the Prime Minister claimed that his minister had actually apologized to a disabled veteran's wife who was insulted by the minister. EOS BOS Now that turns out to simply not be true. EOS BOS The CBC is reporting that, in fact, he is attacking her for speaking out against him and has not apologized. EOS BOS I want to give the Prime Minister an opportunity to correct the record. EOS BOS Will he admit that his minister has not apologized, and will he start showing Kim Davis the respect that she deserves? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government takes very seriously the responsibility of responding to Canadians' concerns and helping our veterans and helping Canadians with disabilities, and we will continue to. EOS BOS The minister responded to those particular allegations and he apologized for earlier ones. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, instead of apologizing, the office of the Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities used Facebook screenshots to discredit a citizen. EOS BOS Let us review the facts. EOS BOS The minister insulted thalidomide victims. EOS BOS He was condescending toward a young mom. EOS BOS He was rude to the wife of a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder by telling her that she chose to marry him. EOS BOS When did blaming the victim become the norm for this government? EOS BOS When will the minister show some compassion? EOS BOS When will he take responsibility for what he did and show that he is worthy of his title? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to improving the lives of veterans and their families. EOS BOS We are aware of the concerns of Ms. Davis. EOS BOS That is why we have improved financial security. EOS BOS That is why we have improved the front-line services. EOS BOS That is why we have opened offices. EOS BOS That is why we have improved caregiver benefits. EOS BOS I am working on meeting with as many Canadians as we can to improve their lives. EOS BOS I am also working on myself to improve interaction on a go forward basis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear about what has happened here. EOS BOS First, the minister said the Liberals have no duty to a disabled veteran's wife. EOS BOS Then, his staff tried to shame and discredit her when she spoke out by sending to the media multiple screen shots of her personal Facebook posts in a veterans support group. EOS BOS Instead of being compassionate, the minister launched a taxpayer-funded political attack on a veteran's wife. EOS BOS Why did the minister order his staff to publicly humiliate Kim Davis instead of telling them to do their jobs and help veterans and their families? EOS BOS Why is the PM okay with it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I met with Kim Davis some two years ago, and I thanked her and her husband for their tremendous service to our country. EOS BOS I went to the fact that our government was increasing financial security, that our government was opening offices, that our government was improving their lives, that our government was going to improve the outcome of the caregiver benefit. EOS BOS These were a result of direct conversation with veterans and their families. EOS BOS I too remember specifically thanking Ms. Davis, particularly for her and her family's service to country. EOS BOS I told her that we would work as hard as we could to benefit both her and her family. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite promising not to do so in the last election, these Liberals took veterans back to court. EOS BOS Now we have learned that veterans are being forced to wait longer and longer to get the benefits they have earned. EOS BOS Today the Prime Minister is hurrying off to Asia to deliver on his priority: infrastructure handouts to the world's wealthy. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Veterans Affairs tell us why veterans are being shortchanged while the Prime Minister sends half a billion dollars to wealthy bankers in Asia? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, delivering timely benefit decisions is an area where we can and we must do better. EOS BOS In 2015-16, we saw a 25% increase in the number of disability claims, and that is a good thing, because that means more veterans are coming forward for the help they need. EOS BOS To address this increase, we are simplifying the benefits process, hiring more staff, and giving the benefit of the doubt to the veterans. EOS BOS When it comes to veterans' care, we can always strive for excellence, and we will. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, instead of strengthening the border, increasing efficiency, the government decided to cut and slash border services to Canadians. EOS BOS It is cutting front-line border officer jobs, including 40 intelligence officers, and the detector dog programs. EOS BOS When we cut $143 million from border services, we get thickening of the border, longer wait times and an open invitation for organized crime to enter and exist Canada. EOS BOS Why is the government risking the public safety of Canadians in border towns? EOS BOS Why is it watching all our jobs be lost by thickening of the border and longer wait times at the border? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, since coming to office, our government has increased front-line border officers by 26%. EOS BOS We have taken steps to make the border faster and more efficient for law-abiding Canadians. EOS BOS However, what I can tell members is the continuous opposition to working together with our American partners in order to ensure that criminals and other undesirables do not enter into our North American perimeters is in fact delaying matters. EOS BOS I would ask that member to consider his own constituency instead of continually speaking against his own interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would invite the minister to come to my riding to see first-hand that the numbers he just gave are not at all effective. EOS BOS Budget cuts have consequences. EOS BOS Ignoring the problems, as the Conservatives are doing, will not make them go away. EOS BOS What did this government do for border security? EOS BOS It cut $143 million from our customs budget. EOS BOS This translates into the following: more crime in border communities, increased risk that our children will come into contact with drugs, and more illegal weapons on our streets—all contributing to a more dangerous Canada. EOS BOS Can the Conservatives tell us why they have walked away from their responsibility to protect border communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me repeat. EOS BOS Since coming to office, our government has increased front-line border officers by 26%.When we bring in legislation to toughen up our laws in order to ensure that criminals, in fact, dangerous and violent criminals, spend time behind bars, that member stands and votes against it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today in the Superior Court of Quebec begins the court challenge of Bill 99, the law that recognizes the right of the people of Quebec to independence. EOS BOS Forcing Quebec to defend a basic principle of democracy is where Ottawa's federalism has taken us. EOS BOS The federal government, under Stephen Harper, decided to involve itself in the case. EOS BOS Will the government withdraw from these proceedings and finally recognize Quebec's right to self-determination? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to upholding our constitutional values and to upholding co-operative federalism. EOS BOS Under the previous government, Canada was added by Mr. Henderson as a third party to proceedings. EOS BOS As such, we are obligated to appear and participate in proceedings. EOS BOS Our government believes that Bill 99 is constitutional insofar as it is interpreted in a way that is consistent with the Canadian Constitution and within the jurisdiction of the legislature of Quebec. EOS BOS It would be inappropriate for me to comment further, as this matter is before the courts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as far as I know, the current government is not bound by the commitments of the former government. EOS BOS Quebeckers from all walks of life, not just separatists, have denounced Ottawa's involvement in this case. EOS BOS The National Assembly even passed a unanimous motion, but it seems the Liberals do not give a damn about that, just as Stephen Harper did not give a damn. EOS BOS They are supporting those who question Quebec's right to independence, but they still expect us to believe that Ottawa is not trying to imprison Quebec in Canada. EOS BOS Will the federal government withdraw from the legal challenge of Bill 99, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again I am happy to stand up and say our government is committed to upholding constitutional values and to ensuring and upholding co-operative federalism.
              As this matter is before the court, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, dairy farmers produce some of the highest quality milk as the basis for many of the great products we enjoy. EOS BOS The supply management system has kept this industry stable for farmers and consumers. EOS BOS Is the Minister of International Trade planning on scrapping any part of the supply management system in the trans-Pacific partnership agreement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that we have made a very clear commitment to support Canada's supply management system. EOS BOS At the same time, consultations are ongoing about the compensation that will be paid under CETA. EOS BOS This is an agreement that will drive economic prosperity in Canada for many years to come. EOS BOS That is why we have had support all across the country, from every sector of our economy, for this agreement, which will drive economic growth and create jobs for many years to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the manufacturing sector is a cornerstone of Canada's economy, but countries are becoming increasingly competitive when it comes to attracting high-tech investment. EOS BOS With nearly one in eight jobs here in Canada linked to foreign investment, could the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development update the House on the government's efforts to attract high-quality jobs within our country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Niagara Centre for his question and for his efforts as a former mayor and now a member of Parliament, in promoting economic development. EOS BOS From day one, our government has been focused on attracting job-creating investments to this country. EOS BOS Today, our commitment is paying off with GE Canada selecting Welland, Ontario, as the location for its new “brilliant factory”. EOS BOS This facility will create 150 jobs in phase one and begin production in 2018. EOS BOS We are working with Export Development Canada, and this initiative speaks to our commitment to growing the economy and creating jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the high spending President of the Treasury Board seemed pretty cavalier about the fact that the Prime Minister's staffers have been charging taxpayers for huge meal bills, in violation of the department's guidelines. EOS BOS That was when we thought the bill was $68,000. EOS BOS Now we find that it is $130,000, and he is still not blushing. EOS BOS It cost $7,000 for one pizza party in the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS Would they put the chicken brochette platter aside for one minute and tell us why they think it is okay for the Prime Minister's staff to break rules that are in place to protect the taxpayers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I find it curious that the opposition members will not even disclose any of their expenses, yet they stand in their places and criticize a government that has cut hospitality expenses by 48%.That kind of hypocrisy is not tolerated by taxpayers. EOS BOS We are on the side of the taxpayers. EOS BOS We are not on the side of the tax hiking, carbon hiking people on the other side. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while staff of the Prime Minister's Office stuff their faces with pizza at the taxpayers' expense, every day over 18,000 children in Quebec have to rely on breakfast clubs so they do not start the day on an empty stomach. EOS BOS In his bubble, the President of the Treasury Board thinks that the rules do not apply to the Conservatives and that it is completely normal to spend $130,000 on lunches for the Prime Minister's staff. EOS BOS However, Canadians expect a government that will not throw their money out the window. EOS BOS How many awards do the Conservatives have to get from the pig in a tux before they stop wasting taxpayers' money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the members of the NDP caucus do not want to disclose their expenses to the people and taxpayers. EOS BOS However, we do. I can tell you once again that we have cut these costs by 48%. EOS BOS We are therefore on the side of taxpayers, not of the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, FRAPRU recently released a report prepared by a committee of 14 experts who consulted 200 organizations and over 100 individuals. EOS BOS According to this report, a quarter of a million households in Quebec have critical housing needs. EOS BOS Will the minister agree to have this report tabled in the House? EOS BOS Will she consider its recommendations and will she finally renew operating agreements with social housing providers? EOS BOS I have repeatedly asked this question—could I get an actual answer this time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear. EOS BOS Economic action plan 2013 renewed the homelessness partnership strategy and it renewed the affordable housing agreements. EOS BOS It will continue to deliver new homes for Canadians across the country. EOS BOS We are very focused on ensuring that CMHC as well as our housing responsibilities are dealt with. EOS BOS I encourage the opposition opposite to support our budget and support economic action plan 2013 so Canadians can have a roof over their heads. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is twice now that the Minister of National Defence has not answered my questions directly. EOS BOS I will give him a third chance. EOS BOS With respect to the selection of the Auditor General, yesterday his colleague said that they had chosen this candidate for the position because he was the most meritorious, despite the fact that the government itself insisted that the candidate should be bilingual. EOS BOS Is the position of the government that there was no candidate who was both meritorious and bilingual? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, our government's position was very clear. EOS BOS The government looked for bilingual candidates. EOS BOS After an exhaustive process, the most meritorious candidate was chosen. EOS BOS Mr. Ferguson is an extraordinary person. EOS BOS He wants to learn French and has already started taking lessons. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the former chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board is pointing to an alarming trend in tribunal decisions. EOS BOS Ninety per cent of appointments were made by the Conservatives. EOS BOS We have the lowest rate of refugee approvals in Canadian history. EOS BOS Refugee cases should be based on merit and need, but the former chair is accusing the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism of injecting partisan politics into the judicial process. EOS BOS Why is the government tainting a system that should be independent and fair? EOS </s> BOS To the contrary, Mr. Speaker, this government put in place by far the most rigorous pre-selection and screening process for appointees to the IRB in the history of our asylum system. EOS BOS Only 10% of the people who apply for membership in the IRB make it through the independent and arm's-length pre-screening process. EOS BOS I can attest to the quality of those individuals. EOS BOS I have been responsible for recommending over 140 appointments or reappointments and all of these individuals have made it through this rigorous, independent pre-screening process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, maybe the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism should stop recommending, because more than half of current IRB members have either failed the qualifying exam or been screened out for incompetency. EOS BOS This is a former chair of the IRB who is speaking out. EOS BOS He said the IRB is “not fully independent” and the minister's improper criticism of refugee claimants is “unprecedented” and its rulings are causing division in the Federal Court. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism start doing his job, put competence ahead of politics and ensure that we have a fair IRB process? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, 90% of people who apply for membership in the IRB do not make it through the pre-screening process. EOS BOS Only 10% are recommended. EOS BOS That is one out of every ten. EOS BOS An hon. EOS BOS member: They're all Conservatives. EOS BOS Hon. EOS BOS Jason Kenney: No, Mr. Speaker, they are not. EOS BOS In fact, I am aware of I think 2 out of 140 who have any association with the Conservative Party, unlike the Liberals who appointed the spouses of members of Parliament, the spouses of Liberal senators and failed campaign managers. EOS BOS The Liberals used the IRB as a partisan dumping ground. EOS BOS We have respected its role as an independent, quasi-judicial organization. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Friday we learned that the government plans to slash $31.5 million from immigration settlement services in Ontario. EOS BOS Community organizations are already struggling because of similar cuts last year and the year before. EOS BOS Ontario remains the number one destination for immigration in Canada. EOS BOS Why is the government making it harder for newcomers to access the services that they need? EOS </s> BOS To the contrary, Mr. Speaker. We are now providing three times more in funding for immigrant settlement services in Ontario than was the case under the previous Liberal government. EOS BOS Next year, Ontario newcomers will receive more than was the case in 2005. EOS BOS It is true, however, that the number of immigrants settling in Ontario has declined quite significantly, from 64% to 52% of newcomers. EOS BOS They are going to other provinces; it is only fair that the settlement dollars follow the newcomers and that we have fair funding across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister says he is doing better than bad. EOS BOS I guess that is the level that the government has set for itself. EOS BOS With this shuffling of funds, we are still looking at an overall cut of $6 million and $45 million in cuts from two years ago, but the number of newcomers is at an all-time high. Pitting EOS BOS province against province is not going to solve the deficit. EOS BOS This decision to cut services in Ontario was done without planning and with no warning. EOS BOS New Canadians are huge contributors to prosperity in this country. EOS BOS Will the minister maintain the key supports and services they need to thrive in this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the premise of the question is completely inaccurate. EOS BOS There has been a great deal of planning by my officials over the course of two years to ensure that the adjustment in funding from Ontario to provinces with growing immigration numbers happens in an orderly fashion. EOS BOS In terms of giving people notice, we just gave notice this week to the small number of organizations in Ontario that will be affected at the beginning of the next fiscal year. EOS BOS We have given them several months' notice. EOS BOS The question is, why does the member think that newcomers to Ontario should be receiving $4,000 per capita in settlement services but that those in the rest of the country should receive only $3,000? EOS BOS We believe that newcomers all across Canada deserve the same support. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, five former Supreme Court justices, seven former federal ministers and four former prime ministers, including one Conservative, are all worried about the harm that Bill C-51 could cause. EOS BOS This bill could undermine public safety and human rights. EOS BOS It does not provide for an effective oversight mechanism for CSIS.Why are the minister and the Liberal leader not heeding this wise advice? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that there is in fact oversight. EOS BOS There is already oversight with SIRC. EOS BOS This bill is also very cognizant of the fact that judicial oversight is necessary for acting upon some of the intelligence that will be gathered by our security agencies. EOS BOS There is oversight with respect to the bill itself as it makes its way through the parliamentary process. EOS BOS There will be expert evidence heard, I am sure, at committee. EOS BOS We look forward to the further participation in this important debate aimed specifically at addressing security needs in our country in this elevated environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister should listen to the advice of these former prime ministers and Supreme Court justices, because they warn that “...experience has shown that serious human rights abuses can occur in the name of maintaining national security”. EOS BOS They recognize that our current oversight regime is wholly inadequate. EOS BOS In fact, our oversight is so lacking that it is uniting former Liberal and Conservative prime ministers. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives turning a deaf ear to such reasonable concerns? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think the one individual the member is referencing kind of united with himself a long time ago. EOS BOS Oversight with respect to judges is something that I think all members present would be quick to embrace. EOS BOS The fact is that these powers, extraordinary though they might be, are necessary in the current threat environment. EOS BOS The judicial oversight that comes at the front end of the process, as opposed to political oversight after the fact, which is what is being suggested by the members opposite, we think is preferable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in short, the minister is dismissing reasonable concerns for no reason at all. EOS BOS No one should face profiling or live under a cloud of suspicion because of their faith, yet the Prime Minister and the Conservatives have repeatedly targeted Muslims. EOS BOS They are creating anger and are feeding division. EOS BOS In contrast, American President Barack Obama is reaching out to Muslims. EOS BOS He is looking to them as partners in the fight against radicalization. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister apologize for his offensive comments toward Muslim Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is so completely untrue and completely offensive and completely far off base when it comes to what we are attempting to do as a government through this legislation, to enhance safety, protection, and security for all Canadians. EOS BOS Security does not discriminate. EOS BOS We are attempting to elevate the security of our country from a very real and evolving threat. EOS BOS The member opposite decides, throughout this debate, to somehow scare people about what the security forces are doing rather than what the terrorists are posing as a threat to our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we learned this morning that the Conservatives' blind cuts and their misplaced priorities are hindering the fight against child pornography. EOS BOS Although the number of sordid cases is increasing, the Conservatives tried to save $10 million at the expense of victims. EOS BOS Every year, 40,000 tips are received, but the RCMP does not have the resources it needs to investigate all these cases. EOS BOS Why did the minister appropriate $10 million allocated to the fight against sexual predators and child pornography? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely false. EOS BOS That member should not let the CBC do the research for her. EOS BOS Let me be clear, no funding for the protection of children from sexual predators has been cut. EOS BOS The RCMP did not spend the full budget allocated to the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre due to human resource challenges stemming from the nature of work, and I think members can imagine the nature of the work involved here, and high qualification standards. EOS BOS That member's remark was absolutely false. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, child pornography investigations are not the only thing suffering as a result of the Conservatives' surreptitious cuts. EOS BOS According to a new report, for the past eight years, 20% of the funding allocated to the RCMP has been returned to the consolidated revenue fund. EOS BOS The RCMP commissioner admitted that those cuts are affecting the fight against organized crime in particular. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives claim that keeping Canadians safe is a priority when they are diverting funds intended for the RCMP? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that question by the member just shows how the opposition cannot be trusted with this country's finances. EOS BOS In fact, the previous Liberal government lapsed over $3 billion from this agency. EOS BOS The member opposite is simply trying to play politics over an accounting issue. EOS BOS The truth of all of this is that seven times our Conservative government brought forward new resources to fight terrorism, and seven times the NDP and the Liberals voted against these resources. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, rumour has it that the mysterious infrastructure investment bank would be set up as a crown corporation. EOS BOS On the surface, that seems fine, but if we dig deeper, we see that there will be major consequences. EOS BOS What it means is that this bank, which will handle billions of dollars in private and public investment, will not report to the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS It will be shielded from the watchful eye of our primary budget watchdog. EOS BOS Is the Liberal government setting up a sweet little secret garden where it can make covert deals with its friends? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, during the campaign, we promised that we would mobilize private capital to build more infrastructure for Canadian communities. EOS BOS Municipalities and provinces have identified a huge infrastructure deficit. EOS BOS We have doubled our investments from $60 billion, more than doubling, to $180 billion. EOS BOS We will mobilize private capital through the bank to build more infrastructure. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, not satisfied with going after the unemployed with its misguided reform, the federal government now wants to isolate them by cutting off verbal contact between public officials and the organizations that have helped the unemployed in Quebec for at least 30 years. EOS BOS From now on, the Boucherville centre can receive only faxes and mail. EOS BOS No one is identified as a contact, and there is no guarantee of a reply. EOS BOS Indeed, the Conseil national des chômeurs et chômeuses is still waiting for a reply to a fax sent last Thursday. EOS BOS Why would the government want to isolate the unemployed other than to weaken them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in the House earlier today, we are consolidating EI processing to ensure the system is more effective and efficient for all Canadians. EOS BOS Third party groups will continue to be able to advocate on behalf of clients and we are looking at ways to ensure they have opportunities to do this in a timely fashion. EOS BOS Canadians will continue to receive the service they have received in the past and that they should expect from Service Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last Sunday was International Human Rights Day, the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. EOS BOS [English]
              Could the hon. EOS BOS Minister of Justice please update the House on the very important work she is doing to promote and protect human rights in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this week, along with my colleagues the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Canadian Heritage, I had the honour to host the first summit on human rights with my colleagues from the provinces and territories, the first summit in almost 30 years. EOS BOS Meeting with civil society and indigenous leaders, we discussed how we can work together to ensure that Canada continues to comply with its international human rights obligations, as well as to ensure that we remain a leader in the world with respect to human rights. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under the Conservatives, insiders are allowed to play by different rules than the rest of us. EOS BOS The Conservative appointees to EI boards clearly violated government guidelines when they donated money to the Conservative Party. EOS BOS Now, we learn that the Conservatives are repeating their mistakes. EOS BOS They recently appointed 10 more failed Conservative candidates and party operatives to the new Social Security Tribunal. EOS BOS When is the minister going to stop these patronage binges and when is the government going to make the Conservative Party return these donations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has actually taken steps to replace the previous employment insurance boards and they are being replaced with the new Social Security Tribunal. EOS BOS Now, the members of the Social Security Tribunal are, of course, appointed through a rigorous process, a rigorous selection process that ensures that they have to meet specific experience and competence--Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS government House leader has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Thank you, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS They have to meet specific experience criteria and, of course, they have to demonstrate competency criteria. EOS BOS This ensures that appointments are made based upon merit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not enough that they are going after unemployed Canadians, Conservatives are also misusing regional economic development agencies to help their Conservative insider friends. EOS BOS Officials at ACOA rigged hiring rules—yes, rigged rules—to ensure that a failed Conservative candidate and former political aides got jobs. EOS BOS The process was so bad that the Public Service Commission revoked two of the appointments. EOS BOS When will they stop using ACOA as an old boys' club and return to the mandate of providing jobs and economic opportunities for Atlantic Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the independent investigation by the Public Service Commission did not find any evidence of any wrongdoing or influence on the part of ministers or any political staff in this matter. EOS BOS I hope that member is listening. EOS BOS The Public Service Commission report clearly states, “ EOS BOS No evidence was found to support allegations of political influence in the ACOA investigations.” EOS BOS ACOA has taken actions on all the recommendations of the Public Service Commission. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives delivered a balanced budget, completed over 7,200 infrastructure projects, created over 1.2 million jobs, and set up P3 Canada to leverage private sector dollars, which delivered over $6.6 billion in additional infrastructure. EOS BOS The Liberals gave us a $30-billion deficit, zero new full-time jobs, and they are taking $15 billion away from communities for their bank. EOS BOS With this record, how can they call Canadians stupid and irresponsible for questioning their methods? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government, along with industry, has created an environment which has created 139,600 jobs since we took office. EOS BOS To illustrate that point, we have invested in small business as well, for example, in new equipment to improve processes for G-Pak Technology Inc., in British Columbia, the same province that the member represents. EOS BOS That created 65 jobs in South Surrey—White Rock, a Conservative-held riding. EOS BOS We are making investments regardless of which riding it is, to make sure we have growth and opportunities for our small and large businesses. EOS BOS We are creating jobs. EOS
BOS Zero net new jobs, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS Over 99% of announced infrastructure projects by the Liberals are not yet under construction, and zero new full-time jobs have been created since they took office. EOS BOS Announcing projects in a community does not equal breaking ground, starting construction, or job creation. EOS BOS Getting infrastructure projects built is what creates jobs. EOS BOS Does the minister understand that simply announcing and reannouncing infrastructure projects in communities does not create jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's priority is to create jobs and create growth. EOS BOS That is why, since taking office, we have approved 980 projects, with a combined value of $12 billion from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS That is including a project that is currently under way, along with 70% of the other projects, in Surrey, British Columbia, the member's own riding, which she represented as the mayor of the city, asking for the same projects to be funded by the federal government that we are funding now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all we know about this new infrastructure bank is that the Liberals are considering selling and privatizing Canadian assets. EOS BOS They want to increase fees and tariffs and take $15 billion that was allocated to the municipalities only to spend it on this infrastructure bank, which will not be available to small or mid-size municipalities. EOS BOS I have a very simple question for the Minister of Infrastructure: can he name one municipality with a population under 50,000 that might be able to use this bank? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we understand we need to invest in Canadian communities of all sizes, large urban centres, small communities, and mid-size communities. EOS BOS It was our government that made an historic $2 billion commitment to invest in smaller communities, which we made as part of the fall economic update. EOS BOS Only $15 billion out of $180 billion is being allocated to build new projects, transformed projects, in all kinds of communities from coast to coast to coast. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member is unable to answer such a simple question because it is just not going to happen. EOS BOS There is no municipality with a population of less than 50,000 that will have projects worth more than $100 million. EOS BOS We now know that the investors the government met with are looking for a minimum return on their investment of 7% to 9%. EOS BOS How do the Liberal government and the party's cronies plan to accomplish that? EOS BOS There will need to be higher fees at Canadian ports and airports and more tolls on the highways. EOS BOS What I am seeing is endless Liberal taxes. EOS BOS After a year, they have created no jobs and Canadian taxpayers have to pay more taxes. EOS BOS Does the government realize that the only thing it has managed to create in a year is more taxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, while we are focused on creating jobs for the middle class and growing the economy for hard-working Canadians, what are the opposition members focused on? They are focused on opposing taxes for the wealthiest 1% of Canadians. EOS BOS They are focused on opposing increased enhancements to CPP. EOS BOS They are opposing tax breaks for the middle class. EOS BOS As I said earlier, out of $180 billion for infrastructure, the vast majority of the money will be delivered to municipalities of all sizes, the way we have done in the past, creating jobs— EOS
BOS The member for North Island—Powell River. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, we learned that the Liberals have hired a corporation that is in the business of buying infrastructure to study the benefits of privatizing our infrastructure. EOS BOS I wonder what it will discover. EOS BOS This, after a report from private sector recommending an infrastructure bank to create tolls and user fees to pay off the private sector. EOS BOS What is next? Stacking an NEB panel with oil industry insiders? EOS BOS Oh, wait, that has been done. EOS BOS The government was elected to invest in infrastructure. EOS BOS Why is it so determined to sell it off? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would be interested in knowing about the plan by the member and her party to grow the economy and invest in infrastructure. We are making historic investments, $180 billion over 12 years, that will help grow the economy, create jobs for the middle class, as well as help municipalities and communities, of all sizes, to be more socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. EOS BOS That is the commitment we made to Canadians, and that is the commitment we are delivering on. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the commitment that was made to Canadians was to actually have access to invest in infrastructure and not to privatize it. EOS BOS [Translation]As Michael Sabia, a government adviser, has previously said, investors in this infrastructure bank will want to see a 7% to 9% return. EOS BOS Based on current interest rates, we are talking about spending four times more than if the government made those investments itself. EOS BOS This infrastructure bank is like a PPP project or structure on steroids. EOS BOS Ontario's auditor general recently concluded that PPP infrastructure projects had cost almost $1 billion more than if Ontario had gone ahead with the investments itself. EOS BOS Does he understand that the definition of madness is to— EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were elected on a platform to invest in historic planned infrastructure, including the creation of the infrastructure bank. EOS BOS The role of the bank is to build more infrastructure, not less infrastructure. EOS BOS $180 billion of historic investment, and leveraging with the private sector, will help Canadian municipalities to build the public transit they need, to build the recreational facilities they need, help us grow our economy, and create jobs for the middle class and those who are working so hard to join that middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the CN line runs through the cities of Montreal and Ahuntsic from west to east, and the CP line runs though from north to south. EOS BOS As everyone knows, more and more oil is being transported by rail these days. EOS BOS The Department of Transport and the rail companies have reportedly been given risk studies. EOS BOS In the spirit of transparency, will the Minister of Transport release those risk studies to the public? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has done an awful lot when it comes to ensuring the safe transport of our natural resources here in Canada. EOS BOS One of the things we have done is that we are working with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities on sharing information needed for first responders. EOS BOS The federation has, of course, been very grateful for the information we do provide. EOS BOS With respect to these risk assessments, they are considered proprietary information. EOS BOS They will be utilized in good faith by Transport Canada officials to ensure that we are doing everything we can to ensure that the regulation of this oil by rail is done as properly and as safely as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence is willing to stifle, silence, and outright contradict government and military officials, all to save face for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Despite what the defence minister says, official documents prove there is no capability gap in our fighter fleet, it was the Liberals who cut danger pay to our troops, and our allies were not happy with the decision of the Liberals to withdraw our CF18s from the fight against ISIS. EOS BOS When will the Minister of National Defence admit he is misleading Canadians, and put an end to his dirty little habit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question, but not all the language he used. EOS BOS We are committed to ensuring we deliver for our troops. EOS BOS When we looked at the massive cuts that were made by the previous government, we conducted a defence policy review. EOS BOS That is why we are going to be ensuring, when we launch the defence policy review, that we have the appropriate investments in looking after our Canadian Armed Forces and our men and women who serve us into the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is an expert in “alternative facts”. EOS BOS First, our allies did not like Canada's new mission in Iraq and asked that we continue our air strikes. EOS BOS Second, Canada is not in need of fighter jets. EOS BOS This is a Liberal invention to offer Boeing a nice $7 billion contract. EOS BOS Third, the Canadian Armed Forces urgently need equipment, but the Liberals cut the procurement budget by $12 billion and silence everyone involved with a lifetime gag order. EOS BOS What percentage of the minister's answers are not “alternative facts”? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would remind the member opposite that last year I also stated that the fight in Iraq could not happen from the air, that it had to happen from the ground. EOS BOS That is when we tripled our trainers and doubled the intelligence. EOS BOS I am happy to say that it is actually having an impact on the ground right now. EOS BOS That is one of the reasons we are having that success on the ground. EOS BOS We are going to ensure our troops have all the appropriate equipment. EOS BOS We are going to be launching a full competition to replace our entire fleet. EOS BOS When we launch our new defence policy, we will be outlining to Canadians and to all parliamentarians our plan to look after the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is no compromising when it comes to torture. EOS BOS Either we are for it or we are against it. EOS BOS The government says that it does not employ torture, but it is okay if others do so. EOS BOS The Conservatives would use information obtained at any cost. EOS BOS The Conservatives cannot ignore international conventions. EOS BOS The government is not above the laws of Canada. EOS BOS The law is the law. EOS BOS Where is this government's respect for Canadian law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has always obeyed the law, and our position is very clear: Canada does not condone the use of torture and does not engage in this practice. EOS BOS That is clear. EOS BOS CSIS and its employees are subject to Canadian law. EOS BOS That continues to be our government's position. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not the message Canadians are getting. EOS BOS Yesterday, the Minister of National Defence acted irresponsibly by suggesting that the Air Canada Centre was a prime target for terrorists. EOS BOS Then the Minister of Public Safety  soon followed with his own hypothetical scenarios about planes full of Newfoundlanders being blown up. EOS BOS All of that to back up the government's irresponsible message to other countries that Canada is in the market for information based on torture. EOS BOS The government should oppose torture, no question about it. EOS BOS When will it rescind the directive? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me be clear again, Canada does not condone torture and does not use torture. EOS BOS However, Canada will use information to save lives. EOS BOS Let us talk about logic. EOS BOS Yesterday, the NDP justice critic stood outside the House and basically accepted the position of the government. EOS BOS Then he came back inside the House and tried to suggest some other high-handed position. EOS BOS That is something that confuses Canadians. EOS BOS Our position is clear. EOS BOS Our position sends a strong message to those working in the defence and security sector and to our allies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not a message from Canadians. EOS BOS That is not where we are at. EOS BOS The Conservatives have lost their way on this point. EOS BOS The government is now saying that torture is okay. EOS BOS So much for being the law and order government. EOS BOS In this case it may as well torture people right here in Canada by the message its sending out. EOS BOS Then yesterday, or the day before, the Minister of Justice  was out publicly advocating for people to shoot warning shots. EOS BOS We heard that prisoners should hang themselves. EOS BOS We heard that from the Conservatives. EOS BOS People should shoot from the hip. EOS BOS Torture is okay. EOS BOS Those are the messages we are getting. EOS BOS This is not the wild west; this is Canada. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what a litany of misinformation and convoluted facts. EOS BOS The NDP justice critic's words yesterday were so twisted it would take a troop of boy scouts to try to figure out all the knots that he tied himself into. EOS BOS The reality is Canadians know exactly where the government stands, so do our defence and security officials. EOS BOS That is what is important. EOS BOS That rhetoric coming from the member opposite is not helping to keep Canadians safe in Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, over 235,000 people are without a home in our country. EOS BOS In Canada, housing should be a right. Liberals like to talk about the right to housing but are unwilling to enshrine it in law. EOS BOS Maybe this explains why not a single Liberal spoke on my bill, Bill C-325, during its second hour of debate. EOS BOS Are the Liberals keeping silent because they are just too ashamed to speak against the human right to housing? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to take this opportunity to say how important the right to decent housing is in Canada for everyone, and in particular for more vulnerable Canadians. EOS BOS We know how important housing is for life in communities and for life in a proper home to participate in the lives of everyone else around us. EOS BOS I have good news to announce in a very short time. EOS BOS I invite our colleague to listen very carefully. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in Essex, my office has been busy trying to help the many people who have not been paid because of the Phoenix pay system debacle. EOS BOS In one case, an employee was hired in 2015, and has worked so hard for the government that she has been promoted twice. EOS BOS Not only does she have more responsibility and a heavier workload, she has also not been properly compensated in over two years and is owed over $12,000 in back pay. EOS BOS It is disgraceful. EOS BOS The Liberals keep telling my office that the case is under third-party escalation, but there have been no changes and absolutely no help for this woman. EOS BOS When will this minister stop blaming the Conservatives and fix this shameful mess the Liberals have made? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are completely committed to resolving Phoenix. EOS BOS Fixing this is my number one priority. EOS BOS Make no mistake, this was mishandled from the beginning when it was treated like a cost-cutting measure instead of the complex business transformation initiative that it should have been treated as. EOS BOS We are getting to the bottom of the technological, governance, and policy mishaps that happened because of the decisions made by the previous government, and I can assure everyone that we are on top of this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Peter Cleary, the health minister's former senior adviser, has joined Santis Health, a registered lobbying firm that exclusively lobbies the federal government on behalf of health care clients. EOS BOS Not only was he her former adviser, but he was personally lobbied by Santis Health numerous times in 2017. EOS BOS He will now be the one lobbying the Liberals. EOS BOS Does the minister think it is acceptable for one of her senior staff to immediately accept a position with a company that is actively lobbying her and her department? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the hon. EOS BOS member would assume, the person he referred to, who is no longer working in my office, obviously met with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to discuss arrangements. EOS BOS Everything about his new position was cleared with the commissioner. EOS BOS The staff member will not be lobbying our government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, not only does Peter Cleary's new job raise red flags, but it turns out that all of Santis Health's principals worked closely with the Prime Minister's chief of staff and principal secretary at Queen's Park. EOS BOS Not only are they registered to lobby the Minister of Health, they also lobby the PMO. EOS BOS How can Canadians believe that a prime minister who only makes decisions that benefits his friends will not allow the PMO to be lobbied by its friends at Santis Health? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I certainly encourage the member opposite to not manufacture a concern that is not based on fact. EOS BOS The person about whom he is speaking has cleared this new position, and it is very clear he will not be lobbying this government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today marks the 10th anniversary since the motion on Jordan's principle was unanimously passed in this House. EOS BOS It highlighted the need for a child-first principle when it came to jurisdictional disputes involving the care of first nations children. EOS BOS The previous government completely ignored this motion, failed to take action, and in doing so, first nations children continued to be forgotten. EOS BOS Can the hon. EOS BOS Minister of Indigenous Services please update this House as to what is being done on Jordan's principle. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago today in this House, a motion was passed in honour of Jordan River Anderson, a first nations child who was denied access to care because of jurisdictional disputes. EOS BOS After almost a decade of inaction, we are making sure that no first nations child goes through what Jordan did. EOS BOS To this date, I am pleased to report that we have approved 29,000 requests for care, an approval rate of over 99% EOS BOS . We will make sure that every first nations child has access to the care they need. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Superior Court of Quebec had to issue an injunction to halt the drilling off the coast of Cacouna. EOS BOS To make matters worse, the Quebec Department of the Environment revealed that hammering work, which was not even mentioned in the authorizations granted, caused excessive noise within a perimeter five times larger than what was allowed. EOS BOS Rather than stopping the work, the Conservatives let the company regulate itself, without asking for any scientific advice from experts. EOS BOS When will the minister acknowledge her incompetence in protecting species at risk and terminate this project, which is unacceptable from both a human and an environmental perspective? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, protection of belugas is a priority for DFO. EOS BOS The current court case is about provincial laws and involves provincial officials. EOS BOS The only work that was taking place at Cacouna was exploratory work that was approved. EOS BOS Projects will only move forward if they are safe for Canadians and safe for the environment. EOS BOS TransCanada has not yet submitted the construction of a marine terminal for review at all. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the more we question the minister about what is happening in Cacouna, the more she convinces us that she does not know what is happening in her own department. EOS BOS She misjudged the noise impact of the exploratory work in Cacouna, and now we have also learned that the proponent conducted penetration testing, which no one had heard of before. EOS BOS How can the minister explain the fact that nothing was known about this testing or the noise impact of the work carried out off the coast of Cacouna? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us look at the facts. EOS BOS TransCanada's work was reviewed by DFO. EOS BOS We relied on the best available science. EOS BOS We imposed strict conditions for the work to go ahead. EOS BOS We made all this information public. EOS BOS This exploratory work was found not to cause any harm to the environment. EOS BOS At this point in time, only exploratory work has been approved. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on May 10 at 4:15 p.m., the Minister of Immigration  tried to pass on some bad news in his Friday statement in the hope that no one would notice. EOS BOS Although he lifted the hold that he himself had placed on immigration applications, he changed the rules, and now people will have to pay more than ever for parents or grandparents to be reunited with their families in Canada. EOS BOS Additionally, only a small number of applicants will be accepted next year. EOS BOS Why is the minister putting up barriers to family reunification? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to family reunification. EOS BOS In fact, thanks to our plan for faster family reunification, we are on track to cut the backlog and wait times in half so families will be reunited with their parents and grandparents. EOS BOS In 2012-13, we are admitting the highest level of parents and grandparents in 20 years. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, Sunday is Universal Children's Day and the government is celebrating with a dismal record on children and families. EOS BOS One in ten children live in poverty while the government offers boutique tax credits to wealthy Canadians. EOS BOS Two out of every five food bank users are children. EOS BOS Food inflation continues to rise and the government offers big tax breaks to corporations. EOS BOS Why does the government refuse to adopt a long-term, comprehensive strategy to eliminate poverty that would actually make it better for children and their families? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, every action this government takes is to help Canadians and their families become independent and able to contribute to the economy and to their communities. EOS BOS We have had a decline since the peak under the Liberals of 18.4% to 9.5% under this government for children living in low-income families. EOS BOS The poverty rate for children living with single mothers has fallen to an all-time low of 21.5% from the peak of 56% under the Liberals. EOS BOS This government is moving forward on reducing poverty for children. EOS BOS Why does the NDP not support our initiatives that are working? EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, these same old lines the government keeps using will not help children. EOS BOS The Conservatives can pat themselves on the back, but the reality is that the number of children living in poverty has not changed. EOS BOS Twenty years ago, the House unanimously passed a motion presented by then-NDP leader, Ed Broadbent, to put an end to child poverty in Canada. EOS BOS At least the government at that time was concerned about children. EOS BOS Why is the current government indifferent towards children, especially children living in poverty? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the average Canadian family now spends $3,000 less per year in taxes. EOS BOS Those are funds that Canadians can use to invest in their family and their own children, thanks to this Conservative government. EOS BOS Whether it is enhancing the national child benefit, or enhancing the child tax benefit, this government is working for Canadian families and their children. EOS BOS Why does the NDP not support these initiatives? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while seniors and the disabled were ignored in the 2013 budget, many touched by the so-called Conservative plan were clearly left reeling. EOS BOS Middle-class families now face increased taxation on essentials like electric household heaters, baby carriages and school supplies. EOS BOS Even blankets will now bear an extra 5% tax. EOS BOS Conservatives have lowered the price for yachts, but are clearly raising the price for daily essentials for families. EOS BOS The Liberals know that middle-class families need a break. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance finally admit that this is nothing short of a new tax on Canadians and agree to cancel it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will repeat that our low-tax plan continues. EOS BOS We started it in 2009 after the recession and we continue with it now. EOS BOS We are one of the few countries that has been able to reduce taxes as our economy continues to grow and as the number of jobs in this country continues to grow. EOS BOS That is important to Canadians. EOS BOS We will continue on that path, and it would be very nice if the opposition would actually read the good things in the budget to get Canadians back to work and keep the economy growing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the member does not want to lose his credibility, then he should call a spade a spade. EOS BOS An increase in import tariffs is an increase in taxes. EOS BOS The worst thing is that the middle class will have to pay. EOS BOS Montrealers are going to have to pay more, whether they are buying a coffee maker, a bicycle or children's shoes. EOS BOS It is as simple as that. EOS BOS Can the government be honest here? EOS BOS Will the government admit that this is a new tax and agree to cancel it in order to prevent the cost of living from going up? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of State for Finance. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I see the new leader of the Liberal Party is working on his heckling. I do want to say that what we put forward in the economic action plan, in budget 2013, continues on our low-tax plan. EOS BOS We are proud of the fact that during the recession we have been able to continue. EOS BOS We have actually reduced 150 different taxes to businesses and to individuals. EOS BOS The average family of four gets to keep $3,200 more in their own pockets. EOS BOS That is where we think it should be. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are increasing tariff taxes by $333 million every year. EOS BOS It is just like increasing the GST: a money grab to concoct the illusion of a balanced budget by 2015. EOS BOS To feed that fiction, Canadians will be forced to pay more for everything from tricycles at 4.5% more, baby carriages at 3% more and cosmetic wigs for cancer patients at 15% more. EOS BOS The government should cancel these new Conservative taxes and stop ripping off the middle class. EOS BOS Why will it not do it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I should remind you that the NDP and the Liberals voted against every tax reduction that we have put forward. EOS BOS Every initiative that we have made and put forward for Canadians— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of State for Finance still has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Thank you, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS Apparently the truth does hurt. EOS BOS We continue on that low-tax plan. EOS BOS That is very important for Canadians. EOS BOS We will continue on that path and we would like some support from the other side. EOS BOS Members on the other side seem to simply want to raise taxes on everything that comes before them. EOS BOS We will not do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for months now, the federal pay services have been a complete shambles. EOS BOS Some people are being paid twice as much, while others are not being paid at all and must borrow money to buy groceries. EOS BOS Normally, the managers responsible for such a mess should be rapped on the knuckles, but what do the Liberals do? EOS BOS They give out bonuses, yes sir, and we are not talking small peanuts: $5 million of our money to reward people who are incapable of paying employees. EOS BOS Is this the Liberal way of managing: rewarding the foolish and incompetent? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as parliamentary secretary and as the MP for Gatineau, I can assure my colleague that resolving the Phoenix pay system problems left by our previous government is our highest priority. EOS BOS I would like to remind the hon. EOS BOS member that the executives—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS Most members, on all sides, are able to listen to question period and hear things they do not like without reacting, without saying anything until it is their turn. EOS BOS I encourage others to do the same. EOS BOS The hon. parliamentary secretary. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the hon. member, my hon. EOS BOS colleague, that the executives directly responsible for Phoenix did not receive their performance pay. EOS BOS The minister asked the Auditor General to examine all aspects of Phoenix, something our honourable opposition should not be looking forward to. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been flipping through the Liberal platform, which has been nominated for several prestigious Canadian fiction awards, by the way, yet nowhere in this fantasy does it say anything about shovelling out millions of dollars for private company bonuses. I cannot seem to find the chapter that talks about paying millions more in bonuses to government executives who screwed up the lives of 82,000 public servants. EOS BOS When will the Liberals actually start helping working people in the country, instead of the wealthy and well-connected? EOS BOS Frankly, Canadians are getting tired of this old Liberal story. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure my hon. colleague that Canadians are welcoming the fact that we will fix this pay system, which we inherited from the Conservatives, that we will honour our public servants with respect, and that we will pay them on time with a pay system they demand. EOS BOS Perhaps my hon. EOS BOS colleague would be better off asking the Leader of the Opposition why, on March 12, 2012, she said that Phoenix “not only ensures the sustainability and increased efficiency of pay services for the Government of Canada, but also generates savings for Canadian taxpayers.” EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are worried about crime. EOS BOS That is why the government has kept its promise to pass comprehensive law-and-order legislation in the first 100 sitting days of Parliament. EOS BOS The Safe Streets and Communities Act sets out stiffer sentences for child predators and eliminates house arrest for serious crimes such as sexual assault. EOS BOS This legislation is now in effect across Canada. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Justice inform the House about the constitutional status of our government's crime legislation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that this week, our government's legislation to establish mandatory penalties for drive-by and other reckless shootings was found constitutional by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. EOS BOS While I will not comment specifically on court challenges, I can say with confidence that a majority of Quebeckers support tougher sentences for serious crimes. EOS BOS This is why we enacted mandatory sentencing for all sexual offences committed against children and for serious drug trafficking offences. EOS BOS We made a commitment to Canadians that we would quickly pass these measures. EOS BOS Canadians responded by giving us a strong mandate to do that. EOS BOS We make no apologies for that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, although we are in the middle of the busy holiday shopping season, sales are going to be down for some merchants this year. EOS BOS As everyone knows, more and more people are shopping online. EOS BOS When it comes to shops, all merchants are subject to the same rules; online, however, that is not the case. EOS BOS Quebec businesses have to pay taxes, but foreign companies do not. EOS BOS If this continues, all of our shops are going to die off. EOS BOS Why is the Canadian government working against local businesses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been very clear that e-commerce is critical to our economy. EOS BOS Overall, we are investing in small businesses. EOS BOS That is why we reduced the tax rate for small businesses. EOS BOS We are making sure that we are also investing in innovation to create opportunities for small businesses to grow in scale, so they can provide more opportunities and more jobs. EOS BOS That is why the unemployment rate has dropped from 7% to 6.4%. EOS BOS That is why over 600,000 jobs have been created. EOS BOS We are focused on job creation and growth, and better outcomes for consumers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 72% of Quebeckers, the Government of Quebec, our artists, our producers, the union, and management are all opposed to the special treatment of Netflix by the Minister of Canadian Heritage quite simply because this precedent is a threat to our culture. EOS BOS However, as we saw at yesterday's meeting with the Minister of Finance, no one from anywhere else in Canada wanted to address the issue. EOS BOS Is the Minister of Canadian Heritage jeopardizing our distinct culture in the name of the Canadian consensus? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government recognizes the importance of protecting culture and that is why we are taking concrete action. EOS BOS We have invested $2.3 billion, the largest investment in 30 years by the federal government, in our creative industries and the protection and support of the production of French and English content. EOS BOS We also decided to have the courage to modernize our system. EOS BOS Our laws date back to 1991, before the advent of the Internet. EOS BOS We will modernize the Broadcasting Act to ultimately protect our culture in the digital age. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, like other war resisters, Kimberly Rivera came to Canada because she did not want to serve in the Iraq war, a war she believed was unjust. EOS BOS She built a life here in Canada. EOS BOS Two of her children were born here. EOS BOS Yet she is scheduled for deportation tomorrow. EOS BOS Will the minister do the humanitarian and compassionate thing? EOS BOS Will he do the right thing and allow Ms. Rivera to stay? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, military deserters from the democratic United States are not refugees under the internationally accepted meaning of the term. EOS BOS However, all individuals have the right to due process, and once they have exhausted all of those legal avenues we expect them to respect our immigration laws and leave Canada. EOS BOS The one thing on this side of the House that we understand is that President Obama's administration does not persecute American soldiers. EOS BOS Just a warning to the other side: I hope members agree with that statement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians were surprised last spring when the agriculture minister appointed a failed Liberal candidate as his chief of staff; they were astonished when they learned she owned $140 million of egg quota; and, they were speechless when they heard the minister say that he sure did not see that as a conflict of interest. EOS BOS Now Canadians will learn that his chief of staff will be in court next week to face allegations of perjury over the purchase of egg quota. EOS BOS Canadians are curious. EOS BOS How deep does this rot have to go before the minister will act? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS The minister's chief of staff followed all of the relevant codes of ethics to the letter. EOS BOS I therefore do not believe that the chief of staff has done anything wrong. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, oil prices have fallen nearly 50% since the fall fiscal update. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has certainly been briefed on the current fiscal impact. EOS BOS Will he now tell Canadians exactly how much that drop in oil prices has affected the Canadian government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has been very clear. EOS BOS Obviously, the drop in oil prices affects the government's fiscal flexibility, but I have said repeatedly that the government will balance the budget this year. EOS BOS I note that the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself said today that even looking at his own numbers the government will be capable of balancing the budget this year. EOS BOS We are not in recession. EOS BOS We have every intention of balancing the budget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after two weeks of contradictions and ad libbing, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister are now saying that nothing has changed because of the price of oil. EOS BOS If that is really the case, why is the Prime Minister allowing his Minister of Finance to create uncertainty by postponing the budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is continuing its long-term plan to balance the budget, lower taxes and create jobs. EOS BOS Our plan is working. EOS BOS We can see the results. EOS BOS I understand very well that the Liberals and New Democrats prefer huge tax increases and deficits, but that is not our country's policy. EOS BOS That is why our economy continues to grow and why our policy is admired around the world. EOS
BOS Actually, Mr. Speaker, what Canadians deserve is better retirement security, and they will get that, plus a better government, in October.We have had a proud tradition of newcomers coming to Canada and building stable, prosperous communities here, but Conservatives have attacked that legacy: huge family reunification backlogs, new barriers for immigrants to become citizens, cuts to settlement services. EOS BOS It is no wonder that Canada has fallen from the top five countries in settling new immigrants. EOS BOS When will Conservatives stop using new Canadians as a backdrop for their photo ops and start actually helping immigrant families achieve success in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not surprising to see that member and that party dumping on the changes we have made to the immigration system because they voted against them all. EOS BOS They voted against the reform of our asylum system. EOS BOS They voted against measures to reduce backlogs. EOS BOS They voted against measures to protect the value of Canadian citizenship. EOS BOS We on this side are proud to have made the largest number of newcomers Canadian citizens last year, in Canadian history, and to be accepting the largest number of new immigrants to this country in decades. EOS BOS That is action. EOS BOS We are taking it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, of course we voted against the Conservatives' measures. EOS BOS Today, for the first time in seven years, Canada's score dropped in an international ranking on the integration of immigrants. EOS BOS This is a direct consequence of the Conservatives' bad policies. EOS BOS Just 26% of immigrants who arrived in 2008 became citizens, and the figures for family reunification were just as discouraging. EOS BOS Canada is no longer the model it used to be. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives restore Canada's former status when it comes to integrating immigrants? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is pathetic to hear a New Democrat claim the Liberals' immigration policy was a model. EOS BOS They left a legacy of backlogs, abuses and dashed hopes for immigrants who wanted to come to this country. EOS BOS Despite all of that, this year we are proud to be welcoming 280,000 new immigrants, and we are proud to have welcomed 260 new citizens last year. EOS BOS Those are the biggest numbers in Canadian history. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, thanks to negotiations between the U.S. and Chinese governments, Americans are now able to get 10-year multiple-entry visas to China, and even though Canada gives Chinese nationals 10-year visas, Canadians can only get a one-year visa for travel to China. EOS BOS This is unfair to Canadians who want to visit China or conduct business there, harms businesses, limits families, drives up costs, and makes our business sector less competitive. EOS BOS Will the government support my Motion No. EOS BOS 558 and immediately work with the Chinese government to obtain 10-year multiple-entry visas for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member obviously thinks we have our Canadian policies so right that they do not even deserve a motion from him. EOS BOS He needs a motion to go after Chinese policies for visas for Canadians. EOS BOS We have enhanced the business relationship with China in every way. EOS BOS There are more direct flights. EOS BOS There are more visas being issued. EOS BOS One-quarter of all the visas we issued in the world last year were issued to Chinese citizens, most of them 10-year multiple-entry visas, and yes, we will continue to work with the Chinese to ensure that more tourists come, that business expands, and that business people have every opportunity to grow a vital trade and investment relationship. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the minister clearly has no intention of showing any leadership here. EOS BOS We have been pressing the minister for months and he has yet to do anything tangible. EOS BOS The Americans managed to negotiate with China to get visas that allow unrestricted movement, including for business people. EOS BOS Canada is still lagging on this. EOS BOS Will the government show some leadership? EOS BOS Will it support my colleague's motion and work with the Chinese government to obtain a 10-year multiple-entry visa for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a bit rich for the NDP to ask us to support a motion to change the Chinese government's visa policies, when the NDP themselves voted against the investment protection agreement, and when they themselves voted against all our immigration reforms to help Chinese business people, tourists, and students come to Canada. EOS BOS This is just more NDP hypocrisy. EOS BOS The Conservatives, however, will continue to promote a very dynamic relationship with China. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, regarding the Belledune project, the Liberal members from Quebec do not seem to care much about the resolutions adopted by the municipalities calling for an assessment of potential risks to their residents. EOS BOS Some 220 rail cars transport crude oil every day, which is three times more than the number of cars that caused the Lac-Mégantic tragedy. EOS BOS Since the Minister of Transport likes to boast that rail safety is a top priority, would he rather run the risk of another Mégantic disaster or order an assessment of the project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as mandated by the Prime Minister, our government is reinforcing the safety of the rail transportation system. EOS BOS As such, the Minister of Transport is investing $143 million in budget 2016 to improve rail safety and the transportation of dangerous goods. EOS BOS Transportation officials will continue to monitor all federal railways for compliance to ensure safer levels of operation, and will not hesitate to act to enforce enhanced safety regulations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on the weekend, the Chief Electoral Officer said:My reading of the act is that I can no longer speak about democracy in this country. EOS BOS That is essentially what the bill says. EOS BOS The Chief Electoral Officer will be forbidden from discussing topics that have not been pre-approved by the Conservatives. EOS BOS How will muzzling the Chief Electoral Officer promote voter turnout? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the question is based on misinformation. EOS BOS Firstly, the changes we are making to section 17 of the Canada Elections Act will shift Elections Canada's ads to more practical notions such as how, where and when to vote. EOS BOS That is the information that Canadians need, young Canadians in particular. EOS BOS Secondly, the Chief Electoral Officer will continue to be obliged to speak before Parliament and before committees. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in reality, the new bill limits what information the Chief Electoral Officer can provide the public on four topics: how to become a candidate, how to add one's name to the voters list, the location and date of the vote, and the identification that is required for voting. EOS BOS The bill would even make it illegal for the Chief Electoral Officer to participate in a media scrum like the one he spoke to as he was leaving the Parliamentary committee on Thursday. EOS BOS Why have the Conservatives added this clause, which violates the basic principles of freedom of expression? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP members have not read the Canada Elections Act. EOS BOS Sections 533, 534 and 535 already require the Chief Electoral Officer to testify and submit a report before Parliament, which automatically becomes public. EOS BOS These sections are not being changed in any way in the Fair Elections Act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are tilting the playing field to their advantage. EOS BOS Their removal of the ability to take an oath and vouch at the polls would impact some groups more than others. EOS BOS The Chief Electoral Officer said, “ EOS BOS Groups that come to mind are aboriginals, young people, even seniors who...have increasing difficulty producing proper ID documents”.Experts are warning that these changes are likely unconstitutional. EOS BOS Why does the minister want to make changes that would make it harder to vote and that are likely unconstitutional? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, the member is wrong. EOS BOS Twenty-five per cent of cases where vouching was used resulted in irregularities, according to Elections Canada's own reports. EOS BOS The same reports said that the irregularities were serious in nature. EOS BOS In fact, the Ontario Superior Court invalidated some votes as a result of the irregularities related to vouching. EOS BOS Now the fact that the Supreme Court later overturned that ruling does not change the fact that it is very serious when any judge has to invalidate votes because of vouching irregularities. EOS BOS There would continue to be 39 acceptable pieces of ID, and Elections Canada would be required to inform Canadians what they are. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister has to stop playing fast and loose with the facts and start answering questions. EOS BOS The minister knows full well that the 25% statistic for vouching while voting has nothing to do with fraud. EOS BOS It refers to the fact that “the tick [box] confirming that vouching was required was not checked”.Does the minister really think that unchecked tick boxes are the biggest dangers that our voting system faces, and does he really feel this justifies making it harder for Canadians to exercise their right to vote? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, here is what I really think. EOS BOS I think that Elections Canada's own report should be listened to. EOS BOS Here is what it says:Averaged across 308 ridings, elections officials made over 500 serious administrative errors per electoral district on Election Day. EOS BOS Obviously, this is unacceptable. EOS BOS Aside from legal concerns, public trust in proper administration of the electoral process is at serious risk if these error rates are not addressed. EOS BOS That is Elections Canada's own report. EOS BOS That is what I am listening to when we make these laws. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is shutting down debate on legislation that changes the way elections are run in this country. EOS BOS It is shutting down debate— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. Order. EOS BOS The government side will have an opportunity to respond to the question when the member for Toronto—Danforth has finished putting it. EOS BOS Until then, I would ask them to come to order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Toronto—Danforth. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is trying to shut down debate on legislation that would change the way elections are run in this country. EOS BOS It is shutting down debate on a bill that is supposed to combat electoral fraud but that instead would target Elections Canada and ordinary Canadian voters. EOS BOS It would also give Conservatives an unfair advantage. EOS BOS Would the government at least allow Canadians to have their say on it? EOS BOS Will it support the NDP's proposal for cross-country hearings on Bill C-23, the unfair elections act? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member does not want any debate at all. EOS BOS In fact, he declared his opposition to the bill before he even read a single word of it. EOS BOS But that being said, all Canadians will be able to have their voice heard. EOS BOS We encourage them to make submissions to the committee and the committee can decide which witnesses it wants to hear from right across the country. EOS BOS I will be listening to Elections Canada's own report, which said on the issue of vouching, “ EOS BOS Too frequently, the errors are so serious that the courts would judge them to be ‘irregularities’ that violate the legal provisions that establish an elector's entitlement to vote”. EOS BOS Some 25% of cases have irregularities. EOS BOS That is too high. EOS BOS We are going to protect Canadians against fraud. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government promised legislation a year and a half ago. EOS BOS It has introduced a bill that is quite likely unconstitutional and that could prevent tens of thousands of people from voting. EOS BOS Why does the government not hold public hearings across the country to ensure that this bill is tailor-made for Canadians and not for the Conservatives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary committee will obviously be able to hear testimony from Canadians from all regions of Canada. EOS BOS That is still the case and will be for these discussions. EOS BOS At the same time, we will protect the integrity of the vote by preventing methods that have shown a high rate of error and giving more powers to the commissioner to enforce the law. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as countries gather at the UN climate conference in Doha, Canada has already won two fossil awards, because the government has undermined global efforts to address climate change. EOS BOS This week, Canada ranked 58 out of 61 countries on climate policy, trailed only by Kazakhstan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. EOS BOS Canadian is listed as the worst performer in the developed world. EOS BOS When will the minister and his failed sector-by-sector approach take real action on climate change and end the international humiliation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party has no basis to even talk to this issue when all it has had with regard to climate change policy is a 30% increase in greenhouse gas emissions, a $15 billion carbon tax and a dog named Kyoto. EOS BOS When we compare that with our track record, we are seeing a stabilization of greenhouse gas emission growth and we have also seen our economy grow. EOS BOS We are getting it done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, documents released through access to information indicate the Minister of International Trade left her officials in the dark about her vanity trip to California and there are significant factual inconsistencies with the answers the minister has provided about her California dream trip. EOS BOS She billed the taxpayer-funded junket to L.A. around her late night TV appearance. EOS BOS Does the minister believe that her ministry is just an extension of her so-called celebrity journalism career? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister visited Los Angeles to reinforce the important economic relationship between California and Canada. EOS BOS California and Canada conduct over $40 billion in annual bilateral trade. EOS BOS The minister has made it clear that all the rules appropriate were followed with this trip. EOS BOS In addition to round tables with the business community and creative industries during the Los Angeles trade mission, the minister was proud to promote Canada to an American audience, including Canada's leadership on the Syrian refugee file. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know the minister rescheduled her personal vanity trip to California from October to November, after she was appointed to cabinet. EOS BOS Emails released through access to information indicate her staff was left in the dark until the final days of her L.A. departure. EOS BOS Apparently, no one but the minister knew she was going to L.A. to spend some time with Bill Maher. EOS BOS When is the minister going to be honest with Canadians and admit the trip was about her and not about her job as the trade minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, one group of people who were not in the dark about the minister's trip to California was the business leaders, the academic leaders, and the government leaders that she met with when she was in California to promote Canadian trade. EOS BOS Forty billion dollars a year in bilateral trade is something we think is important. EOS BOS If the member does not think so, then he has a different view from this side of the House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, given their Ottawa-knows-best attitude, it is no surprise that the Liberals are telling the provinces and territories how they should invest in health care. EOS BOS Not only do the Liberals feel it is their job to control everything health care related, but shamefully, they have even begun accusing the provinces of misspending the money they already get. EOS BOS This is far from the collaborative approach that the Liberals promised Canadians and the premiers. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop trying to interfere in provincial jurisdiction? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it was my privilege to have a meeting this week with my counterparts, the ministers of health in the provinces and territories. EOS BOS It is absolutely essential in the matter of health that we collaborate with all partners that are involved, including people in government. EOS BOS I am pleased to say that I also had consultations and meetings with stakeholders, and I met with patient advocacy groups. EOS BOS It is when we all work together that we will be able to see improvements in the health care system, and for everyone to recognize their responsibility. EOS BOS It is a shared responsibility and we will certainly do our part. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2003, the Ontario Liberal Party came to power, assuring Canadians and Ontarians that they would reduce debt “as conditions allow”.Since then, we have $300 billion in debt, which has doubled; $22,000 per person is owed, which has doubled. EOS BOS It has increased faster than any other province. EOS BOS Yesterday, the parliamentary secretary said that he would take no lessons from our successes, so I am wondering this. EOS BOS Is it because the Minister of Finance would rather be taking lessons from the disastrous legacies of Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty in racking up debt? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will take no lessons from the Conservatives when it comes to deficits. EOS BOS Our focus is on investing in the middle class and growing the economy. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect of us. EOS BOS After 10 years of weak economic growth, the worst possible reaction to an economic downturn would be to balance the budget at any cost. EOS BOS This is the kind of blind fixation Canadians rejected on October 19.Canadians expect us to deliver on growth and the economy, and that is exactly what we will do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, $9,000 did not buy much of a speech for our last question, but we will try again. EOS BOS The finance minister and another minister showed up in Toronto last week to re-announce no new money for housing for Toronto. EOS BOS No doubt the government's response to this is going to be about a Tory praising a Tory, but let me tell the House that it is fake praise in Toronto. EOS BOS Just yesterday, their Tory was in Ottawa talking to us all about what he needs for that city to get better. EOS BOS What they need is money for transit, money for infrastructure, and—guess what?—new money for housing. EOS BOS Celebrating the status quo means that only 60 units of housing are going to be built in Toronto next year. EOS BOS The waiting list now is 1,500 years for someone on the wait list. EOS BOS When will the government commit new money for housing? EOS BOS When will it build new housing with new money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were very pleased to be in the city of Toronto with the Minister of Finance and the mayor of Toronto to announce $86 million for our homelessness partners. EOS BOS What did Tim Richter, head of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, say? EOS BOS He said:The policy shift that the federal government announced in its budget this year is going to radically overhaul Canada’s response to homelessness. EOS BOS We will keep making these announcements, working together with our partners and working on evidence-based solutions to end homelessness. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to the Royal Bank of Canada, Canadians have less and less confidence in the current economy and thus they have less and less confidence in this government's policies. EOS BOS The Conservatives want to hit Canadians where it hurts: old age security. EOS BOS Meanwhile, they are giving away $3 billion in tax gifts—money that could be used to pay old age security benefits to 462,000 seniors. EOS BOS Rather than causing people anxiety, will the Conservatives finally answer our question? EOS BOS Will they or will they not increase the retirement age? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are ensuring that our old age security system is here for our current retirees and for future generations. EOS BOS It is very important to protect these benefits. EOS BOS That is why we have to act now to protect our future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the government's own actuarial tables tell him the Conservatives are wrong, that what they need to do is continue to reinforce the pension system, not take it away from Canadians. EOS BOS The Prime Minister made a promise to preserve OAS in 2005. EOS BOS At the time, he said that the Liberals had a hidden agenda to raise the retirement age. EOS BOS As the Conservative election leaflets said, “ EOS BOS There is no greater fraud than a promise not kept”.Why did the Prime Minister break his promise and why is he betraying Canadian seniors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the Prime Minister is doing is protecting our seniors and retirees by protecting and ensuring the viability of the old age security program. EOS BOS If we do nothing, as the opposition suggests, the cost of the old age security program will be too high for the number of workers who will make up the labour force and who will be paying taxes at that time. EOS BOS We must protect people, and that is what we are doing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in Guelph, in 2005, the Prime Minister was very explicit. EOS BOS When he was campaigning, he said:My government will fully preserve the Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, and the Canada Pension Plan and all projected future increases to these programs. EOS BOS Now it was also the same speech in which he promised solemnly that he would not tax income trusts. EOS BOS We know what happened to that promise. EOS BOS How can the Conservatives stand in their places today and pretend that the Prime Minister of Canada did not specifically promise to do exactly the opposite of what he said to the people of Switzerland in Davos? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there he is again on his high dudgeon, trying to hold himself out as some kind of an economic expert. EOS BOS Our government has started a reasonable debate on an issue that has very serious consequences for the future of our country and for seniors. EOS BOS We are talking about how to preserve and sustain old age security well into the future for the current seniors and those who may need this in the future. EOS BOS That is what is taking place here. EOS BOS Old age security will be unsustainable on the future path we are on. EOS BOS Many independent experts have said this. EOS BOS The Parliamentary Budget Officer is not— EOS
BOS The hon. member for Toronto Centre. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the Minister of National Defence is saying is exactly the opposite of what the Parliamentary Budget Officer said about the issue of sustainability. EOS BOS However, one question the government cannot avoid is in regards to its duplicity and that of the Conservative Party. EOS BOS We are talking about out-and-out duplicity. EOS BOS The Conservatives said the exact opposite during the election campaign. EOS BOS In an election campaign, the Conservatives are prepared to promise all sorts of things, and when they form a government, they follow the practice of the Reform Party. EOS BOS That is this government's true record, a record of reactions— EOS
BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of National Defence. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member is always in a chameleon position, depending upon the issue or the party of the day. EOS BOS We do know that ignoring this problem is a dangerous path to follow. EOS BOS Everyone agrees with this. EOS BOS In fact, when people look at an independent source, the director of the Rotman International Centre for Pension Management, they have to make changes. EOS BOS We cannot put our heads in the sand. EOS BOS Proposals should include looking at raising retirement age. EOS BOS The member opposite is burying his head in the sand when it comes to the economy, the same way he did when he was premier of Ontario. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development said the reason the Liberals have not delivered on their home care commitment is because of the provinces. EOS BOS Let me read their home care promise from Liberal.ca, because apparently that is where the real promises live. EOS BOS It states, “ EOS BOS As an immediate commitment, we will invest $3 billion”. EOS BOS It is 14 months later, and now it is the provinces' fault. EOS BOS When will the Liberals stop blaming others and finally come through on their commitment for home care? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our health care funding to the provinces will more than cover the rate of inflation and the GDP increase. EOS BOS We are offering to increase Canadian health transfers by nearly $1 billion a year, not to mention another $11.5 billion over the next 10 years specifically for home care and mental health. EOS BOS I think this will meet the needs of Canadians in the areas of mental health care and home care. EOS BOS This has the potential to transform Canada's health care system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals said they would do things differently. EOS BOS However, they broke their promises about respecting provincial jurisdiction in health care, an infrastructure program funded at 50%, the Aveos workers, medical assistance in dying, and reforming the electoral system, a promise broken by the Prime Minister now that the Liberals are in power. EOS BOS This is the same party leader who said he was fed up with politicians breaking their promises. EOS BOS Is that what real Liberal change looks like? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to my colleague from Montcalm EOS BOS .I can tell the House what we have accomplished. EOS BOS We have cut taxes for the middle class, introduced the Canada child benefit, and enhanced the Canada pension plan. EOS BOS Furthermore, we have made historic investments in infrastructure and in innovation, in measures to help seniors, and in the student loans and bursaries program. EOS BOS We kept all those promises. EOS BOS That is the Liberal government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2005, the Prime Minister said that anyone who abuses the public trust would go to prison. EOS BOS What is his story now? EOS BOS He says that everyone makes mistakes. EOS BOS Conservative favouritism is running rampant, whether we are talking about ACOA, the Senate or the employment insurance tribunal. EOS BOS It is not surprising that the Conservatives are spending a fortune on ads for programs that do not even exist. EOS BOS They want to sell the public on this illusion, since they have nothing meaningful to propose. EOS BOS That is what this government does. EOS BOS Why has breaking the rules become the norm with the Conservatives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has a responsibility to inform Canadians about the programs and benefits available to them. EOS BOS For example, this year, the government is implementing new measures to help Canadians, including the new Canada job grant, in order to help Canadians get training so they can find a job or find a better job. EOS BOS The government is promoting these measures because it wants Canadians to take advantage of them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last June, a 23-year-old Quebecker from Granby was killed in an accident while driving his GM vehicle. EOS BOS GM had been aware of the problems related to its faulty ignition switch since 2001, but the Minister of Transport says she was not made aware of the defect until February. EOS BOS Canadians should have been informed much sooner. EOS BOS Has the minister ordered GM to explain? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first of all, whenever there is a tragedy involved with respect to an accident, of course, we think of the victim's family, and we always want to make sure that we think of them first. EOS BOS Indeed, our top priority is the safety of Canadians. EOS BOS The way that the recall system on defects works is that it is the auto company that notifies Transport Canada of the defect and the intention for the recall. EOS BOS That happened in February of this year. EOS BOS The accident that the hon. EOS BOS member has indicated is actually under investigation by the Sûreté du Québec. EOS BOS As such, it is inappropriate to comment further. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there have been fatalities. EOS BOS Millions of cars have been recalled, and while the U.S. Congress has launched a full investigation, the minister is refusing to answer questions about a problem that has been going on for 13 years. EOS BOS GM is required to report these problems to Transport Canada as soon as they are identified, so why have Canadians been kept in the dark about this defect for so long? EOS BOS Who is keeping Canadians safe? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have already indicated, Transport Canada officials were notified of the defects and the recall by General Motors in February of this year. EOS BOS I am answering questions in the House on that topic right now. EOS BOS For the hon. EOS BOS member to say that I am not responding to questions, I do not know what fantasyland he is living in. EOS BOS Clearly, we have acted in accordance with the statutes when it comes to a recall, and we are grateful we are able to make sure that this is being done to protect Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on foreign investment and in so many other ways we just cannot trust the government. EOS BOS For instance, 3,000 families lost a breadwinner last month, 15% of young Canadians are now unemployed, nearly 40,000 Canadians gave up looking for work last month, and it has been 10 days since the Minister of Finance stood up to answer a question in the House of Commons. EOS BOS Last weekend we had ministers bragging about cuts in the Conservative budget that will put many more Canadians out of work. EOS BOS Maybe that is why the Minister of Finance is refusing to answer. EOS BOS Why will he not answer for his policies? EOS BOS Why will he not speak? EOS BOS Why will he not explain the job losses to Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if there is any explaining to be done in the House it would be by the NDP and that member for voting against every initiative that we have put forward to help Canadians, initiatives that have actually helped over 610,000 Canadians since July 2009. EOS BOS That is an important policy we put forward. EOS BOS We are actually working on a budget. EOS BOS I am not sure they understand the issues around a budget, but we are working on a budget and it will once again focus on jobs and the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, constituents from my riding have brought to my attention the latest propagandist newsletter issued by the radical Canadian Union of Postal Workers to its members. EOS BOS This radical political pamphlet outlines Fredericton local member Ruth Breen's trip to Israel using public funds, while at the same time accusing Canada of committing war crimes through its support for Israel. EOS BOS Could the minister responsible for Canada Post comment on CUPW's latest trip using public funds? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the member has raised is awful. EOS BOS Using public funds for radical political trips is wrong. EOS BOS CUPW should apologize for this misuse of public funds and its anti-Israel rhetoric. EOS BOS Will the Leader of the Opposition continue to support his big union bosses and their radical political views, or will he stand with taxpayers and demand an apology for the misuse of these public funds and to the state of Israel? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, before I ask the Thursday question I want to congratulate my colleague, the member for Victoria, for his new position as House leader for the NDP. EOS BOS I also want to thank the member for New Westminster— EOS BOS Burnaby for the work he has done over a number of years as opposition House leader for the NDP. EOS BOS I was only privileged to work with him for a short time. EOS BOS He had a reputation of being tough and a little difficult to work with, but I do not know how my colleague the new government House leader feels, but I felt he was fairly good to work with. EOS BOS We definitely will miss him, but we are looking forward to working with the member for Victoria as the new House leader. EOS BOS That said, I would ask the government to inform us what it will be doing for the rest of this week and into next week as well. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have to agree with the opposition House leader. EOS BOS It has been quite delightful to work together, and I hope we can continue the relationship we have created so we can be productive in this place for Canadians. EOS BOS [Translation]This afternoon we will continue debate on the Conservative motion. EOS BOS Tomorrow, we will begin second reading of Bill C-26 respecting the Canada pension plan. EOS BOS [English]We will call the bill on Monday and, hopefully, conclude debate on Tuesday. EOS BOS On Wednesday, we will commence debate on Bill C-25, the business framework legislation. EOS BOS Thursday shall be an allotted day. EOS BOS Finally, I would like to thank all hon. EOS BOS member for the progress on legislation so far this week. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our criminal justice system is so broken that one of Canada's most notorious serial killers is now volunteering at a school. EOS BOS As a father, I cannot imagine the horror of listening to my children come home and tell me that they just spent the day with Karla Homolka. EOS BOS It is sick. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister close the loophole that is allowing this to happen? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the system that is in place for doing vulnerable sector checks makes sure that employers and those who organize volunteers or who run schools and churches have access to information to make sure they make informed and prudent decisions. EOS BOS That is the system that is in place today, and it was in place similarly under the previous government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has always believed that western Canadian grain farmers deserve marketing freedom. EOS BOS We have always believed in property rights and that farmers deserve to determine how and when they will market their produce. EOS BOS Yesterday was third reading of Bill C-18, the marketing freedom for grain farmers act. EOS BOS Farmers want freedom. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources and for the Canadian Wheat Board please inform the House how our government is delivering on its promise to bring marketing freedom to western Canadian grain farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Yorkton— EOS BOS Melville for his great work on this issue. EOS BOS Yesterday history was made in the House when members of Parliament passed Bill C-18, the historic marketing freedom for grain farmers act. EOS BOS Once Bill C-18 receives royal assent, western Canadian grain farmers will be able to determine where and when and to whom they sell their grain. EOS BOS They will finally have the choice of a voluntary Canadian wheat board or the open market. EOS BOS Bill C-18 is now with the Senate. EOS BOS Senators know its swift passage will finally grant western Canadian grain farmers the marketing freedom they so richly deserve. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have known for years that the specifications for new fighter jets were written with F-35s in mind. EOS BOS The process was rigged from the start. EOS BOS Now we have learned that the F-35s do not even fulfill the requirements. EOS BOS This proves that the tendering process was rigged. EOS BOS Yet the Conservatives made it clear that they would brook no dissent. EOS BOS According to them, only the F-35s met the requirements. EOS BOS But that is not true. EOS BOS Why have they told the opposite of the truth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not at all true. EOS BOS It is clear that Canada needs to replace its existing fleet. EOS BOS That is why we have been partners in the F-35 program for the past 15 years. EOS BOS We plan to continue participating in the program, but we have not signed a contract. EOS BOS We have the flexibility we need to work with our budget to replace our aircraft. EOS BOS But the NDP has always been against necessary investment in the Canadian Forces, including in planes that our men and women in uniform need. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Conservatives are so confident that the F-35s meet the operational requirements, they should be willing to table the full list in the House today. EOS BOS Even when they are rigging the process, they cannot get a plane that meets Canada's needs. EOS BOS It is way over budget and they do not even have any guarantee of proper industrial benefits for Canada, one of the leading aerospace countries in the world. EOS BOS When are the Conservatives going to show some basic competence with public money and have an open, transparent, public competition to replace the CF-18s? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. EOS BOS If the NDP had its way, there would be no replacement for the CF-18. EOS BOS We do need a replacement for our men and women in uniform. EOS BOS As a country, as a responsible ally, we need a replacement for that fleet. EOS BOS We have pursued that for now 15 years under two different governments. EOS BOS There was a selection process. EOS BOS We have already outlined enormous industrial benefits right across Canada. EOS BOS Thousands of jobs will be created through this important acquisition. EOS BOS We do commit to doing this within budget, maintaining the flexibility that we require to achieve that objective. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's out-of-touch management has brought the RCMP to a crisis point. EOS BOS There was bullying of the provinces in contract negotiations, there were allegations of pervasive sexual harassment, and now there are questions about whether there are enough front-line officers to protect Canadians. EOS BOS The RCMP's annual budget has doubled over the last decade. EOS BOS RCMP headquarters is bursting at the seams. EOS BOS Why has the growth in front-line officers not kept pace? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I might remind the member that it was our government that hired 1,800 new front-line RCMP officers and provided $400 million to provinces to recruit officers. EOS BOS The former Liberal government took the irresponsible step of shutting down the RCMP depot in Regina. EOS BOS We are examining all government spending across the board, particularly in headquarters staff, to ensure taxpayers get the best value for their dollars, and the RCMP is no different in that respect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the lines prepared for the minister do not conceal the reality. EOS BOS The government's plan includes cuts to the RCMP. EOS BOS This has been confirmed by the Auditor General. EOS BOS The government's aggressive approach has already forced the RCMP to make cuts to investigations into organized crime, drug traffickers and white-collar criminals. EOS BOS The government's plan for the RCMP does not make sense. EOS BOS Why sacrifice the quality of police services in Canada? EOS BOS Why ask the RCMP to do more with less? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could repeat again that it was our government that hired 1,800 new front-line RCMP officers. EOS BOS We provided $400 million to provinces in terms of their responsibilities to hire and recruit officers; as I pointed out, it was the former Liberal government that shut down the RCMP training depot. EOS BOS When we came into office, we went from 300 officers a year in terms of training to 1,800 a year. EOS BOS We are committed to front-line policing. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the CRTC announced that it was lowering the Canadian-content quotas for television, knowing full well the impact that that regulation has on the entire television industry. EOS BOS This decision will undermine the creation of local programming. EOS BOS What is more, it shows the Conservatives' complete disregard for the new digital reality in the media. EOS BOS A report was already sounding the alarm on digital issues in 2011.Why did this government ignore the repeated testimony of the creators of our cultural sovereignty? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada's television, film, and digital media industry contributes nearly 125,000 jobs to the Canadian economy. EOS BOS That is why we proudly created the Canada media fund in 2009 to help with the creation of quality by Canadians for Canadians. EOS BOS Our government has worked tirelessly to better serve Canadians, bringing them better consumer choice in television while protecting Canadian jobs. EOS BOS We have always been clear: Canadians should not have to pay for the channels they do not want. EOS BOS They should get the ones they choose. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, that is irrelevant. EOS BOS I am sorry, but that is not what we are talking about. EOS BOS By reducing the space reserved for broadcasting Canadian content, the CRTC is making a dramatic change to the public policies that were put in place to support creation here in Canada. EOS BOS He is talking about jobs, but we are talking about culture. EOS BOS The result is that producers and creators are being put at risk. EOS BOS Our television programming will reflect who we are less and less. EOS BOS Is the minister aware that although talking about jobs for Canadians may be part of her role, her main priority should be to protect and promote the diversity of our cultural sovereignty here in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member is well aware of the rapidly changing media environment, to which no industry is immune in our country. EOS BOS We are carefully reviewing the decision, but to come back to the main point, we created the Canada media fund specifically to assist Canadians in the industry. EOS BOS When we look at the 125,000 jobs that come out of that industry, it is because they understand, they know, they create, and they produce, all with Canadian content, and it is for Canadians. EOS BOS We should let them make the decisions in terms of how we drive forward in the industry. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today's Statistics Canada report on jobs brought more bad news. EOS BOS There are now 23,000 fewer Canadians working full-time from September to October; 25,000 fewer manufacturing jobs today than a year ago when the Liberal Party took government; and 25,000 fewer young people are employed full-time as work has become more scarce and precarious. EOS BOS The Liberals promised deficits and jobs. EOS BOS We have the deficits, where are the jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said before, certainly the investments we are making are starting to show that kind of increase in jobs. EOS BOS Among young Canadians, we have seen an increase of about 26,000 jobs. EOS BOS What we know is that back in October 2015, Statistics Canada started publishing trend lines, and what we have seen over the last four months is job opportunities trending up in this country. EOS BOS The investments this government is making are starting to pay dividends. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, actually the PBO's report on jobs showed precisely the opposite, that Canada is performing below the trend line in every single area, and nowhere worse than with males. EOS BOS In fact, 70,000 fewer men are working full-time today than a year ago. EOS BOS The number of unemployed men is up to 7.1%. EOS BOS That means dads with nowhere to go in the morning and no paycheque to bring home at the end of the month. EOS BOS That is because of the big losses in energy and manufacturing sectors, two sectors that will be hardest hit by payroll and carbon taxes. EOS BOS Knowing that, will the government announce today its plans to cancel future tax increases on manufacturing and energy jobs in this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said to my hon. colleague, we have been making investments. EOS BOS In talking about growing the economy, I spoke with a number of men today from the construction sector, who like the investments we have been making in infrastructure. EOS BOS We are putting tradespeople back to work with the investments we are making in infrastructure. EOS BOS Having seen the downturn in commodity prices, they are happy that our government is making those targeted investments in infrastructure so we can get tradespeople back to work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, millions of Canadian workers will be forced to pay the Liberals' new tax on health and dental benefits. EOS BOS Many will lose their coverage and find themselves paying out of pocket for important expenses like life-saving medicines, mental health counselling, and their children's braces. EOS BOS It is not fair that the Prime Minister racks up billions of dollars in spending on his priorities and now Canadians have to pay for it with a $1,000 new tax on their health and dental benefits. EOS BOS Why would the Prime Minister even consider doing this? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we got elected on a commitment to invest in the middle class, to support the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS BOS The very first thing we did was lower taxes on the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS We are committed to protecting the middle class from increased taxes and that is why we will not be raising the taxes the member opposite proposes we will do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is good news for the middle class then, but what the middle class is struggling with— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. I know that members want to applaud the Leader of the Opposition, but we have to hear her question first. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Opposition. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what the middle class is worried about is being consistently overtaxed by the Prime Minister's spending. EOS BOS We now have a situation where young people looking to their future, people turning 18 today, will see higher taxes until they are 56 years old. EOS BOS Why would the Prime Minister continue down this path of massive deficits and massive debt, and burden the next generation? EOS </s> BOS We made a commitment, Mr. Speaker, to invest in young people, to invest in our future. EOS BOS That is why historic investments in infrastructure, whether it be public transit, whether it be green infrastructure, whether it be social infrastructure like housing and child care, these are things that are going to make our country better and stronger and create more opportunities for young people in the future. EOS BOS To add to the list of things that we are doing to help young people, the transforming, the strengthening of the Canada pension plan is going to leave young people better off down the line so they have money to retire, something the members opposite have always been against. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that this reckless spending will not stop. EOS BOS When we oppose a budget, it is because we are looking at the big picture. EOS BOS The government is forcing deficits on future generations. EOS BOS It talked about a $10 billion deficit during the campaign, but it will be higher. EOS BOS We heard him answer in English, but we are going to ask him the question in French. EOS BOS It will be interesting. EOS BOS We believe that, to cover these costs, the government will bring in a new tax on health and dental benefits. EOS BOS He just said something in English, but I would like to hear it again in French. EOS BOS Will there be a new tax on health and dental benefits? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as all members of the House know very well, we made a commitment to support the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS BOS We have lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS It was never our intention to raise taxes, as the member opposite suggested. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the community mailboxes being forced on communities are a disaster—and some might say a nightmare.Canada Post is not following through on its promises. EOS BOS These much-touted boxes are surrounded by garbage, covered in graffiti and are often not cleared of snow. EOS BOS That is not all. EOS BOS We can only imagine what will happen when these mailboxes are installed on Mount Royal, Beaubien or 9th Avenue. EOS BOS It will be an epic disaster. EOS BOS Unlike Canada Post, the commission on social development and Montreal diversity conducted public consultations. EOS BOS Surprise, surprise, it recommended that Canada Post immediately reverse this decision. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives finally listen to the public in Montreal and throughout Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is implementing a five-point plan to ensure that it remains self-sustaining going into the future. EOS BOS One aspect of that plan is the conversion of one million households to community mailboxes. EOS BOS However, in doing so, and I want to be very clear, Canada Post has the obligation to work with the municipalities to ensure that the siting is appropriate. EOS BOS I know that consultations are ongoing and I encourage Canada Post to continue on with that process. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the question of privilege that the Minister of Public Safety raised in the House yesterday. I will begin by saying that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons presented a well-researched, cogent argument in support of that. EOS BOS I do not think there is anything I can take issue with in regard to that presentation. EOS BOS However, I do have some concerns about the points that were made by the minister himself. EOS BOS With regard to the material that did come from the parliamentary secretary, it was quite clear that in each case, when one is looking at the question of privilege, the facts of the case must decide whether in fact privilege has been breached. EOS BOS I believe that is again true in this case. EOS BOS With regard to the points that the Minister of Public Safety made, he basically had three arguments supporting his position that his privilege had been breached. EOS BOS I will just do a quick summary. EOS BOS First was that parliamentary resources had been used to attack his position with regard to some incidents in his personal life and with regard to Bill C-30 that was the issue of contention, but it was more that parliamentary resources had been used in that regard that his argument was made. EOS BOS Second, he argued that the threats that were coming at him, and there can be no dispute over that part of it, that is very clearly a breach of his privilege and the privilege of any member of this House faced with those types of threats, that he either withdraw the bill or additional information would be released, is a clear breach of his privilege and one that would cause us to very strongly agree that his privilege had been breached on the facts of this case. EOS BOS His third point was on the opposition to Bill C-30, that the people who were opposed to it were clogging up his office. EOS BOS That is the part that most disturbed me. EOS BOS The position that we would be taking as a party is that that is not a valid argument in support of an argument for breach of privilege. EOS BOS In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I would draw to your attention a ruling by your predecessor, Mr. Milliken, on June 8, 2005. EOS BOS There was a similar type of situation where the member was claiming that his office was being intentionally clogged, that his email and phones were being intentionally clogged on an issue of some import to whoever was doing the work. EOS BOS The key point for Speaker Milliken was, I believe, the same as in this case. EOS BOS It is not the question of whether in fact that is occurring, although that is a factual matter that should be determined, the important point is whether it is the intent of the people who are trying to contact the minister or the member of Parliament to clog up his office and make it inoperable and impossible for other constituents to have access to the member of Parliament. EOS BOS The test is: What is the intent of the calls coming in, the emails coming in and the faxes coming in? EOS BOS Intent is the key component. EOS BOS With regard to this situation, it is quite clear that Bill C-30 is very contentious. EOS BOS We as an official opposition party have been adamantly opposed to it. EOS BOS The third party in the House is adamantly opposed to it. EOS BOS Lots and lots of Canadians are adamantly opposed to it. EOS BOS One of the ways of expressing that opposition is to attempt to contact the minister's office and tell him that this is a bad bill and give reasons for opposing it. EOS BOS If you make a ruling, Mr. Speaker, that says that if the effect of what one is doing in trying to contact the member of Parliament, in this case the minister, is to clog up his office, it will significantly impact the ability of individual Canadians to express their democratic voice in opposition to legislation. EOS BOS (1505)In this case, it is clear that the bill is so contentious that it is almost impossible to envision that that many calls, those many emails and faxes were coming in with the intent of clogging his office. EOS BOS The intent behind those was that Canadians were expressing their democratic right to oppose the bill. EOS BOS Canadians were telling the minister that they were opposed to the bill and they were giving their reasons. EOS BOS It is quite clear that relying on that ruling from Mr. Milliken, the Speaker of the day, would not be a basis on which to make a finding of breach of privilege in this case. EOS BOS The facts speak to that quite clearly. EOS BOS I want to repeat that we have no problem with the finding of breach of privilege because of the second point that the minister made with regard to the threats. EOS BOS That is not tolerable behaviour in our society, in this Parliament and in Canada as a whole. EOS BOS It is just not the way Parliament and our democracy function. EOS BOS Ministers and members of Parliament cannot be threatened in that way, so there is no question that there is a breach of privilege on that point. EOS BOS On the third point, with regard to clogging his office, that clearly is not a basis for a finding of breach of privilege. EOS BOS I would invite you, Mr. Speaker, to make it specific that that is not a basis on which you could make a finding of breach of privilege, as did Mr. Milliken in that particular case of June 5, 2008.The minister's first point is more problematic. EOS BOS He is arguing that the use of parliamentary resources to, as he put it, attack him surreptitiously, is more problematic. EOS BOS It is a grey area. EOS BOS The anonymity is the part that bothers me. EOS BOS If this had been done by one of my staff who had simply sent the minister a message using the resources that we have here on the Hill saying “ EOS BOS At a personal level, I'm opposed to the bill”, there is no question that is permissible because the individual is just doing his or her job. EOS BOS The grey area is the anonymity in the way this one was done. EOS BOS That one, Mr. Speaker, I will throw back into your lap and not make a suggestion. EOS BOS However, I do not think it is clear as to whether, because parliamentary resources are being used to communicate to a member of Parliament or to a minister, that automatically means a breach of privilege. I do not think that follows. EOS BOS It is the anonymity part of it that would be of concern. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to take the opportunity to say that we in the Liberal Party would also like to have the opportunity to comment on the question of privilege either tomorrow or on Thursday. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I only wish to add a comment to the comments made by the hon. EOS BOS member for Windsor—Tecumseh. EOS BOS I also deplore the use of private information as a tool of intimidation against any member of the House. EOS BOS That is a valid point of privilege. EOS BOS I appreciate the clarity with which my friend from Windsor—Tecumseh identified the reason that I felt discomfort yesterday as the hon. EOS BOS minister put forward a claim of privilege in relation to his office being swamped with calls. EOS BOS One hopes in a vibrant democracy that our offices are always swamped with calls, that our mailboxes are full, that petitions are sent and that Canadians rise up and speak clearly when they find that something we have done as their member of Parliament offends them. EOS BOS We must never think that it is a matter of privilege to stop the public from exercising its right to free speech. EOS </s> BOS I thank hon. members for their further contributions to the question currently before the Speaker. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder the Prime Minister wants to shut this place down on Fridays, cut off debate, and reduce the number of questions he faces. EOS BOS With all of his ethical scandals and bad government policy, the Prime Minister wants to avoid accountability at all costs. 
               Canadians elect us as MPs to make their lives better; they don't send us here to make the Prime Minister's life easier. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister stop his attack on accountability and transparency in this place and end his unilateral pursuit of making this House into his personal safe space? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government was elected on a campaign and a promise to Canadians to actually do better work in this place, for all members of Parliament to work better together. EOS BOS The discussion paper was exactly that: an opportunity for all members of Parliament to have a discussion, to have a conversation, to really be able to contribute to how we can work better in this place to do the important work that Canadians elected us to do. EOS BOS Yesterday was another example of a Prime Minister's question period when the opposition leaders, as well as private members, had an opportunity to ask the Prime Minister a question and receive an answer. EOS BOS That was in addition to other days that the Prime Minister is present. EOS BOS We believe we can do better in this place. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister can answer as many questions as he wants without ramming rule changes down the throats of members of Parliament. EOS BOS The changes being rammed down our throats by the Prime Minister diminish the voices of all Canadians in this place. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's new rules will reduce opportunities to debate, to ask questions, and to hold this government accountable to Canadians. EOS BOS Turning off the lights on Fridays does not serve the interests of Canadians; it serves the interests of the Prime Minister. EOS BOS When will he stop his arrogant push to make his life easier and abandon his attempts to reduce his own accountability and transparency in this House of Commons? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times before, I actually look forward to having conversations with members on both sides of the aisle on this important topic. EOS BOS It is in regard to our Standing Orders. EOS BOS It is in regard to modernizing the way the House of Commons works and bringing it into the 21st century. EOS BOS I believe that we should be able to have these important conversations. EOS BOS I believe we should be able to listen to different opinions that might not match our own so that we can have constructive conversations to improve the way this place works. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Remembrance Day is a time for all Canadians to remember the sacrifices of Canada's fallen. EOS BOS As parliamentarians, we are privileged to stand in the House regardless of political differences and represent the very democracy of Canada's veterans who fought and gave their lives for us. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Veterans Affairs comment on the importance of recognizing the services and sacrifices of Canada's veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member for Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, a former RCMP officer, is absolutely right. EOS BOS We as Canadian parliamentarians owe a tribute to our veterans because it is due to their sacrifice that we can stand for democracy in this very House. EOS BOS [Translation]On the weekend, I invite all parliamentarians to take the time to thank the veterans, reach out to them, lay a wreath and say thank you. EOS BOS Canada thanks you for the sacrifices you made for our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government's economic performance is in a constant state of disaster. EOS BOS It spends and spends and spends and has no economic growth to show for it. EOS BOS It says it is going to stimulate the economy, but what it is about to do will actually sedate the economy, not stimulate it. EOS BOS This is bad for future generations. EOS BOS What will this government do to create jobs for young Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today is a very important day. EOS BOS We heard this morning that first-quarter growth in 2017 was 3.7%. EOS BOS That is very good news. EOS BOS Our approach is working, and the unemployment rate is lower. EOS BOS I want to emphasize that the unemployment rate was 7.2% when our government came to power and is now 6.5%. EOS BOS That is a big change that means more than 250,000 full-time jobs. EOS BOS This is very good news for the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, shame, shame, shame. EOS BOS Future generations will have to pay interest on the Canadian debt of $25 billion every day. EOS BOS That is money that will not be spent on Canadian social programs, and it is going to get worse because the debt is going up. EOS BOS The government is trying to create wealth at the expense of future generations. EOS BOS This has to stop. EOS BOS When will the Minister of Finance understand that the best way to grow the economy is smaller government, more freedom, and more prosperity? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the facts matter. EOS BOS It is very clear that jobs are essential for young people. EOS BOS The 250,000 new full-time jobs are also very important to our country's future. EOS BOS That is the base on which we can build even stronger economic growth in the future. EOS BOS It is good now, and it will soon be even better. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he said “quite possibly”. EOS BOS Let us not leave anything out when quoting the ruling. EOS BOS Let us get back to the Senate expense scandal. EOS BOS According to Senator Tkachuk, Nigel Wright would “want to know things, like ‘When is [the report] going to be done?’” Mr. Tkachuk said he spoke to Mr. Wright about the political problem surrounding Mr. Duffy's expenses. EOS BOS Do the Conservatives think that the chair of the Senate Board of Internal Economy conducted or can still conduct an independent investigation into a scandal that he himself is mixed up in? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the chair of the committee said that the committee had consulted many people, including opposition members, in determining the results of this study. EOS BOS The discrepancies in the report reflect the repayment of Mr. Duffy's expenses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the Prime Minister and his cabinet plan to support the report on Mike Duffy even though everyone knows it has been whitewashed. EOS BOS Asking Senators Tkachuk and Stewart Olsen to go over the report is a joke. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has an ethical choice to make here and now: carry on with a corrupt process or support the open, transparent and legitimate disclosure of the facts. EOS BOS What choice is he going to make for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are choosing to toughen the Senate rules relating to senators' expense accounts. EOS BOS We have proposed 11 new rules, one of which would require senators to provide proof for every one of their expenses. EOS BOS The problem is that the Liberal leader in the Senate has already publicly stated that he will block those changes. EOS BOS I encourage the hon. EOS BOS member to ask his leader in the Senate to support these changes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Senate reports are supposed to be independent. EOS BOS The executive is not allowed, by law, to interfere, but both Senators Tkachuk and Stewart Olsen confirmed that they discussed the whole Duffy audit both with Nigel Wright and the Prime Minister directly. EOS BOS When did those discussions take place? EOS BOS Who in the Prime Minister's Office saw a copy of the draft Senate report? EOS BOS Has all of this information been provided to the RCMP, and when are we going to get an open, transparent, legitimate airing of the facts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the legitimate, open airing of the facts will come from the reviews of the House of Commons independent Ethics Commissioner and the Senate's independent Ethics Officer, both of whom are free to do their work and are separate from the government. EOS BOS The question for the Liberal Party is this: Why will the Liberals not tell their leader in the Senate to support the 11 tough new changes that we propose in order to ensure that abuses of Senate expense accounts are not repeated? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, with respect to the $90,000 payment to Mike Duffy, when did the Prime Minister find out about the cheque? EOS BOS To whom was it made payable? EOS BOS On which account was the cheque drawn? EOS BOS What was the date of the cheque, and will the government produce a copy of it?I ask all of this because the Prime Minister stated that Nigel Wright was acting in “ EOS BOS his capacity of chief of staff”, and that cheque therefore belongs to the Government of Canada, and Canadians have a right to see it. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives step up and produce it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is an explicit falsehood. EOS BOS The former chief of staff has indicated that he paid out of his personal resources the cost of Mr. Duffy's expenses and that it was a decision that he took sole responsibility for making. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there have been reports in the media that the government is making changes to the benefits provided to reservists in the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS Could the government tell us exactly what those changes are? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today's announcement is about respect for reservists. EOS BOS [Translation] With this announcement, part-time veteran reservists will receive the same minimum level of income as armed forces veterans through the earnings loss benefit. EOS BOS Our measures now comply with the recommendations made by the Veterans Ombudsman and the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. EOS BOS This new initiative is further evidence of our Conservative government's commitment to ensuring that our veterans and their families are treated with care, compassion and respect. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives' lack of transparency on spending reached a new low this week. EOS BOS When the media asked how much the Department of National Defence's HQ renovation would cost, the government responded by saying, “Go file an access to information request”.Now we find out that this paranoid government had the number of $623 million all along but would not release it to the public, so I ask the minister this question: what could possibly be the justification for keeping this number secret? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, in fact, the Department of National Defence and the public works department are collaborating to consolidate the workforce of national defence here in the nation's capital. EOS BOS We are moving forward with a plan to have those consolidated workforces go from 48 different buildings to 7 in the national capital. EOS BOS An independent third-party analysis has looked at this plan and has come back with the numbers. EOS BOS There will be a cost saving, a long-term ongoing savings, estimated at around $30 million a year. EOS BOS This is good news for taxpayers, and I know the member opposite will want to support it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we will deal with the issue of whether or not we are getting value for dollars afterwards, but right now I would like an answer to the question of why the government felt it was necessary to keep a number that it already had secret from the media, secret from the public and secret from this Parliament. EOS BOS What is the justification for the secrecy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his question, albeit in a rant. I will answer the question again. EOS BOS This is a good move for the Department of National Defence. EOS BOS It will see us consolidate our headquarters at the Nortel campus, which was purchased, I again repeat, to save money. EOS BOS This was done looking at the spending levels that were recorded. EOS BOS Where were they recorded? EOS BOS It was at a Senate hearing some nine months ago. EOS BOS Where were they recorded? EOS BOS I spoke about this in transcript at the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, of which the member opposite was a member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier in question period the Minister of Canadian Heritage claimed that habitual Liberal donor and now official languages commissioner nominee had never met with Katie Telford or Gerald Butts. EOS BOS On May 18, at the official languages committee, the hon. EOS BOS leader of the NDP asked, “ EOS BOS Who in the Liberal Party did you speak to about wanting to become a senator or commissioner?” EOS BOS Madam Meilleur said, “ EOS BOS I spoke to Gerald Butts.” EOS BOS Why did the Minister of Canadian Heritage call Madam Meilleur a liar? EOS </s> BOS I would like to set the record straight, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS I said that Mrs. Telford and Mr. Butts did not discuss the nomination of Madeleine Meilleur or her wanting to be the official languages commissioner, and that is an important fact. EOS BOS That being said, we have the right candidate. EOS BOS Her name is Madeleine Meilleur. EOS BOS Every single stakeholder in the official languages community knows that Mrs. Meilleur has been involved for 30 years in the promotion and protection of their rights. EOS BOS That is why we are very— EOS
BOS The hon. member for Chilliwack—Hope. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us try it again. EOS BOS On May 18, in the official languages committee, the hon. EOS BOS leader of the NDP asked, “ EOS BOS Who in the Liberal Party did you speak to about wanting to become a senator or commissioner?” Madam Meilleur, a Liberal donor and now the recommended official languages commissioner, said, “ EOS BOS I spoke to Gerald Butts. EOS BOS ” Why did the minister mislead the House? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Madeleine Meilleur has been involved for 30 years in the protection and promotion of official languages rights in the country. EOS BOS She was there at the beginning for the protection of the Montfort Hospital, which was going to be closed by the Conservative government in Ontario. EOS BOS That is exactly what she did, and then afterward, she started her political career—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Edmonton Manning and others will restrain themselves. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Opposition also will restrain himself. EOS BOS I know he has tried to get the same thing to happen. EOS BOS We do not want people to lose questions. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Canadian Heritage. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, she did public service for 30 years and has been involved in the protection and promotion of official languages. EOS BOS She went through the entire process. EOS BOS Many candidates also participated in the process, and ultimately, she was the best— EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Burnaby South. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today is international religious freedom day. EOS BOS Sadly, many people around the world do not enjoy religious freedom, and a large number have had their freedoms limited by their own government. EOS BOS Being a refugee because of one's faith is a reality that all too many people around the world face. EOS BOS Today, will the government commit to expediting the refugee applications of people who are being persecuted because of their faith, such as Christians in northern Iraq? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the fact that this government brought in 25,000 Syrian refugees over the space of four months. EOS BOS This has become praised around the world. EOS BOS In addition to that, as the member knows, all parties supported the motion recently to welcome Yazidis to Canada. EOS BOS Our government is working on that plan right now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it does not serve Canadian workers' interests when the Prime Minister keeps coming home empty-handed. EOS BOS That said, it is being reported that in response to concerns raised by a disabled veteran's wife, the then minister for veterans affairs told her that, in his view, the Liberals had no obligation to help her because it was her choice to marry her husband. EOS BOS This minister, in typical fashion, is now denying any responsibility and is blaming the widow for his comments. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us who he believes: the veteran's widow or this minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government takes the concerns of Canadians very seriously. EOS BOS We have been working over the past two years to deliver to veterans and their families the kinds of support they need and deserve and, quite frankly, they did not get for 10 years under the Conservative government. EOS BOS On this issue, the minister takes these allegations seriously and has responded to them and apologized. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, overnight, while Quebec Stevedoring was moving nickel concentrate in the port, the air quality in Limoilou deteriorated even more. EOS BOS Quebec's environment minister sounded the alarm, warning that children and seniors could be affected. EOS BOS This problem has been ongoing for two years and the government refuses to take action. EOS BOS The Prime Minister popped by Quebec City but did not make any announcements about addressing this problem. EOS BOS When will the Conservative government take the health of people in Quebec City seriously? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have discussed this matter with the Port of Quebec, and this is what I am told it has undertaken: a full review of the company's operation, installation of sensors in sensitive areas to ensure monitoring of dust emissions, fully operational sprinkler systems in transmission, and washing stations in order to ensure that vehicles returning are free of dust. EOS BOS The Port of Quebec is working with its tenants to ensure that the citizens of Quebec are actually protected from this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is one person in the House who knows something about conflict of interest and that is the Minister of Agriculture. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, in 2002 he was forced to resign as solicitor general because it was found that the government had funnelled money to the place in which his brother worked. EOS BOS At the time, it was ruled that he in fact was in breach of his obligations. EOS BOS I am wondering if the minister has learned from his past mistakes. EOS BOS Will he stand in the House and admit that his current chief of staff is in a complete conflict of interest? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my chief of staff is extremely qualified for the job. EOS BOS I am proud that she has such a strong agricultural background EOS BOS . I can assure my hon. EOS BOS colleagues in the House that from day one in my office she was subject to the Conflict of Interest Act, and she will also abide by any direction from the Ethics Commissioner. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating the Prime Minister, the government and all members who were elected. I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the Conservatives that 60% of Canadian voters did not vote for them. EOS BOS After the recent campaign, the Prime Minister said he felt an obligation to work with all members of the House. EOS BOS I agree with him on that, but the Conservatives' tone did not change at all in the throne speech. EOS BOS Where is the government's desire to work with others? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the new Leader of the Opposition. EOS BOS His party was very successful in the recent election, and we can see the results of that here today. EOS BOS In the throne speech, we repeated the promises we made to voters during the election. EOS BOS The result is clear: we now have a stable majority Conservative government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the election Canadians clearly voted for change and they clearly wanted members of Parliament to work together. EOS BOS That emotion and sentiment was very strong. EOS BOS They wanted a focus on their families and the issues that were affecting them each and every day. EOS BOS New Democrats have committed to work respectfully, to end heckling and to give this place the decorum that it deserves. EOS BOS Will the government commit today to do the same? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are, of course, looking forward to a mandate in which we can move forward constructively on the issues that we talked about with Canadians and to have in this House a debate that is meaningful, thoughtful and focused on policy and on the values of Canadians. EOS BOS I think we are going to have that in the years to come. EOS BOS It promises to be a very good, productive and constructive Parliament. EOS BOS I know that with our clear mandate, having laid out exactly what we would do to Canadians— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh!Hon. Peter Van Loan: —for Canadians, we certainly intend to carry through on those commitments and do exactly what we said we would do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Budge Officer has crunched the numbers and says that OAS is to sustainable. EOS BOS The National Pensioners and Senior Citizens Federation went to the HRSDC minister to make a case for better treatment of poor seniors. EOS BOS Instead it got “lecture that there is a sustainability crises in Old Age Security”. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives stop trying to scare people by pretending OAS is unsustainable and agree to leave OAS alone, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if we were to leave the OAS security system alone, there might not be an OAS security or an OAS system for future generations. EOS BOS It is very possible. EOS BOS Right now there are four workers paying taxes into general revenue for every retiree and OAS gets paid through general review. EOS BOS In the not too distant future, there will only be two taxpayers, two working people for every retiree. EOS BOS That is not sustainable. EOS BOS Our goal is to protect and preserve OAS for this generation and future generations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here they are threatening seniors with misinformation. EOS BOS In 2005, the Prime Minister said:My government will fully preserve the Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement, and the Canada Pension Plan and all projected future increases to these programs. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister break his promise to Canadians, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are keeping that promise. EOS BOS We have promised to protect the old age security system and CPP is well taken care of now. EOS BOS It is now time to take action to protect the old age security system for this generation and future ones. EOS BOS In fact, the member opposite who just posed the question, said:Action now is critical – we need a plan in place, we need the structures in place to deal with this dramatic shift in our country’s demographics. EOS BOS For once, she and I actually agree on something. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister cannot stop talking about taking action regarding the old age security program, but she refuses to provide any further information. EOS BOS In fact, all that we know about her plan is that she intends to make future generations pay for the Conservatives’ fiscal mismanagement. EOS BOS That is all that we know for the time being. EOS BOS The minister has said that we must listen to the experts. EOS BOS Perfect. EOS BOS Well, yesterday, an expert spoke. EOS BOS The Parliamentary Budget Officer found that the program is not under threat in the long term. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives give us a straight answer? EOS BOS Will the retirement age be increased from 65 to 67? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a number of experts have already told us that there will be a really serious problem, perhaps a crisis, in the old age security program if nothing is done. EOS BOS If nothing is done, there will not be enough money to keep the old age security program at its current level. EOS BOS We have heard the opinions of experts including Jack Mintz of the C. D. Howe Institute and a number of actuaries. EOS BOS I accept their opinions and I share them, and that is why we are taking action. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it really seems that the minister chooses her experts based on whatever suits her. EOS BOS The one thing I do know is that Canadian families are right to be afraid when it is obvious that this government is not even capable of answering a very simple question. EOS BOS I have received several emails from constituents in Pierrefonds—Dollard who have told me that had the Conservative government spoken publicly about making cuts to old age security, they would undoubtedly not be seated where they are today. EOS BOS Why not tell us clearly whether the Conservative government intends to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today's retirees are deserving of their benefits. EOS BOS That is why we want to ensure that future generations enjoy the same access to the system. EOS BOS Things need to be done now and tough decisions need to be made, of course, not only for today, but also for the future. EOS BOS People are counting on this system. EOS BOS That is why it is very important to safeguard the future of the old age security program. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government recognizes that strategic investments in public infrastructure play a key role in supporting dynamic communities while creating good jobs that help grow the middle class. EOS BOS Budget 2017 commits new funding for investment in public transit, water and waste water, culture and recreation, and rural infrastructure. EOS BOS These are all much-needed projects in Alberta. EOS BOS Can the minister tell the House how our government is supporting infrastructure investments across Alberta? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Edmonton Centre for his advocacy. EOS BOS Working in partnership with the Government of Alberta and Alberta municipalities, we have approved 128 projects with a combined investment of $4.2 billion. EOS BOS These projects include a waste water line in Lacombe, a project that should have been funded in 2012, and transit projects for St. Albert, Grande Prairie, Fort McMurray, and Red Deer. EOS BOS Some of these municipalities are receiving funding for the first time in a decade. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, access to reliable, broadband Internet service is very important in today's economy. EOS BOS It is important for every aspect of daily life. EOS BOS However, many regions in our country, especially our rural and remote regions, are still lacking good Internet connections. EOS BOS Even my riding, Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, does not have the necessary infrastructure to support broadband Internet service. EOS BOS That is why I was pleased with our government's announcement regarding the connect to innovate program, which will help resolve this problem. EOS BOS Can our Prime Minister provide the House with an update on this important matter for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Chicoutimi— EOS BOS Le Fjord for his question and his passion for his beautiful region. EOS BOS Internet access is an essential part of daily life. EOS BOS With connect to innovate, we are investing up to $500 million to bring Internet access to 300 rural communities. EOS BOS I was in Roberval to announce $13 million for high-speed Internet for every region in Saguenay— EOS BOS Lac-Saint-Jean and the Mauricie. EOS BOS These are necessary investments for improving the lives of Canadians and giving them more opportunities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the election, the Prime Minister promised British Columbians that Kinder Morgan would have to undergo a new environmental review, but that was then. EOS BOS Since, two hand-picked ministerial panels have shown the process is truly broken. EOS BOS Now, after getting votes from B.C., the Prime Minister says that Harper's review process is just fine, thanks very much, and the project must go forward as it is. EOS BOS Why did the Liberals betray British Columbians, break their election promise, and approve the Kinder Morgan pipeline? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government approved the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline because we believe it is in the interests of Canada. EOS BOS It is in the interests of Canada because it will open up Alberta crude to export markets. EOS BOS The member probably knows that 99% of our exports now go to the United States. EOS BOS Perhaps he would agree that expanding that market is a good idea. EOS BOS Perhaps he would also agree that 15,000 jobs is in the interests of British Columbians, Albertans, and all Canadians. EOS BOS If he cannot believe me, maybe he should talk to Rachel Notley. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, more and more experts are criticizing the Liberals' ridiculous decision to buy 18 outdated Super Hornets. EOS BOS Thirteen generals, all former Royal Canadian Air Force commanders, have condemned this “ill-advised, costly, and unnecessary” decision. EOS BOS They say the Liberals will be burdening the Royal Canadian Air Force for decades to come to the point where it will be doing less with more. EOS BOS That makes no sense. EOS BOS The generals even suggested a solution that would increase the number of jets for a fraction of the price. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals so bent on buying Super Hornets at $300 million apiece? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to making sure that our men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces, especially our air force, have the right aircraft. EOS BOS We as a government have committed to replacing the fighters, hence the reason we are actually committed to an open competition to replace the entire fleet. EOS BOS We are investing into the legacy fleet as well. EOS BOS Plus, we are buying new Super Hornets. EOS BOS The discussions are ongoing on that to make sure that we can fill this capability gap. EOS BOS I do not know why the member opposite has a concern with investing in defence. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the current commander of the air force says there is no capability gap, and now 13 former commanders of the air force are demanding the Prime Minister put an end to his “ill-advised, costly, and unnecessary”  sole-source purchase of 18 Super Hornets. EOS BOS The generals say that the Prime Minister's partisan decision will damage the nation's defence posture. EOS BOS They have even offered alternative strategies based upon their air force experience that would be more beneficial to Canadian industry, Canadian taxpayers, and our national security. EOS BOS The experts have spoken. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals not listening? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank those former generals for their service. EOS BOS The chief of the defence staff, General Vance, has exceptional experience and I have an air force commander with exceptional experience as well. EOS BOS I read that letter. EOS BOS No, we will not be buying used aircraft for our air force. EOS BOS We will be buying new equipment for our air force, making sure that we replace all the fighters, and making sure that we actually fill the interim capability gap and invest in the legacy fleet. EOS BOS We will be investing in defence. EOS BOS That is what our government committed to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to spending sprees, the sky is the limit for the Liberals except when it comes to honouring the memory of Canadians who served their country in the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS We have learned that more than 70 military museums across the country will receive no more funding. EOS BOS How very generous of the Liberals to cut them off as we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation. EOS BOS As a former serviceman, I find this lack of respect deeply troubling. EOS BOS Why did the minister, who is also a veteran, agree to this drastic cut? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for raising this concern with me. I will take a look at it and get back to him. EOS BOS However, as both my critics know, my office and I are always open to any questions EOS BOS . I will look into this and get back to the member. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government never misses an opportunity to rip money out of the pockets of hard-working Canadians. EOS BOS For decades Canadian farmers have been able to defer cash grain income from one year to the next. EOS BOS Now the Liberals want to take that away without proper consultation, and apparently without even knowing what they are doing. EOS BOS This bad decision will affect farmers from across the country. EOS BOS Why is it that the only new agricultural initiative in budget 2017 is a Liberal rip-off of hard-working Canadian farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am always honoured to stand in this House and talk about the good work that our government is doing. EOS BOS Our government strongly supports the Canadian grain industry, which is a key driver of exports, jobs, and economic growth. EOS BOS With changes in recent years in grain marketing, the delivery of listed grains is now the responsibility of the private sector instead of the federal government. EOS BOS Budget 2017 launches consultations with farmers and stakeholders on this tax deferral, and we want to hear from farmers before moving forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister said that the Liberals would “do justice to caregivers”, and today we learned what that meant. EOS BOS The Liberals are cutting 8,000 spots available this year via the caregiver immigration stream. EOS BOS This program provides vital support for families that are looking after loved ones with physical or mental disabilities. EOS BOS These changes leave the most vulnerable Canadians without care. EOS BOS Why have the Liberals chosen to cut 27% of the immigration spots available to caregivers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in respect to caregivers, the House and the government stands behind the significant contribution that caregivers make to Canadian society. EOS BOS We stand by our campaign commitment, which is to eliminate the LMIA fee of $1,000 that is required to hire a caregiver. EOS BOS We also stand behind our commitment to work with provinces and territories to facilitate the work and the hiring of caregivers. EOS BOS Caregivers represent a significant contribution to our country. EOS BOS We recognize that and we are working on processing their claims expeditiously. EOS
BOS Therefore, Mr. Speaker, recognizing a contribution means an 8,000 person cut. EOS BOS The government has also cut the numbers of spots available under the federal skilled worker in Canada experience class by 21%. EOS BOS These cuts to economic immigration come at a time when our workforce is aging, our economy is slowing and refugees are waiting for months to have long-term affordable housing. EOS BOS In this context, could the minister explain how he plans to provide the services needed to ensure that the government's planned 250% increase in refugees is successful, and how much this will cost? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in terms of our specifics that were announced today, let me elaborate on the plan. EOS BOS It considers the economic needs of our country and it considers the pressing need for family reunification and our humanitarian tradition, which are important vis-a-vis refugees and people coming in under the agency category. EOS BOS With respect to the economic needs of the country, we hear these needs loud and clear. EOS BOS We are responding to them. EOS BOS The levels that we have announced are over 50% of the overall targets of immigrants that we are bringing to our country. EOS BOS That is responsive to Canadian industry, to Canadian business and to making the country prosper and grow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, seasonal monsoon rains continue in Sri Lanka and the country is facing the worst natural disaster since the 2004 tsunami. EOS BOS Death toll estimates are now in excess of 200 with many more missing and injured. EOS BOS International aid is required to support the victims. EOS BOS Could the Minister of International Development inform the House of the steps being taken by the Government of Canada to help in the response? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned with the ongoing flooding in Sri Lanka and our thoughts are with those affected. I can already announce an initial envelope of up to $250,000 to respond to the humanitarian impacts of the flood. EOS BOS Obviously, we remain in close contact with our humanitarian partners. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the economic downturn has hit Alberta workers hard. EOS BOS Despite losing their jobs, through no fault of their own, laid off Albertans are at a disadvantage compared to other Canadians. EOS BOS They work longer to qualify for EI and then receive fewer benefits. EOS BOS Alberta's Premier Notley and Edmonton's Mayor Iveson are asking the Liberal government to address EI. EOS BOS Albertans appreciate the stabilization grant, but they also deserve fair access to worker benefits. EOS BOS Will the government act now, today, to assist Alberta families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are aware of the serious situation facing those workers in Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan, and different parts of the country. EOS BOS We are working hard to reform EI, which has been neglected and does not serve any Canadian, basically. EOS BOS More importantly, we want to ensure that Albertans and those who have been hit by the commodity crisis are dealt with fairly and honourably as soon as possible, and that is what we are working on at this time. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my region also needs help. EOS BOS Workers at a car dealership are struggling to make ends meet after three years of being locked out, and seasonal workers cannot figure out how to survive between seasons. EOS BOS The Liberals were highly critical of the EI reform when they were in opposition. EOS BOS Now that they are in power, all we get from them are meaningless answers. EOS BOS Will the minister promise to no longer dip into the EI fund and finally help our workers who need help now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yes, we are interested in hearing from Canadians on the best way to approach changes in EI. EOS BOS We are going from coast to coast to coast, listening to our own House of Commons committee, women, indigenous people, working Canadians, to find a solution that meets our needs as Canadians that are on the job. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Thunder Bay's acute care hospital has been in gridlock for years. EOS BOS On January 26, the hospital designed for 375 acute care beds had 469 patients stacked up in public hallways. EOS BOS Tommy Douglas worked with the Liberals to create a world-leading system funded 50% by the feds. EOS BOS The feds' share now is less than half of that. EOS BOS Do the Conservatives have a plan to restore and renew our health care system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is an absolutely absurd statement. EOS BOS We have the highest recorded health care transfer dollars right now in history. EOS BOS Since forming government, transfers to the provinces have gone up by 70% and will reach $40 billion annually. EOS BOS We have committed to increasing transfers year after year. EOS BOS I am very proud of our government's record on transfers, unlike the Liberals who, for many years, balanced their budget on the backs of the provinces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been clear that supporting Canadian families is a priority for our government. EOS BOS Today the Minister of Health met with families and community groups to outline actions that we are taking to support Canadian families in terms of food, drugs and consumer safety products. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Health please inform this House of the steps our government is taking to protect the health and safety of Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for that great question. EOS BOS As the Minister of Health and as a mother, I am proud to outline areas where our government will take concrete actions in the months ahead. EOS BOS For example, we are moving toward more plain language on drug labels, taking action on products that contain small powerful magnets that threaten children's safety, improving adverse drug reaction reporting and proposing enhanced safety standards for playpens. EOS BOS Our government is taking action to support the health and safety of Canadians and their families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, incredibly, it was 17 months ago that the Auditor General alerted the Minister of Health to the problems with drug safety. EOS BOS It has taken that long to get any action. EOS BOS Now we have over 1,000 patients in Ontario and New Brunswick who have received diluted chemotherapy drugs from a company operating in a legal loophole. EOS BOS Incredibly, Marchese Hospital Solutions has no provincial or federal oversight, and its products were never inspected. EOS BOS Surely this cannot be allowed to go on, putting the patients' health at risk. EOS BOS Why is this minister not taking immediate action to ensure a safe supply of chemotherapy drugs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families who have been affected by this situation. EOS BOS I have written to the Ontario health minister to voice my concerns. EOS BOS I have also instructed Health Canada officials to co-operate fully with the investigation which the Wynne government is leading. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, prayers will not raise the dead. EOS BOS We want to know what the minister is doing to protect Canadians' health. EOS BOS We want to know how, in consultation with the provinces, she is ensuring that pharmaceutical companies take responsibility for their actions. EOS BOS More than 1,000 cancer patients in New Brunswick and Ontario received incorrect chemotherapy doses. EOS BOS We need to find a solution now so that this does not happen again. EOS BOS What is the minister's plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the issue of patient care in hospitals, the practice of pharmacy and admixing all fall under provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS I have written to the Ontario health minister to express my concerns. EOS BOS I have also instructed Health Canada officials to co-operate fully in the investigation. EOS BOS If the review determines that there is a federal role, we will seriously consider any changes that are recommended to prevent this from happening again. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us continue to talk about people's health. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport claims that ports are not his responsibility, that the Port of Québec is independent and that people are appointed to the board of directors to take care of the port. EOS BOS I would like to tell the minister something. EOS BOS While the Port of Québec directors, who were appointed by the Conservatives, are watching nickel dust fall on Limoilou and Lévis, the health of the people in these communities is being affected. EOS BOS Incidentally, does the hon. EOS BOS member for Lévis—Bellechasse, like the minister, also not care that people are breathing in high concentrations of nickel? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on March 27, the public health authority for the Quebec City area issued a press release signed by Dr. François Desbiens, which indicated that the situation did not pose a public health threat requiring immediate action. EOS BOS People need to understand that the hon. EOS BOS member is making interpretations and wants to judge the whole matter. EOS BOS The Port of Québec must manage the Port of Québec. EOS BOS A board of directors is in place, and the Port of Québec responded to this situation yesterday. EOS BOS Although the Port of Québec continues its investigation, as of right now, we are committing, for the benefit of the public and all the stakeholders involved, to ensure that the tenant in question—because we are talking about a tenant here—will put the necessary measures in place. EOS BOS It is already done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a big difference between being unable to do something and not wanting to do it. EOS BOS By law, the Port of Québec is part of the Canada Port Authorities, which fall under Transport Canada. EOS BOS Therefore, although a board of directors manages the port's day-to-day operations, the minister is still politically responsible for the current nickel dust situation and its potential effects. EOS BOS He is responsible here and now in the House. EOS BOS The question is simple. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us what he intends to do to resolve this crisis and reassure the people of Limoilou? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course we have been in contact with the Port of Québec administration many times. EOS BOS However, unlike the NDP, we are not going to try to take over the management of the port's day-to-day operations when there are people in place to do that work. EOS BOS We know that the NDP wants to manage everything from Ottawa and wants to centralize everything. EOS BOS We respect the boards of directors that are in place. EOS BOS We are ensuring that all the work is done. EOS BOS As I said, as of yesterday and even as far back as November, the Port of Québec has been helping to deal with this matter. EOS BOS We hope, for the public's sake, that the problem will be resolved quickly. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are letting tax cheats of the hook and are doing nothing to help middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS The media report that a single bank, the HSBC, has helped as many as 1,800 Canadians avoid paying their taxes. EOS BOS However, while the Swiss and American authorities are going after HSBC for money laundering and fraud, the current Conservative government does nothing but make excuses. EOS BOS Billions of dollars are being lost every year to tax-evasion schemes, while the current government guts the Canada Revenue Agency. EOS BOS When will the minister start really going after tax cheats? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government has zero tolerance for tax evasion. EOS BOS Since 2006, the CRA has audited over 8,600 international tax cases, identified over $5.6 billion in additional taxes being collected, and we have not reduced our audit forces. EOS BOS Regarding HSBC, the CRA has conducted hundreds of audits, leading to over $21 million in taxes and penalties being reassessed. EOS BOS Further, CRA has received over 250 voluntary disclosures relating to Canadians with an HSBC account. EOS BOS That represents another $123 million. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the HSBC Bank in embroiled in a huge scandal involving tax fraud and money laundering linked to drug trafficking and the financing of terrorism. EOS BOS Some 1,800 Canadian clients had accounts with that Swiss bank. EOS BOS Often it was unscrupulous institutions here that facilitated the transfer of funds, allowing people to hide money with HSBC.Now that we know that Swiss authorities began conducting searches today, can the minister tell us what she is doing to catch white collar fraudsters and crack down on their accomplices? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to tax evasion. EOS BOS [English]As I have stated with respect to the HSBC accounts, when non-compliance was expected, the CRA conducted hundreds of audits. EOS BOS This has led to over $21 million in taxes and penalties being reassessed. EOS BOS Further, our voluntary disclosure program, which is more robust than ever when it comes to international tax evasion, has brought forward 250 voluntary disclosures representing another nearly $123 million in previously undisclosed amounts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians pay among the highest prices in the OECD for prescription drugs, leaving one in ten Canadians unable to fill prescriptions. EOS BOS Doctors, nurses, pharmacists, health experts, and seniors organizations have all called for the creation of a national drug plan to make prescription drugs more affordable. EOS BOS The provinces have said they are willing to talk, but the federal government will not even come to the table. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives showing such a shameful lack of leadership in addressing the high cost of drugs for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have repeatedly said to Canadians and to my provincial counterparts that they are getting ripped off when it comes to the cost of drugs. EOS BOS They negotiate their plans separately instead of together, and I continuously encourage them to get together and invite us to the table to look at a national drug purchasing plan, including, and foremost, to talk about bulk purchasing.
              We can save Canadians billions of dollars if we do this together, and I am at the table with them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Treasury Board contracting rules are in place to prevent corruption and political favouritism. EOS BOS Yet documents show that in March 2013, the office of the then minister of natural resources, now the Minister of Finance, ordered his department to approve a $9,200 payment that, according to his own department, “ EOS BOS contravenes... EOS BOS Treasury Board...Contracting Policies”.This was an after-the-fact speech-writing contract for the minister. EOS BOS Who was the money for? EOS BOS It was for none other than Guy Giorno, the Prime Minister's former chief of staff. EOS BOS Why were proper contracting rules violated? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we expect all Treasury Board guidelines to be followed. EOS BOS Having said that, we know that the Liberal Party still has some $40 million of taxpayer funds outstanding. EOS BOS Now that there is a new member over there, I wonder if she might help them search for that $40 million, maybe give them a bit of a leg up. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, government documents make it clear that this procurement was “ EOS BOS inappropriately actioned”. EOS BOS The amount charged was conveniently just under the $10,000 public disclosure limit, but what is really distressing is that the department has no copy of the speech or any record of whether or where it was actually delivered. EOS BOS Can the minister immediately produce a copy of this speech, and can he advise why taxpayers paid for it if the department has no record of its very existence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, of course we expect all Treasury Board guidelines to be followed. EOS BOS When it comes to giving speeches and being paid for those speeches, I suggest that the member actually ask the leader who sits in front of him, who we know accepted huge contracts, while being a member of Parliament, to speak at places like school boards, unions, and churches. EOS BOS We are going to focus on what matters to Canadians: safety and security and the economy. EOS BOS Our plan has created over 1.2 million jobs. EOS BOS We are getting people back to work. EOS BOS We are cutting taxes. EOS BOS We are investing in infrastructure. EOS BOS We are going to continue to do that for a very long time to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Treasury Board rules were broken in order to give an after-the-fact contract to the Prime Minister's former chief of staff. EOS BOS The office of the then minister of natural resources even insisted that the payment be made in the fiscal year-end panic. EOS BOS Even worse, the department cannot find a copy of the discussion and does not even know what it is about. EOS BOS How can the minister find this to be acceptable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me just get this straight. EOS BOS It is 2:45. EOS BOS We are a number of months ahead of an election, and the best the Liberals have is they want to see a copy of a great speech, apparently, that the Minister of Natural Resources gave. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about cutting taxes. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the fact that we are giving parents, every single family in this country, more money in their pockets. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the massive infrastructure program the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs has brought forward. EOS BOS They do not want to talk about the mission we are taking right now in Iraq. EOS BOS The best they have is “ EOS BOS Can you please send us a copy of a speech that was given by the Minister of Natural Resources?” I will take a look, and I will see what other great speeches he has delivered. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during yesterday's debate on the carbon tax cover-up, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance offered a truly fascinating explanation as to why they needed to black out the cost of the carbon tax. EOS BOS She said that the memo's release would “cause confusion for Canadians”. EOS BOS I guess Liberal studies have shown that an overdose of transparency can lead to chronic cases of confusion. EOS BOS Liberals are protecting Canadians from the sticker shock they will experience if they find out what this tax will actually cost them. EOS BOS Will the government end the carbon tax cover-up, clear up the real confusion, and release the true costs of this tax to Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the only confusion appears to be that the member opposite and the party opposite do not understand that we need to take action to tackle climate change, that polluting should not be free. EOS BOS We know that we need to put a price on pollution, because that means we will pollute less, actually innovate, develop clean technologies, grow our future, and ensure a more sustainable world for our children and grandchildren. EOS
BOS Still on the carbon tax cover-up, Mr. Speaker, today we learned that in January inflation was a third higher than expected. EOS BOS Bloomberg reported that the inflation growth was caused by “rising gasoline prices and new carbon levies”. EOS BOS This supports Finance documents, which earlier said that Liberal carbon taxes would cascade throughout the economy in the form of higher prices on consumers, families, and businesses, but how much those costs would be are blacked out by the Liberals. EOS BOS Now that Canadians are paying more, will the government finally end the carbon tax cover-up? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite were really concerned about hard-working Canadians, he wouldn't have opposed the increase in the Canada pension plan, lowering old age security to 65, increasing the guaranteed income supplement for seniors, and ensuring that Canadian families get more through the Canada child benefit. EOS BOS We understand that we need to support middle-class Canadians, and they also elected us to take action on climate change so that we can grow our economy and ensure a sustainable future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the interest of transparency, the chair of the transport committee has announced that the budget date will be March 21. EOS BOS Bloomberg lists the budget options as “tax, borrow, or wait”. EOS BOS Paul Wells said, “ EOS BOS A funny thing happened on the way to [the Prime Minister]’s new world of justice for the middle class: the federal government ran out of money”. EOS BOS As Margaret Thatcher would have said, the Liberals are running out of other people's money. EOS BOS Will the finance minister finally put his head up before he runs straight on into the brick wall of reality? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are looking forward to budget 2017. EOS BOS What it will be is a continuation of our efforts to help middle-class Canadians, a continuation of our efforts to ensure that we actually grow our economy. EOS BOS The reason we chose investment over austerity was because we knew that after a decade of meagre growth, the lowest growth for eight decades, it was time to make investments in the future of our country. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing. EOS BOS We are ensuring that children today, the people seeking jobs today, have those sorts of opportunities tomorrow. EOS BOS That is why our initiatives have created exceptional job growth, and we are looking forward to that continuing with our new budget measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, because of the Conservatives' fiasco with the appointment of Justice Nadon—and by the way, this has never happened in 138 years— EOS BOS Quebec will be under-represented on the Supreme Court of Canada for up to five years. EOS BOS Only eight justices can currently hear cases. EOS BOS It is incredible. EOS BOS Furthermore, the court must rule on a number of important and complex cases, including the Senate case. EOS BOS What will the Minister of Justice do to ensure that Quebec has full representation on the Supreme Court of Canada as soon as possible? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will continue to appoint Supreme Court of Canada justices on the basis of merit and regional representation. EOS BOS Obviously, we would prefer to have a full bench at the Supreme Court of Canada. EOS BOS However, given the quality of the justices, I am sure they will properly carry out their obligations and responsibilities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, an important vote is missing. EOS BOS Three seats were set aside for Quebec and, at present, only two are occupied. EOS BOS [English]The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court in the land. EOS BOS It should be a source of unity for all Canadians, not a source of conflict and division. EOS BOS What is the minister going to do to resolve the issues surrounding Justice Nadon's appointment and ensure that such a situation never repeats itself? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will continue appointing judges to the Supreme Court of Canada based on merit and regional representation. EOS BOS In this case, obviously, it would be ideal to have the full panel of the court, but with the quality and depth of the judges that are presently on the bench, they will certainly be able to very ably meet their responsibilities and commitments. EOS
BOS I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of the Honourable Clarice Modeste-Curwen, Minister of Tourism & Civil Aviation of Grenada. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of the Honourable Volda Ann Lawrence, Minister of Social Protection of the Republic of Guyana. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had the honour of debating my bill to harmonize Canada's laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the Conservatives immediately refused to seize this historic opportunity for real reconciliation. EOS BOS My question for the minister is very simple: does he share the opinion of his parliamentary secretary, who insinuated that the rights of indigenous people are incompatible with the rights of other Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first of all, I must correct the member. EOS BOS The parliamentary secretary did not say that. EOS BOS He simply said that the hon. member's bill would give a group of Canadians, in this case aboriginal Canadians, a veto over the will of Parliament. EOS BOS That flies in the face of the Canadian Constitution, which is why we will not be supporting his bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Finance made a statement that was surprising, to say the least. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS Clearly, the members from the other side [that means us] are still stuck in this whole balanced budget thing. EOS BOS ” I can assure this House that, yes, we are and we will always be stuck on having a balanced budget. EOS BOS That is the responsible thing to do. EOS BOS What is also clear is that the minister is stuck on running up deficits one after the other. EOS BOS Will the minister change his ways and finally admit that it is detrimental to Canada's future to have such deficits? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our priority is to invest. EOS BOS Six months ago, Canadians chose optimism, not pessimism. EOS BOS Canadians chose to make investments that will grow the economy, not to have a balanced budget at any cost. EOS BOS We will make choices that are good for Canadians and that will grow the Canadian economy, now and in the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's approach is irresponsible. EOS BOS It is obvious that the Minister of Finance has completely lost control of public spending. EOS BOS Running up a $30-billion deficit, with more to come, is irresponsible to today's society and especially to our children and grandchildren, who are going to pay for this government's excesses. EOS BOS When will the government finally get in touch with reality and stop putting our grandchildren into debt? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about children in Canada. EOS BOS Thanks to our measures, their situation will improve now and in the future. EOS BOS We introduced the Canada child benefit, which will help nine out of 10 families with children by giving them an additional $2,300 a year. EOS BOS Today's children will have a better future because we are making investments today for them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have asked the Prime Minister before about the appointments of the next Ethics Commissioner and Commissioner of Lobbying. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is running out of time to consult with the opposition parties. EOS BOS He is legally required to consult with the opposition, but we all know what he thinks about following the law. EOS BOS Since the Prime Minister will not recuse himself from selecting the next lobbying and ethics commissioners, will he tell the House when he will consult with the opposition parties on these appointments? EOS </s> BOS On the contrary, Mr. Speaker, I have recused myself from the appointment of the next Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he has recused himself by appointing his House leader, who reports to him, on who should be appointed as the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS It sounds a little mischievous to me. EOS BOS We know the Prime Minister is currently being investigated by the Ethics Commissioner for breaking the law. EOS BOS He is failing to uphold any level of ethical standards and refuses to even acknowledge if he has met with the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS The commissioner's term is set to end this July, and the Prime Minister has not even consulted the opposition about a viable replacement. EOS BOS Is it the Prime Minister's plan to send the Ethics Commissioner packing without appointing a replacement so he can just walk off scot-free? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all members in this House understand how important it is to have a strong Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS I myself have worked many times with and have answered many questions from, over the course of my career as an MP, the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS I know that all of us in this House will always work with her, because that is part of the trust Canadians need to have in their members of Parliament and in their government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner position will soon be vacant, and we do not know if the Prime Minister really intends to launch a clear and transparent process to fill the position or if he is just going to pick a name from the list of Liberal donors. EOS BOS Transferring appointment responsibilities to the government House leader's office is anything but reassuring. EOS BOS Do we need to bat our eyelashes at the Prime Minister for him to consider consulting the opposition parties, or will he have the decency to consult us in the interest of transparency, even at the risk of offending generous Liberal donors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government's appointments reflect the outstanding merit and diversity of candidates from across the country. EOS BOS Over 60% of our appointees are women, 15% are visible minorities, and 10% are of indigenous descent. EOS BOS We have proven that this is a merit-based appointment process. EOS BOS We will always comply with the rules of the process, including the rule about consulting opposition members. EOS BOS We believe that appointing the right people is crucial to maintaining Canadians' faith in our parliamentary institutions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he forgot 100% Liberal. EOS BOS We see an epidemic of partisan Liberal appointments happening. EOS BOS Jennifer Stebbing, a failed Liberal candidate, got a cushy Hamilton Port Authority job. EOS BOS Johnna Kubik was appointed as a judge after donating over 26 times to the Liberal Party. EOS BOS The new president of ACOA got his appointment for over $30,000 in Liberal donations. EOS BOS Now, after a nice $1,500 donation to the Liberal Party, the infrastructure minister appointed Jeanhy Shim to the Waterfront Toronto board of directors. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister stop this blatant partisan patronage and start serving all Canadians rather than just the Liberal insiders? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we believe, on this side of the House, that previous partisan affiliation is not a barrier to being appointed to important posts. EOS BOS Whether they were former Liberals, or even the fact that the President of the Treasury Board was a former Progressive Conservative, we recognize that Canadians have dedication to their country and service that we thoroughly recognize and respect. EOS BOS We will continue to make nominations based on merit, based on reflecting the full diversity of our extraordinary country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have also been promising a non-partisan appointment process for CBC's board of directors for a year and a half now. EOS BOS A year ago, in May 2016, the Minister of Canadian Heritage said that she was going to announce her much-talked-about process in the coming weeks. EOS BOS That is what she said. EOS BOS However, yesterday, we learned that half of the seats on CBC/Radio-Canada's board of directors could soon be vacant. EOS BOS When asked about that, the minister's office said that the process would be announced soon, but it did not give a specific date. EOS BOS It has been a year. EOS BOS We are starting to believe that this will never happen. EOS BOS CBC needs a competent board of directors that is not made up of Stephen Harper's friends, or the Liberals' either, for that matter. EOS BOS When will the CBC's board of directors be depoliticized? EOS BOS Will it be in a few weeks, a few months, or never? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is very proud of keeping its promise and of making major investments in the CBC for now and the future. 
              We know that Conservative supporters have been politicizing the CBC for a very long time and that we need to make the right choices to ensure the public broadcaster is managed independently. EOS BOS It is essential for our democracy to have free and independent media. EOS BOS We are going to ensure that the right people are in the right places. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is working for Bay Street. EOS BOS It tried to override Quebec's Consumer Protection Act for Bay Street, and it is setting the infrastructure bank up on Bay Street for its Bay Street buddies. EOS BOS Now Ottawa is once again facing off against Quebec in court defending another bad idea: the securities regulator. EOS BOS When will Ottawa stop taking Quebeckers' money and using it to try to undermine Quebec in court for Bay Street's benefit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we respect the jurisdiction of Quebec. EOS BOS We believe that the co-operative capital markets regime is something that can help our economy work well with risks in the economy. EOS BOS That said, we expect to be able to continue to work with those provinces that do not participate, and we will respect Quebec's decision in that regard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, she is the right candidate for the Liberals because she is a Liberal, period. EOS BOS [Translation]
              The Liberals were supposedly elected to do politics differently. EOS BOS They were not going to act like other governments before them, that is by saying one thing to get elected and something completely different once elected. EOS BOS Now here we are moments away from a vote on the electoral system. EOS BOS Will the Liberal members prove that they have more credibility than their cynical leader? EOS BOS Will they stand up to keep their promise about changing the electoral system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the members of the Special Committee on Electoral Reform for their excellent work. EOS BOS I find it a little odd that the members of the party over there want us to vote in favour of a report when they themselves did not completely agree with the report. EOS BOS The members are going to vote today, and I am satisfied that our government made the right decision. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if it were not so sad, I would say that the answers were quite ludicrous. EOS BOS Allow me to change subjects, given the quality of the answers we are getting. EOS BOS Three months after announcing that it would create a committee on the use of French as the language of work in Quebec's federally regulated businesses, this government has still not taken action, the committee has not been struck, we do not know who will sit on it, what its mandate and budget will be, or who will be the chair. EOS BOS The government's inaction clearly shows that it does not find the use of French in federally regulated businesses to be very important. EOS BOS Instead of creating diversions, will the Conservatives support our bill tomorrow? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the French language, the French fact, is far too important to just gloss over it as the member is suggesting with his bill. EOS BOS He just threw the bill together without thinking about the consequences. EOS BOS This is what we are doing: we are putting together a committee of credible people who will make recommendations. EOS BOS Then we will make an announcement in due course, after careful and thorough consideration, and not hurriedly, as is being suggested by the member for Trois-Rivières. EOS BOS That is completely irresponsible; it is far too sensitive an issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during yesterday's debate on legalizing marijuana, how many times did the Liberals talk about prevention? EOS BOS Not once, until they were asked about it. EOS BOS How many times does the word “prevention” EOS BOS appear in the bill? EOS BOS Zero. EOS BOS The cannabis task force, the provinces, stakeholders on the ground, and now teachers, too, have all talked about the need for a prevention and education campaign. EOS BOS The federal government is doing absolutely nothing to provide any financial support. EOS BOS The Liberal plan spends only six cents per person per year. EOS BOS Is this the government's way of convincing us that it understands the urgency of protecting our young people? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her emphasis on a public health approach to the introduction of the legalization of cannabis in a strict regulatory regime. EOS BOS She understands the fact that a public health approach means making sure that we maximize education and minimize harm. EOS BOS In fact, to that end, we have already started with a $9.6-million public education campaign. EOS BOS We will continue to build the resources to have a strong campaign to make sure that young people are protected, that we keep cannabis out of the hands of kids, and the profits out of the hands of criminals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. EOS BOS In Washington and Colorado, where marijuana has been legalized, road fatalities have increased. EOS BOS Just last week, the Saskatchewan Association of Chiefs of Police indicated that it was worried that the Liberals would legalize marijuana before ensuring that all the necessary tools and training are in place to protect our communities. EOS BOS My question for the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is very simple. EOS BOS Can he tell us whether police officers will receive training and whether all police vehicles in Canada will be equipped with screening devices before the government legalizes marijuana? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has been very clear that we take the issue of maintaining the safety of our roads very seriously. EOS BOS We have a made a commitment and we are committed to undertaking to ensure that law enforcement and our courts have the legislation, the technology, the training, and the resources that they will require to keep our roadways safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been asked a clear question: When did he know that his Minister of Finance held $40 million in Morneau Shepell? EOS BOS He totally dismissed that as a petty question, because the pensions of Canadians apparently are petty to the Prime Minister. EOS BOS The minister regulates pensions and his company profits from pensions, which is an obvious potential conflict of interest. EOS BOS Therefore, once again, when did the Prime Minister know that his Minister of Finance had $40 million invested in Morneau Shepell? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I expect all parliamentarians on both sides of the aisle to work with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to ensure that all the rules are followed. EOS BOS In the case of the Finance Minister, he took the advice of the Ethics Commissioner, and even offered to do more if she feels he needs to do more. EOS BOS The fact is, we will stay focused on what matters to Canadians, and what matters to Canadians is not personal attacks, but our delivering on lowering taxes for the middle class, on lowering taxes for small businesses, and on growing the economy in a way that helps everyone in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the budget includes measures for improving the temporary foreign worker program, but according to the Union des producteurs agricoles and FERME, those measures will not be implemented on time for this season. EOS BOS However, the parliamentary committee made its recommendations to the government indicating that it needed to have measures in place before January 19. EOS BOS We knew that this program was not working. EOS BOS Even the press secretary to the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour said so in an interview in La Terre de chez nous. EOS BOS Will the Liberals apologize to the farmers back home, who are going to lose thousands of dollars because of the government's inaction? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have taken concrete steps to improve the temporary foreign worker program to ensure two things: first of all that Canadians have the first chance of getting available jobs, and then that the rights of temporary foreign workers are respected in Canada and are upheld. EOS BOS Last December we strengthened the labour market impact assessment that each employer must complete. EOS BOS Employers must demonstrate concrete actions in their efforts to hire Canadians, including Canadians from under-represented groups. EOS BOS We are continuing to work on this program and we are confident that we are getting it right. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, farmers, especially in the Prairies, need better access to interswitching to get their crops to market. EOS BOS This was identified as a key issue in the Emerson report. EOS BOS But extended rights under the Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act are set to expire on August 1 of this year. EOS BOS This means that many farmers could lose access to markets this season, which would lead to severe hardship. EOS BOS Will the government commit today to legally extend these rights for fair rail access before the House rises in the summer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we want to talk about grain production, and for the 2015-16 grain shipping year, it is estimated to be the second largest on record. EOS BOS The performance of the grain handling and transportation system has kept pace or exceeded the record levels of performance seen last year. EOS BOS Given the challenges faced by western Canadian rail systems in the winter of 2013-14, the statutory review of the Canada Transportation Act was accelerated by one year and asked to give grain transportation priority consideration. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in spite of warnings from the opposition, the Prime Minister appointed Daniel Therrien as Privacy Commissioner. EOS BOS An officer of Parliament should not be judging the policies he developed, especially when they are controversial ones, such as the security perimeter policy. EOS BOS The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada was very critical of this measure, so why did the Prime Minister appoint one of the negotiators of this initiative to head this office? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Therrien is a well-qualified candidate who would bring significant experience in law and privacy issues to the position. EOS BOS This appointment was made following a rigorous process that identified Mr. Therrien as the best candidate. EOS BOS According to the NDP, having actual experience working on privacy issues in government somehow makes someone less qualified to be privacy commissioner. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Conservatives were caught misusing the Communications Security Establishment. EOS BOS They were caught doing nothing while Canadians saw their privacy breached, and they put forward legislation allowing spying on Canadians based on suspicion alone. EOS BOS Our last privacy watchdog raised alarm bells about the government's privacy policy. EOS BOS Now the Conservatives are replacing her with the person who designed the policy. EOS BOS That is not balanced, so will the Conservatives reconsider this appointment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Therrien has more public service in this country than that member and I together. EOS BOS Mr. Therrien, as I said, is a well-qualified candidate who would bring significant experience in law and privacy issues to the position. EOS BOS The appointment was made following a rigorous process that identified Mr. Therrien as the best candidate. EOS BOS According, again, to the NDP, having actual experience working on privacy issues in government somehow makes someone less qualified to be privacy commissioner. EOS BOS I am not sure what else to say. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since the Conservatives came to power seven years ago, one in seven jobs created have been filled by a temporary foreign worker, while at the same time a quarter of a million new Canadians have found themselves unemployed. EOS BOS Blaming rogue companies, feigning concern, and promising reviews just does not cut it anymore. EOS BOS Canadians do not trust the government to run this program, to review this program, and certainly not to fix this program. EOS BOS My question is to the minister. EOS BOS Will she let Parliament do its job and let it fix this Conservative mess? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the goal of the temporary foreign worker program has always been to help provide labour where there is an acute and extended shortage of skills within the country, because we believe that Canadians should always have first crack at Canadian jobs. EOS BOS Let us face it, the hon. EOS BOS member is blowing out of both sides. EOS BOS Right now he is saying that the program is not there, and it should work, yet he is asking for more people to be brought in under the temporary foreign worker program for his own riding. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the program is very poorly managed and that is why workers are losing their jobs and employers cannot find— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I will say it again so that the minister understands. EOS BOS Her program is so poorly managed that Canadian workers are losing their jobs because of it and Canadian employers cannot find foreign workers because of all the bureaucracy involved in the program. EOS BOS Together with the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, she let the program get so completely out of hand that she launched a review six months ago. EOS BOS However, we still have not received an answer. EOS BOS We have no idea when she will improve the program. EOS BOS Since she does not know how to do her job, she should let Parliament do it for her. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our priority is to create jobs. EOS BOS We also want to connect Canadians with jobs that are available across Canada. EOS BOS That is our objective, our top priority. EOS BOS When you have a clear and major shortage, you must look for people elsewhere to fill those positions temporarily. EOS BOS We are aware that there are problems with the program. EOS BOS That is why, in budget 2013, we announced that we would make changes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have been in office for a year and a half. EOS BOS For a year and a half, the economy has been mismanaged, no full-time jobs have been created, and SMEs have been abandoned. EOS BOS What is the government's solution? EOS BOS It is overtaxing SMEs, which is cutting into their revenue and preventing them from hiring middle-class workers, all so that it can finance its out-of-control spending. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister directly attacking those who contribute the most to our economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government does understand the importance of small and medium-sized businesses. EOS BOS We understand that they are the backbone of the economy. EOS BOS They are proud of the work that they do, especially in the tourism industry where we have seen a boom of $90 billion this summer for 192,000 small and medium-sized businesses. EOS BOS And they are small businesses. EOS BOS Also, with the investments we have done in infrastructure, they, too, are small and medium-sized businesses. EOS BOS We are doing a lot to help them, and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in my riding, the chamber of commerce is worried about all the things the Liberals are doing to kill small business and eliminate job expansion, like the carbon tax, higher taxes for business, more regulation, and concerns about being uncompetitive with our neighbour south of the border. EOS BOS Then, when the Liberals could give us infrastructure money to create 3,000 jobs in my riding, the infrastructure minister has done nothing about it in a year and a half. EOS BOS When will the Liberals put their money where they mouths are and support creation of jobs in my riding? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question, because it gives me an opportunity to remind the House that we have invested $12 million in Sarnia— EOS BOS Lambton, in Bioindustrial Innovation Canada, for 478 jobs. EOS BOS This is a pattern that is repeating itself across the country, with the innovation ministry, with the infrastructure ministry. EOS BOS We are investing in Canadian technology. EOS BOS We are creating Canadian jobs, including in Sarnia—Lambton. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to give the Minister of Canadian Heritage another chance. EOS BOS She said that stakeholder groups fully support the process. EOS BOS The Quebec Community Groups Network, the representative of anglophones in the province of Quebec, and the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne both have said that they have concerns with the process by which the government has proposed the new Commissioner of Official Languages. EOS BOS Will the government and the minister admit that the process is flawed and commit to restarting this process? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in the context of finding the Commissioner of Official Languages, we did a thorough process. EOS BOS I have had the chance to explain this process to my colleague many times. EOS BOS We know that the candidate who came out of this thorough, merit-based process is a good candidate. EOS BOS She is a woman who has been involved in the protection and promotion of official languages for the past 30 years. EOS BOS Her knowledge of the field and her passion for official languages are unparalleled, and therefore, we know we have the right candidate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two major stakeholder groups representing francophone linguistic minority communities and Acadia throughout this country and anglophones in the province of Quebec have voiced concerns about the process. EOS BOS Last January, the Prime Minister refused to hold the spirit of the Official Languages Act by refusing to respond to an anglophone in Quebec in English. EOS BOS Now the Liberals have failed to consult with leaders of the recognized parties here in the House of Commons and the Senate before coming forward with this nomination. EOS BOS This process is flawed. EOS BOS The government lacks respect for the Official Languages Act. EOS BOS When will it restart this process and give us a real nomination? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our official languages are a priority for our government. EOS BOS My colleague gives me an opportunity to talk about what we have done on official languages in the past 18 months after inaction on the part of the Conservative government on this particular file. EOS BOS We reinstated francophone immigration services. EOS BOS We made sure to give university accreditation to Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean. EOS BOS We made sure to appoint a bilingual justice from Newfoundland to the Supreme Court. EOS BOS We have done many things. EOS BOS I am working right now on a future plan on official languages. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not easy to keep track of what is happening in the House right now. EOS BOS The government and the Minister of Canadian Heritage keep saying that the process for appointing a commissioner of official languages is neutral and has nothing to do with politics. EOS BOS However, the candidates were picked from a pool of Liberal Party donors. EOS BOS From there, we come to the Standing Committee on Official Languages, where Ms. Meilleur admits that she talked with Gerry Butts. EOS BOS Today, the Minister of Canadian Heritage says, first, that she never talked with Mr. Butts, and then, that she did talk with Mr. Butts EOS BOS . 
              I will give the minister another chance. EOS BOS Yes or no, did she talk with Mr. Butts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we found an excellent candidate, Madeleine Meilleur, who was very involved in protecting Ottawa’s francophone hospital, the Montfort Hospital. EOS BOS She also created within the Ontario government the position of French-language services commissioner, which is the equivalent of the commissioner of official languages. EOS BOS That is why she is duly qualified to impartially and knowledgeably fulfill this key role. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are waging war on small businesses. EOS BOS Family-run operations like campgrounds and self-storage facilities are being targeted for being too small to be a small business and are receiving huge new tax bills. EOS BOS The Minister of National Revenue keeps claiming that she knows the critical role that small businesses play, even while the government ended the review of active versus passive business income rules that would have ensured small businesses had access to the small business tax rate, as they should. EOS BOS Will these Liberals stop talking out of both sides of their mouth and actually stand up for small businesses instead of trying to tax them out of existence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, small businesses play a vital role in Canada. EOS BOS We work with all small businesses. EOS BOS The rules have not changed and they apply to all small businesses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, both our rural and urban communities need help to revitalize their infrastructure. EOS BOS Take, for example, the Champlain Bridge. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities says that a permanent infrastructure development program will be implemented, but it is time to take action. EOS BOS Will this development be sustainable? EOS BOS Will public transit be part of the plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has already invested a record amount of money in infrastructure. EOS BOS Our government also has an exceptional track record when it comes to transfers to cities and municipalities. EOS BOS [English]Since 2009, our government has committed unprecedented stimulus contributions, which were announced in the March budget and which will be once again introduced today, with improvements, that the gas tax fund will be made permanent. EOS BOS That is an achievement of this government. EOS BOS We are proud of it and we are going to move forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the 1990s, the federal deficit was downloaded onto the backs of Canadian communities. EOS BOS Twenty years later, Canadians are stuck in traffic, our bridges are crumbling, and our water systems are failing. EOS BOS Friday's throne speech ignored municipalities and infrastructure completely. Canadians deserve a vision, a national public transit strategy. EOS BOS Will the government act immediately with new funds to deal with the $123 billion infrastructure deficit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member will recall that in 2007, we extended the gas tax fund by four years. EOS BOS In 2009, we doubled the gas tax fund. EOS BOS In 2010, despite economic challenges and despite efforts to keep costs down, we protected the gas tax fund. EOS BOS In today's budget, she will have occasion to stand and join hands with our government as we move forward with an effort to make the gas tax fund permanent in order to help our communities right across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all of the available evidence, including evidence from the Department of Justice, shows that mandatory minimum sentences are excessive, ineffective, disproportionate, costly and do nothing but increase prison populations. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Justice present to the House the evidence on which he based his decision to support mandatory minimum sentences? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this matter has been the subject of extensive debate, not only in the House, but also in committee. EOS BOS All documents indicating the costs involved have been tabled. EOS BOS As we know, victims are the ones who bear the cost of crime. EOS BOS We are talking about a total cost of $99.6 billion, 83% of which is borne by the victims. EOS BOS We support the victims, while they support the criminals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the justice for victims of terrorism act would give victims of terror a civil remedy against their terrorist perpetrators, but it would limit the remedy by immunizing the state perpetrator of terrorism, allowing the remedy to be used only against proxies or agents of the state sponsor. EOS BOS Why is the government denying Canadians an effective remedy against states that support terrorist proxies or that commit the terrorist acts themselves? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know the member has been working on this file for a long time, and we appreciate the support that he has provided in giving us advice. EOS BOS We have proceeded in the way that we have in the bill because of the advice we received from various organizations. EOS BOS We believe that this is the most effective way to ensure that terrorists are held accountable and that victims have a remedy in situations where they would otherwise not have a remedy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the Conservative Party is debating the merits of Canada's supply management system, our party fully understands that this system is a model of stability that provides fair prices for farmers, stability for processors, and safe, high-quality products at reasonable prices for consumers. EOS BOS We know that this system supports farm families and rural communities across the country. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Agriculture tell us what the Conservative plan to eliminate supply management would mean for Canadian farmers and farm families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our party fully supports our dairy farmers and our supply management system. EOS BOS We are the party that fought to implement supply management, and we are the government that will continue to support supply management. EOS BOS The Conservative plan to eliminate supply management would cost billions of dollars. EOS BOS It would cause the closure of many farms and it would not affect the price of the product. EOS BOS Our government will continue to work closely with our farmers to protect and defend our farmers, which very much includes our supply management sector. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has over 1.3 million people of Canadian Ukrainian heritage. EOS BOS As a country, we truly care about what is happening in Ukraine. EOS BOS This past Sunday, the people of Ukraine voted for building a stronger and healthier relationship with the west and against the far right. EOS BOS Ukrainian President Poroshenko told Canadians that he would like to see a trade deal between our two nations. EOS BOS Could the government provide a status report on the trade talks between Canada and Ukraine? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in July the Minister of International Trade led a trade and development mission to Ukraine aimed at deepening economic co-operation with Ukraine. EOS BOS Our government is committed to supporting efforts to build a peaceful, democratic and proper society in Ukraine. EOS BOS Ukraine is a priority market under Canada's global markets action plan. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post belongs to us and is mandated to provide postal service to all Canadians. EOS BOS Lately, Conservatives have been whittling away at economically stable elements of Canada Post and have moved toward privatization. EOS BOS Does the government not realize that no private alternative can deliver Canada Post's mandate? EOS BOS Will the government use its influence to make sure management remembers that its mandate is to serve Canadians comes first? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to quality postal service for all Canadians no matter where they live. EOS BOS Last year, Canada Post began a $2.1 billion modernization initiative which will make major investments in equipment, technology and other processes. EOS BOS We are making Canada Post more effective for Canadians, the clients, the people whom Canada Post serves, and I think Canadians will be very pleased with the results. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year, Canada Post made $281 million in profit; yet, it is still asking its employees for concessions. EOS BOS This attitude threatens services in rural and remote areas. EOS BOS No private sector alternative would be able to deliver the mandate of Canada Post, which is to provide postal service to all Canadians. EOS BOS Will the federal government use its influence to remind Canada Post's management that its primary mandate is to provide services to all Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is mandated to provide postal service to Canadians regardless of where they live. EOS BOS Canada Post has made substantial investments in the infrastructure of Canada Post to the sum of $2.1 billion, as I have already mentioned. EOS BOS We are working to ensure that Canadians receive the best possible postal service regardless of where they live, and I look forward to working with the opposition parties and all stakeholders to ensure that Canadians get their mail when they ask for it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Charmaine Stick, a member of the Onion Lake Cree Nation, is here in Ottawa today pleading with the Liberals to enforce the First Nations Financial Transparency Act. EOS BOS Band members are often told that there is no money to pay for essentials like housing repairs or medical supplies. EOS BOS For years, Charmaine has been trying to get her band leadership to tell her where the money is going. EOS BOS Now she has finally resorted to going to court. EOS BOS Instead of enforcing the law, why are the Liberals forcing grassroots band members to go to court to get basic information? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we believe that transparency is very important in all aspects of government. EOS BOS We are working very hard with aboriginal governments across Canada to develop an act that is truly transparent and ensures full accountability. EOS BOS In communities like Onion Lake, for example, we have been involved in working with the leadership in that community, and we want to ensure that we can increase transparency and accountability with its first nation leadership and all of its organizations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration's study of family reunification, we heard from many witnesses that the two-year conditional permanent residence for sponsored spouses is a serious problem. EOS BOS It is leaving spouses, particularly women, to stay in abusive relationships for fear of jeopardizing their immigration status, and they are afraid to report the abuse to authorities. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship tell the House what his department is doing to support the spouses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this measure that was introduced by the Conservatives in 2012 put vulnerable spouses, especially women, at risk of abuse and violence. EOS BOS I am proud of the fact that we have gotten rid of this measure and eliminated it completely. EOS BOS The Conservatives refused to listen and ignored the advice of women's rights advocates, as well as newcomers themselves, who continually denounced this measure. EOS BOS As a government, we have committed to gender equality and to combatting gender-based violence. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been quoted in a Saskatchewan newspaper that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food “might very well go down as the worst ever to hold the job”. EOS BOS Canadian farmers are well aware of the reasons. EOS BOS First was the mishandling of food safety, then it was the slashing of agriculture programs, and as we found out all this week, there is a disaster in grain handling. EOS BOS His biggest failure is today, with the signing of the U.S. farm bill, which includes country of origin labelling, which will continue to cost our livestock producers hundreds of millions of dollars. EOS BOS Will the minister finally stand up and do something for the farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am actually surprised that this member is attacking our minister on this file. EOS BOS Our minister has taken the lead in defending our livestock farmers on the COOL file. EOS BOS We have personally been down to the United States. EOS BOS We have interacted with some politicians down there, defending our farmers time and again. EOS BOS I would ask this member and his colleagues to get on board with this government putting farmers first. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member's answer shows his dissociation with reality and how it has devastated farmers. EOS BOS Today is not the first day the Conservative government has heard about the United States' plan to solidify country of origin labelling into law the President will now sign. EOS BOS Today is not the first day the Conservative government has been asked to act. EOS BOS Yet the government is still fiddling while farmers in our agricultural sector lose billions. EOS BOS The Conservatives have gotten really good at threatening to act. EOS BOS When are they going to act and finally protect Canadian farmers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, just to show how out of touch the member is with farmers, I will read a quote from the Canadian Cattlemen's Association:The CCA fully supports the Government of Canada's efforts to pursue WTO approval to impose retaliatory tariffs. EOS BOS As I just explained, our minister has been front and centre in defending our livestock farmers, our beef farms, and our pork farmers against the COOL legislation. EOS BOS We will continue to act in their best interests, and I would ask the opposition to support us in this very important work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, the study on aviation safety has already revealed that representatives of pilots and workers support Justice Moshansky's proposal to hold a public, independent inquiry on aviation safety. EOS BOS Justice Moshansky, who is recognized for his credibility, states that the federal government is gambling with aviation safety because Transport Canada has completely abandoned conventional regulatory oversight. EOS BOS What will the Minister of Transport do to fix the situation after years of Liberal and Conservative cuts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you know, aviation safety is a priority for us, and we are constantly looking at ways to improve it EOS BOS .
              We must be constantly vigilant and ensure that the aviation network is safe. EOS BOS We use a risk-based approach to do this. EOS BOS Our department conducted over 10,000 inspections last year. EOS BOS We will continue to be vigilant, and if changes are needed, we will make them. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice continues to sit on her hands with a near record number of judicial vacancies. EOS BOS Meanwhile, another day and another murder case has been thrown out of court, this time in Montreal, and all the minister can do is pat herself on the back. EOS BOS The minister's indifference to this crisis is nothing short of appalling, and the minister's inaction is nothing short of negligent. EOS BOS How many more victims are going to be denied justice because of the minister's negligence? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am fine to stand up to talk about the open and transparent appointments process that we have instituted for judges in the superior courts across the country. EOS BOS I am going to continue to add to the 67 appointments— EOS
BOS Ten judges not even appointed. EOS </s> BOS Order. I am sure the hon. EOS BOS member for St. Albert—Edmonton wants to hear the answer to his question, so I would ask him to please be quiet. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Justice. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am going to continue to add to the 67 appointments that I have made to superior courts across the country. EOS BOS In the province of Quebec, which the member opposite references, there is less than a 1% vacancy in the superior courts. EOS BOS There are many reasons for delays. EOS BOS It is a shared responsibility between the federal government and the provinces and territories, and we are acting on addressing— EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as a result of a barrage of tweets from Donald Trump, our supply management system is now being targeted by U.S. lobby groups. EOS BOS In Quebec, we are proud of our farming model of family-owned farms. EOS BOS The Liberals already abandoned our dairy farmers during negotiations with Europe. EOS BOS They had better not do the same with NAFTA. EOS BOS Will the minister make a solemn commitment to keep the supply management system precisely as it is, with no changes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure my hon. colleague that this government is the government that will protect supply management and EOS BOS this is the party that fought to put it in place. EOS BOS This is also the government that put the innovation package together to make sure that supply management in the dairy sector in the country thrived. EOS BOS I can assure my hon. EOS BOS colleague that this government has and will continue to support supply management. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when Air Canada was privatized under a previous Conservative government, the deputy prime minister of the day, Mr. Mazankowski, said, “The Act would have to be amended if there were going to be any modification concerning the transfer of AIR CANADA's Overhaul Centres to another location”.That is a very clear indication as to what the deputy prime minister of the day said was in the law and the protection provided to workers. EOS BOS I would like to ask the government spokesman today if he could tell us this. EOS BOS Does he agree or does he disagree with the statement that was made by the deputy prime minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first of all, we obviously regret, seriously, all of us, all parties, the loss of these jobs. EOS BOS It is very unfortunate for the workers affected. EOS BOS However, let us be clear. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport has called for legal advice in respect of the obligations that may exist. EOS BOS He has also asked the transport committee of this place to study the issue, to call the parties together, to get a full and transparent view of the views of all of those concerned. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem is that, by the time the government gets around to doing anything about it, these jobs will have long been gone to El Salvador or somewhere else. EOS BOS That is the problem with the government's answer. EOS BOS The government spent $300 million moving a military base from Dubai to Kuwait because it alleged it would be protecting, in the words of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, tens of thousands of jobs in Canada. EOS BOS The government cannot avoid its direct responsibility with respect to what is happening to Air Canada. EOS BOS Air Canada is the government's baby. EOS BOS Aveos is Air Canada's baby. EOS BOS When is the Government of Canada going to take some responsibility— EOS BOS The Speaker: The Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, we all regret when there is any loss of jobs. EOS BOS The reality, though, is that in the past two years we have seen the creation of more than 610,000 net new jobs. EOS BOS The leader of the third party would have us increase taxes on employers and businesses in Canada, which would have the result of killing hundreds of thousands of jobs, just as he did when he was premier of Ontario and had the worst economic record in the history of that province. EOS BOS Thankfully, he will not be able to do to Canada what he did to Ontario. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Health Council of Canada released its 2011 progress report and the conclusion is very clear. EOS BOS The government failed to make progress because it failed to show leadership. EOS BOS Conservatives stalled altogether on a cost-saving national prescription drug program, failing Canadians who are now facing extraordinary drug costs. EOS BOS Will the government acknowledge its lack of progress and commit to working with New Democrats to protect Canada's health care system? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleague for the next four years. EOS BOS Our government recognizes the importance of timely access to health care and is working to support the provinces and the territories in their efforts to address the issue of wait times, as an example. EOS BOS We have increased the transfers to the provinces by over 33% since we formed government, so that the provinces and territories can continue to focus in areas of importance. EOS BOS We will work collaboratively with the provinces and territories to renew the health care accord and to continue to reduce wait times in their respective jurisdictions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, health care is far too important for just empty rhetoric and Canadians are very tired of false promises. EOS BOS Leading into the 2014 health care negotiations, now is the time to bring in much needed improvements. EOS BOS Will the government commit to holding open consultations with Canadians, so that the next accord reflects their values and priorities for health care in this country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we are looking forward to working with the provinces and territories to renew the health accord and to continue to address the area of wait times, as an example, while respecting the fact that health care is delivered by and is under the jurisdiction of the provinces. EOS BOS Our discussions will emphasize the importance of accountability and results for Canadians, including better reporting from the provinces and territories to measure progress and guarantees covering additional medically necessary procedures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, housing is a key issue of concern for the residents of my riding. EOS BOS Affordable housing, co-operative housing, social housing, and housing for our aging and ethnic populations are top of mind for Davenport residents. EOS BOS Our government has taken important measures to answer the housing needs in this country by investing $2.3 billion in budget 2016 and has introduced a much-needed $11.2 billion for the national housing strategy in budget 2017. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development provide more details to the House on this important investment and how it will address the needs not only of those living in Davenport but all Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Davenport for being such a strong advocate for housing. EOS BOS Our government is investing in affordable housing to help Canadians who need it most. EOS BOS That is why our national housing strategy will demonstrate the most ambitious federal housing leadership in over half a century. EOS BOS Our strategy will ensure that Canadians have adequate and affordable housing and will provide stable housing for homeless Canadians. EOS BOS These measures will take 500,000 Canadians out of housing need and lead to more inclusive communities and a stronger economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's infrastructure bank should offer his billionaire buddies a return on their investment. EOS BOS This means user fees and tolls. EOS BOS The Prime Minister eliminated the toll from the Champlain Bridge. EOS BOS Is he now saying that he supports tolls?Who will make these decisions, the Prime Minister, mayors, the provinces, or investment firms? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the unprecedented investments our government is making. EOS BOS Some $180 billion will be invested over the next 12 years in green infrastructure, social infrastructure, public transit, and transportation corridors to enhance trade. EOS BOS We also created an infrastructure bank so that investors can contribute and we can do even more to enhance our infrastructure. EOS BOS That is what Canadians want. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if foreign billionaires loan the Canadian government money for bridges, hospitals, and schools, they are not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. EOS BOS They are looking for a return. EOS BOS Jobs will be a cost that is kept to a minimum, and taxpayer dollars will come second to their profits whenever a project goes over budget. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister explain what safeguards he will put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars are treated with respect, and do not simply become a backstop for the margins of billionaire investors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we always treat our tax dollars with great respect in this government. EOS BOS We have decided to make unprecedented investments in infrastructure, something that was never done by the previous government. EOS BOS We will invest $180 billion during the next 12 years in green infrastructure, social infrastructure, public transit, and transportation corridors. EOS BOS This is a good thing for Canada, and we have created an infrastructure bank so we can get even more money to put into our infrastructure. EOS BOS Canadians want this. EOS BOS It creates jobs. EOS BOS It is good for the economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister likes to pretend that Nigel Wright acted alone, but the $90,000 cheque to Mike Duffy was just the tip of the iceberg. EOS BOS Others knew about the plan to have the party pay, and even more knew about the offers to whitewash the Senate report and keep Mike Duffy in the Senate. EOS BOS There is a culture of cover-up and corruption in the Prime Minster's Office. EOS BOS When is the Prime Minister finally going to come clean? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Wright has been very clear: he undertook these particular actions using his own resources, his own authority, and his own initiative. EOS BOS He has taken responsibility for that and is being held accountable. EOS BOS I also note, of course, that last night the Senate held accountable the three senators who have systematically disregarded or violated spending rules, and we congratulate it for taking that action. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, did the Prime Minister know about the plan to use Conservative Party funds to reimburse the illegal expenses of Mike Duffy? EOS BOS No weasel words—yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, my clear view on this was that Mr. Duffy's expenses could not be justified. EOS BOS He had claimed expenses he had not incurred, and I had told him, including telling him directly, that he should repay those funds. EOS BOS I was later told that he had, which, of course, was not true. EOS BOS That is one of the reasons the Senate has acted as it has, and we congratulate it for that action. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not know what it is that makes the Prime Minister so afraid to answer such a straightforward, clear question. EOS BOS [Translation]Jenni Byrne was working at Conservative Party headquarters, but the Prime Minister brought her back to his office to manage the Senate expense scandal. EOS BOS Was Jenni Byrne aware of the plan to use Conservative Party funds to pay back Mike Duffy's expenses? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the leader of the NDP is again making allegations against others without any evidence. EOS BOS The facts are clear: Mr. Wright acted on his own initiative and he has taken responsibility for what he did. EOS BOS He is being held accountable for his actions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the question was simple and perfectly clear. EOS BOS It required a simple yes or no answer. EOS BOS The Prime Minister continues with his stonewalling. EOS BOS Was Irving Gerstein, the Conservative Party leader's top fundraiser, aware of the scheme to use Conservative Party funds to reimburse Mike Duffy's expenses? EOS BOS Yes or no? EOS </s> BOS I see the right hon. Prime Minister rising to answer the question, but I just want to remind members that there have been many Speaker's rulings about the clear delineation between party activity and government activity. EOS BOS As I heard it, it seemed mostly to deal with party business, but I will let the right hon. Prime Minister answer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the leader of the NDP is once again trying to pin the blame on one person for someone else's actions.
							[English]The facts here are absolutely clear. EOS BOS Mr. Wright has been very clear on all of these matters. EOS BOS He has taken full responsibility for his actions and he is being held accountable, as we expect in this party. EOS BOS We hold people personally accountable for their actions. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, just to be perfectly clear, this is about a cover-up in the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS This is government business. EOS BOS This is the public's business. EOS BOS Did Senator Gerstein approve the plan to use party money to repay Duffy's illegal expenses when he thought that the cost was just $32,000? EOS BOS Is it a question of principle or a question of price? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I will remind the member, once again, that as soon as I became aware of these facts we made those facts available to the public. EOS BOS We all know the party did not pay Mr. Duffy's inappropriate expenses. EOS BOS He was supposed to pay those himself. EOS BOS Indeed, he claimed he had paid those himself. EOS BOS He had not. EOS BOS Obviously, for that reason he is no longer a member of our caucus and has been further sanctioned by the Senate, as is appropriate. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, tonight this House will vote on a motion that will compel everyone involved in the PMO ethics scandal, including the Prime Minister, to testify under oath. EOS BOS I am sure every single Conservative MP would agree with their former colleague from Edmonton—St. EOS BOS Albert that their constituents want answers. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister allow a free vote so that Conservative MPs can express the will of their constituents tonight? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party had its chance in the Senate last night to demonstrate some kind of accountability. EOS BOS Of course what the Liberal senators did was exactly what we would expect, as they have all through this defended the rights of senators to do whatever they want to do, whether they are within the rules or not. EOS BOS Once again, the Liberal Party on that side has exhibited the culture we have come to know from that party, which is the culture of one being entitled to his or her entitlements. EOS BOS On this side, we expect people to follow the rules. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have heard time and time again across this country that Canadians are disappointed, that the strong voices elected from their communities have turned into the Prime Minister's voice in their communities. EOS BOS In the vote tonight, will the Prime Minister allow his MPs to speak up for their constituents or will they participate in this cover-up? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the leader of the Liberal Party were indeed listening to Canadians, he would know that Canadians did expect those senators who broke or systematically disregarded expense rules to be removed from the public payroll. EOS BOS In fact, the Liberal Party did not do that, with one exception. EOS BOS The Liberal senators would have allowed the senators to continue without any sanction whatsoever. EOS BOS Fortunately, the vast majority of Conservative senators felt otherwise and have imposed that sanction. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Senator Gerstein was aware of the Duffy affair and he still has his job. EOS BOS The people in the Prime Minister's Office involved in this scheme were simply shuffled off. EOS BOS Canadians across the country want their MPs to express the will of their constituents, who want to know more. EOS BOS For the third time, will the Prime Minister allow his MPs to have a free vote on this motion this evening in order to get to the bottom of this and reassure their constituents that they are listening to them? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the will of Canadians is crystal clear. EOS BOS They want the senators who claimed inappropriate expenses to no longer be on the public payroll. EOS BOS The Liberal Party voted to keep those senators in office. EOS BOS Fortunately, the vast majority of Conservative senators voted to impose serious sanctions on those senators. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Nigel Wright has told the police that Irving Gerstein approved the original plan to pay back Mike Duffy's illegal expenses using party money. EOS BOS Gerstein told the Conservative convention this weekend that he dismissed the idea out of hand. EOS BOS Both cannot be true. EOS BOS Did Senator Gerstein lie to Conservative Party members? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the decision to repay Mr. Duffy's inappropriate expenses was Mr. Wright's decision. EOS BOS That is a decision he took himself and that he has taken responsibility for. EOS BOS Obviously, his actions and those of Mr. Duffy were not accurately communicated to me or to the Canadian people. EOS BOS That is where the responsibility lies. EOS BOS That is where it does lie, and they are being held accountable. EOS </s> BOS Actually, Mr. Speaker, the word “lie” does apply, but one of those two versions has to be a lie. EOS BOS Mr. Gerstein cannot be telling the truth, and Nigel Wright. EOS BOS The question was, did Gerstein approve the plan, yes or no, and as usual the Prime Minister refuses to answer. EOS BOS Let us talk about legal expenses. EOS BOS Of the legal expenses the party did cover for Mike Duffy, the Prime Minister 's office said, “ EOS BOS The party was assured the invoice was for valid legal fees related to the audit process”. EOS BOS What legal work was done relating to the audit process? EOS
BOS Of course, Mr. Speaker, that is a matter of party business, not government business. EOS BOS The facts have been made very clear on that. EOS BOS Political parties do provide legal support to their members of Parliament, of both Houses, from time to time. EOS BOS The leader of the NDP should be no stranger to this. EOS BOS He not only has claimed legal expenses from his party, he even succeeded in getting his party to pay court damages against him for a court case, when he lost. EOS BOS I know of no parallel to that in our party. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, did the Conservative Party cover the legal fees of the other senators who are subject to the very same audit? EOS
BOS Again, the question is on the activities of a party. EOS BOS The question includes the phrase “did the Conservative Party”. EOS BOS It is not part of the Prime Minister's responsibilities as Prime Minister. EOS BOS I see the right hon. Prime Minister rising to answer the question. EOS BOS Nonetheless, I hope all members will keep in mind that questions have to relate to the government's responsibilities. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you well know, the decision to provide legal assistance to MPs and senators is made by the political parties. EOS BOS As far as spending taxpayers' money is concerned, that is up to the boards of internal economy of both houses. EOS BOS It is not up to the government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the question was, why one and not the other? EOS BOS Let us look at another example. EOS BOS The Prime Minister said it is clearly inappropriate to try to collect travel expenses when one is living at a resident he or she has not had for many, many years. EOS BOS Carolyn Stewart Olsen admits she charged her expenses to taxpayers for a home she lived in for decades before becoming a senator. EOS BOS Why was it appropriate in her case? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Senate has been very clear; it is looking at the expenditures of all senators. EOS BOS The Leader of the Opposition once again makes broad-brush allegations against all kinds of employees and senators. EOS BOS I have no information that would corroborate what he said, but obviously we will see what the final findings of the audit of the Senate will be. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, has anyone from the Prime Minister's Office discussed the investigation of Rod Zimmer's expenses with Conservatives in the Senate? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of what that discussion would be. EOS BOS I understand this particular member is no longer a member of the Senate. EOS BOS Although this is Senate business, it is my understanding that the Senate is examining, during this Parliament, the expenditures of all senators, past and present. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, who in the Prime Minister's Office prepares senators for media interviews? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, from time to time the Prime Minister's Office provides advice to members and senators about talking to the media. EOS BOS However, members and senators are constitutionally responsible for their actions and their words. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, who practises answering questions with the senators from time to time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am starting to really have trouble figuring out what any of this has to do with government business. EOS BOS As I just said, if anybody breaks rules, they are held accountable. EOS BOS We do not accept that in this party. EOS BOS We hold people accountable when they take actions that they should not have taken. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, taxpayers pay for it; it is in the Prime Minister's Office, but what does that have to do with the government? 
							[Translation]If it is true that the Prime Minister lost confidence in Nigel Wright on May 15, why did his office give Nigel Wright a vote of confidence on behalf of the Prime Minister two days later, on May 17? EOS BOS This just does not add up. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Wright accepted responsibility for the actions he took with his own resources, under his own authority and on his own initiative. EOS BOS Mr. EOS BOS Wright's actions were clearly not acceptable and he admitted it. EOS BOS He took responsibility and he is being held accountable for his actions by the authorities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, fish harvesters attending the Gulf Groundfish Advisory Committee in Moncton expressed their frustration and disbelief over the Liberals' inaction in protecting groundfish stocks by controlling the grey seal population. EOS BOS Despite scientists confirming that grey seals are responsible for declining fish populations, the minister has failed to take action. EOS BOS Given the importance of the fishery to communities in rural Atlantic Canada, especially in light of the drastic reductions in the shrimp quota, will the minister commit to using a portion of the new Atlantic fisheries fund to address growing seal populations that are preventing the recovery of commercially valuable fish stocks? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as you know, our government is committed to supporting a sustainable, humane, and well-regulated seal hunt. EOS BOS This commitment is in keeping with the government's priorities, which include a renewed relationship with Canada's indigenous communities and inclusive growth for rural and coastal communities. EOS BOS We recognize the economic and cultural value of the seal hunt for Canadians who participate, including indigenous groups, individuals, and commercial hunters. EOS BOS We will not tolerate inhumane seal hunting practices. EOS BOS During the seal hunt, fisheries officers monitor activities via regular at-sea and dockside inspections, as well as aerial patrols. EOS BOS We will work very hard to ensure that our seal hunt is sustainable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians with disabilities face challenges every day that prevent them from fully participating in activities in their communities and in their workplaces. EOS BOS We have a duty to reduce barriers to accessibility and provide equal access and equal opportunities for all Canadians. EOS BOS Everyone deserves a level playing field. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities tell the members of the House about the measures she has taken to reduce barriers to accessibility? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Madawaska— EOS BOS Restigouche for his question. EOS BOS This is National AccessAbility Week, which is a time to celebrate, emphasize, and promote inclusion and accessibility across Canada. EOS BOS We also invite all those who may be eligible to apply for funding through the enabling accessibility fund call for proposals we are launching today. EOS BOS [English]
              Our government wants more Canadians with disabilities who face challenges every day to participate fully in their communities and the economy. EOS BOS That is why we have increased our investments in the program to over $80 million. EOS BOS This historic investment will remove barriers for many Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today, the National Assembly passed a bill on religious neutrality. EOS BOS Whether the federal government agrees or not, that is the National Assembly's absolute right. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister commit to not doing what was done with Bill 99? EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister commit to not challenge Bill 62 in court and to not to fund potential challenges of this bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to all Canadians. EOS BOS One of my responsibilities as Prime Minister is to uphold the charter EOS BOS . I will continue to ensure that all Canadians are protected by the charter, all while respecting the choices made by lawmakers at all levels. EOS BOS Nevertheless, the federal government will defend the rights of all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when we were first elected, our government significantly increased the budget for the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS BOS This allowed the military to undertake some major capital acquisitions, including the purchase of four C-17 Globemaster strategic airlift craft, 17 C-130J Hercules tactical transport aircraft, and the Aurora modernization project. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Justice please update the House on the contribution our modern CP-140 Auroras and CF Greenwood will be making to Operation Impact in the fight against ISIL? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last week I had the honour, with the member for West Nova, to visit 14 Wing Greenwood in Nova Scotia, where two of our modernized Aurora surveillance aircraft were departing for Kuwait as part of Operation Impact to assist in the campaign against ISIL terrorists. EOS BOS The modernized CP-140 Aurora aircraft, work that was done, as he mentioned, in Nova Scotia, offer the Royal Canadian Air Force a world-class capability and are among the most effective man surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft in the world. EOS BOS They bring a lot to the fight. EOS BOS On behalf of all Canadians, I want to thank the courageous men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces for the work they do defending Canada's interests at home and abroad. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the public finance committee of Quebec's National Assembly tabled its report on the use of tax havens. EOS BOS Unlike Ottawa, the Quebec government wants to put an end to the injustice caused by the complacency of our institutions, the consulting firms that engage in tax evasion, and the 1% of very wealthy people who are willing to do whatever it takes to avoid paying taxes. EOS BOS Are the 40 Liberal members from Quebec going to side with Bay Street, as usual, or will they finally listen to Quebeckers who are saying that enough is enough? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that middle-class Canadians pay their fair share of taxes, but some wealthy individuals participate in complex tax schemes to avoid paying their fair share. EOS BOS This is unacceptable. EOS BOS That is why the government has made historic investments in the Canada Revenue Agency, specifically, $444 million in 2016 and $524 million in 2017. EOS BOS Over the past year, our government has managed to recover $13 billion. EOS BOS We are working hard, we are living up to our commitments, and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Employment has alluded to what he might be doing for the plant workers in Leamington. EOS BOS Is the government going to do anything for the farmers who have invested over $1,500 for every acre of tomatoes and have no market for their tomatoes next year? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are a number of things. EOS BOS Of course we have a full suite of business risk management programs for farmers such as that. EOS BOS We continue, with the Minister of International Trade and the Prime Minister, tracking down these great trade opportunities around the world. EOS BOS We continue to work on behalf of farmers in both those events. EOS BOS I know the member from Chatham has had farm round tables talking about other alternatives for those farmers, and I have attended some of them down in his area. EOS BOS They trust this government to have their best interests at heart. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is obvious with the OAS fiasco that the government failed to do its homework once again. EOS BOS The money is there. EOS BOS The Parliamentary Budget Officer has spoken. EOS BOS Today— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Newton—North Delta has the floor and members need to allow her to put the question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, homework is always necessary and my colleagues should do theirs. EOS BOS Today we hear reports that the government is looking to close trade offices and consulates in the United States. EOS BOS The Prime Minister, who is in China, is turning a blind eye to the potential problems with our closest trading partner. EOS BOS Looking for new trading opportunities should not come at the cost of undermining our current relationship with the U.S. Why is the government so shortsighted? EOS BOS Why close these offices just as they are getting off the ground? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is pure speculation. EOS BOS As of yet, no decision has been made. EOS BOS Foreign Affairs and Canadian diplomats around the world will continue to do Canada proud by protecting Canada's interests and promoting Canadian values. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the government is failing Canadian businesses and is lacking a coherent vision. EOS BOS The Conservatives claim that their recent actions are meant to strengthen trade ties with the U.S. How can this be when closing these offices will create instability for Canadian businesses? EOS BOS These offices not only provide crucial services for businesses, but they also help Canadians travelling and living in the U.S. EOS BOS Will the minister explain to Canadians why these important services are being compromised? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to get it straight what the member is saying. EOS BOS The New Democrats are now saying that we should be promoting trade ties with the U.S.A. when they were the ones opposing the Keystone pipeline. EOS BOS They will need to make up their minds as to what they want to do. EOS BOS However, as I said before, what she said is pure speculation. EOS BOS As of yet, no decision has been made. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the drop in gas prices and the resulting devaluation of the Canadian dollar clearly show that the health of Canada's economy is closely linked to natural resource development and that Canada is unfortunately caught in a trap of circular logic and would do well to diversify its sources of revenue. EOS BOS That being said, how can the government ignore the proposals that would allow Canada Post to have better revenues and thereby contribute to our collective assets? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member will know, Canada Post is experiencing a major transformation in its business case, not unlike postal agencies all around the world. EOS BOS People are changing their modes of communication, and as a result Canada Post delivered 1.2 billion fewer letters in 2013 than it did in only 2006. EOS BOS The result of this is a financial crisis at Canada Post, one that it is addressing with a five-point plan. EOS BOS I encourage the member to support Canada Post's efforts. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that private companies are trying to put themselves in a favourable position to take over Canada Post's home delivery service, suggesting that this service, which the public appreciates, can be profitable. EOS BOS In their efforts to radically transform the government and its public services, the Conservatives will soon be leaving the people of Terrebonne and Mascouche without home mail delivery service. EOS BOS How is the Conservatives' market transformation of crown corporations going to benefit the general public? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would remind the member that Canada Post is an independent, arm's-length crown corporation with a responsibility to operate in a fiscally sustainable way. EOS BOS It has a five-point plan, taking measures to return the corporation to a sound business case, getting its revenues back in line. EOS BOS While she is fighting for door-to-door delivery for one-third of Canadians, it is fighting to preserve daily mail for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the last report from Environment Canada confirms what Canadians have known for years. EOS BOS Under the Conservatives, serious action on climate change is a fantasy. EOS BOS In fact, the Conservatives are further than ever from meeting their own weakened emissions targets. EOS BOS In other words, even after they moved the goalposts, they still cannot score. EOS BOS Does the government intend to take immediate corrective action or does the minister still doubt climate change? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to achieving Canada's targets, and our leadership and actions prove this. EOS BOS We introduced new emissions regulations for vehicles and we are the first major coal user to ban construction of traditional coal-fired plants. EOS BOS Thanks to our actions, carbon emissions will go down close to 130 megatonnes from what they would have been under the Liberals. EOS BOS We are accomplishing this without the NDP carbon tax, which would raise the price of everything. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, “not even close” is what Environment Canada's report says about the Conservatives' prospects of reaching their 2020 greenhouse gas reduction targets. EOS BOS What is worse is that we are taking a step backward. EOS BOS At this rate, by 2015 their record will be just as bad as the Liberals. EOS BOS Enough with the nonsense. EOS BOS When will the minister announce reduction targets for the oil and gas sector to get the polluters to start doing their part? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we introduced new emission regulations for vehicles, and we are the first major country to reduce coal-fired power plants. EOS BOS Thanks to our actions, carbon emissions will go down close to 130 megatonnes, unlike what they would have been under the Liberal government. EOS BOS Unlike the NDP who thinks we can tax our way out of every problem, we are getting results without having to impose a carbon tax. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, one day the minister might understand the consequences of the government's inaction when it comes to fighting climate change. EOS BOS I think one of the saddest examples is the gradual disappearance of beluga whales from the St. Lawrence. EOS BOS Climate change has caused the population of this marine mammal to drop by 12% in the past decade. EOS BOS This emblem of Quebec could even be put on the list of endangered species in the next few months. EOS BOS What concrete measures is the minister going to take to fight climate change and save the belugas? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has taken action to address climate change. EOS BOS We are a founding member of an international coalition taking action to reduce pollutants like black carbon, and we have made it a priority under the Arctic Council. EOS BOS These actions are seeing real results for Canadians without killing the economy, like the opposition wants to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister does not get it. EOS BOS The Conservatives' attacks on science are preventing us from properly monitoring changes in the beluga population in the St. Lawrence. EOS BOS Are the belugas victims of an epidemic? EOS BOS Are toxic algae responsible for the population's decline? EOS BOS We do not know, and because of the Conservatives' cuts to the St. Lawrence research program, we will likely never know. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives restore the funding and the beluga research station that they cut? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, researchers from DFO have been working with partners to study the beluga whales in the St. Lawrence. EOS BOS A scientific peer review meeting was held to review the knowledge on the state of the population, and that peer-reviewed science advice will be published in the coming months. EOS BOS We will continue to conduct research on marine mammals in co-operation with all of our partners. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Minister of Democratic Institutions is actually interested in having a conversation on electoral reform, she cannot just keep repeating random verbs and nouns. EOS BOS She actually has to listen. EOS BOS Consultation, conversation, and listening are all great nouns and verbs. EOS BOS However, I have a noun for the Liberals: referendum. EOS BOS The Canadian people deserve one. EOS BOS Will the Liberals finally commit to one? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we continue to believe that listening to Canadians is our priority as members, but also my priority as Minister of Democratic Institutions. EOS BOS It is our responsibility, as a House, to ensure that the voices of our constituents are heard. EOS BOS I am looking forward to this conversation happening in this House in a meaningful and respectful way beginning tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it seems that the minister is confused about how conversations work. EOS BOS Both parties get to participate; the Liberals cannot just dictate the result. EOS BOS The only person who is taking away from the conversation is the minister, by following the Prime Minister's preconceived notion of where he wants the consultations to arrive. EOS BOS If the Liberals truly wanted to listen, they would let each and every Canadian have a say through a referendum. EOS BOS Will the Liberals drop the act already? EOS BOS Referendum, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for this conversation. EOS BOS We listened to Canadians. EOS BOS Over 60% said that we need to review other options and we need to move beyond the status quo. EOS BOS We committed to bringing forward a committee made up of all parties of this House to review the options available, including online voting, including mandatory voting. EOS BOS I am looking forward to continuing a meaningful and respectful dialogue among all parties. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the minister told the House that I had a hard time with the concept of listening, so just for the fun of it I spent a few minutes Googling quotes from reputable political analysts across Canada. EOS BOS Here is what I found: “ EOS BOS [The minister] has so far succeeded in burning bridges where she should have been building some.” “ EOS BOS It is an unsustainable proposition.” “ EOS BOS The Liberals were responsible for reassuring their political opponents. EOS BOS The Prime Minister did exactly the opposite.” EOS BOS Clearly, I am not the only one who has a listening problem. EOS BOS I invite the minister to hold a referendum and consult Canadians. EOS BOS We will see which side of the House has a real listening problem. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for the media. EOS BOS I believe nothing is more important to democracy than a well-informed electorate. EOS BOS I also believe we need to listen to those whose voices have not been included in this conversation, like those with disabilities and exceptionalities, representatives of which groups we met with earlier. EOS BOS What we are hearing from people with disabilities is that the path to voting is an obstacle course. EOS BOS Let us listen to these voices and improve our electoral system and the way people vote. EOS BOS An hon. EOS BOS member: Shame. EOS
BOS I am going to ask the member for Brantford— EOS BOS Brant not to speak when someone else has the floor. EOS BOS He knows better than that, and we all do. EOS BOS Most members are able to hear things they do not like and disagree with them without reacting. EOS BOS That is what we should all do because we are all adults. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Richmond—Arthabaska. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is lecturing us about partisanship in the House; this is the same minister who thinks that her tweets count as consultation and who set up a committee that is under the complete control of the Liberal party, without consultation. EOS BOS After all that, the minister has the audacity to tell us here in the House that the opposition is being partisan. EOS BOS Seriously, will the minister finally listen to Canadians? EOS BOS Will she commit to holding a referendum so that all Canadians can express their views? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have committed to bringing together a committee made up of all parties to review the various options available to us. EOS BOS The purpose of this committee coming together is to hear from Canadians first-hand, and, yes, using 21st century tools like social media is smart and necessary for us to ensure that all voices, as many voices as possible, are included in this conversation. EOS BOS I am looking forward to a respectful and meaningful dialogue with all parties. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister justified the government's hiring of a communications advisor who is a professional advocate for a ranked ballot system, on the irrelevant basis that he was not hired for being a Liberal. EOS BOS That, of course, is not the issue. EOS BOS He was hired because he is an advocate of the ranked ballot system. EOS BOS Why, when the different proposals have not even been submitted and the committee has not even been struck, is the Liberal Party already hiring someone who has a position? EOS BOS Why are the Liberals putting in the fix before the process is even started? EOS BOS Why will they not allow a referendum? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite knows quite well that this individual was hired by the Privy Council to work as a communications advisor as a member of Canada's non-partisan public service. EOS BOS We are proud of the professional, non-partisan public service whose members come to work day in and day out with the sole purpose of serving Canadians. EOS BOS I encourage the member opposite to consider doing the same. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is mistaken that the role of the Privy Council and the role of the public service is to be non-biased. EOS BOS It is, however, to represent what the government wants. EOS BOS What the government wants, apparently, is to have a single member district preferential ballot system. EOS BOS I will ask the question again. EOS BOS Why did the Liberals hire an individual to communicate on behalf of ranked ballots? EOS BOS What possible reason could the Liberals have, unless they have already predetermined the outcome of this entire process. EOS BOS Is that why they do not want to allow Canadians to engage in a referendum? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the member's question, and I would like to reassure him that what we committed to, and the only outcome that we have arrived at to this point, is bringing together parliamentarians in this place to review the options available to us. EOS BOS I know this is a difficult concept for the member opposite to grasp. EOS BOS I know there is lingering cynicism from the Conservatives' practices over the last decade. EOS BOS That is not the way we do things, and I am looking forward to us realizing that, all of us together— EOS </s> BOS I know members do not want to question the intelligence of members here. EOS BOS We have a very intelligent group, all 337, and then there is me, but that is another matter. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Abitibi—Témiscamingue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to protecting supply management, there was no clear and reassuring message from the Prime Minister  on his trip to Washington or when he left for Europe. EOS BOS What is worse, there are several indications that there will be more hits to our supply management system. EOS BOS With 17,700 tonnes of fine cheeses entering Canada and ridiculously inadequate compensation, are we to understand that the Liberal government will be sacrificing our supply management system, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are proud to invest $350 million in assistance for dairy producers and artisanal cheese makers to modernize and improve their long-term competitiveness. EOS BOS These programs will help dairy producers and processors adapt to the increase in cheese imports from the European Union under the agreement. EOS BOS As a result of comments made during consultations of the dairy sector, programs were developed to make strategic investments in the dairy industry and increase the efficiency of our competitive productivity under the supply management system. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the member for Ottawa Centre took time away from his own riding responsibilities yesterday to join a group of career protesters who oppose the expansion of CFB Trenton. EOS BOS Clearly, the opposition does not support job creation and economic growth. EOS BOS Could the minister inform the House of the impact the CFB expansion will have in terms of economic prosperity for the citizens of Quinte West? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Northumberland—Quinte West for that excellent question. EOS BOS In May 2010, the municipal council of Quinte West unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the acquisition of all lands required for the relocation of the Joint Task Force. EOS BOS With hundreds of families moving to the region, this project will inject millions of dollars into the local economy and boost local business. EOS BOS Most importantly, it will give our special operations forces the resources they need to get the job done for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this weekend I met with an 86-year-old farmer and his supporters. EOS BOS His name is Frank Meyers. EOS BOS The Department of National Defence is going to take away his farm, his land. EOS BOS This land has been with his family since before Confederation. EOS BOS Although the law may allow the government to do it, Mr. Meyers' land is precious to the history of our country, to our farmland, and to making sure we have food security. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives going to just take this land away from an 86-year-old farmer and turn their backs on this man and his community, yes or no? EOS BOS Otherwise, are they going to reconsider what I think is an ill-fated, not very wise decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meyers will be fairly compensated and will be allowed to continue to live in his home, which has been specifically exempted from that process. EOS BOS I appreciate that this is not the member's constituency, but if it were, he would probably be aware that this process has the unanimous consent of the local council, which wants to support our men and women in uniform who need these facilities. EOS BOS This is why it has widespread support in that area. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today on the Hill we are joined by laid off port workers who came all the way from Churchill to fight for our port. EOS BOS The closure of the port is devastating for Churchill and for our north. EOS BOS What is the Liberal record? EOS BOS The Liberals privatized it and are doing nothing to re-open it. EOS BOS This is about standing up for our country. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister stand up to the American billionaire who is holding Churchill and our north for ransom. EOS BOS When will he stand up for Churchill, for our north and for Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a very important file. EOS BOS That is why I am working with my colleagues from Manitoba. EOS BOS I visited Churchill. EOS BOS I had an opportunity to meet with the northern delegation and have a town hall session with members of the community to hear their concerns, and put forward a plan going forward. EOS BOS That plan includes $4.6 million for regional economic development. EOS BOS We are focusing on tourism, Arctic research. EOS BOS We are looking at ways to diversify the economy, create jobs and opportunities. EOS BOS Churchill is important for the north and it is important for Canada. EOS BOS Our government is committed to that region. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the government for its response. EOS BOS Last week, Royal Bank apologized for the temporary foreign worker situation, but the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism—who approved this improper use of the program, which led to the dismissal of Canadian workers—still refuses to take responsibility. EOS BOS What mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the temporary foreign worker program can no longer be used to squeeze out Canadian workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on May 2, 2011, Canadians gave us a mandate to govern this country and create jobs for Canadians. EOS BOS That is what we are doing. EOS BOS Canada is the top G7 country when it comes to employment. EOS BOS The concerns about this program are serious. EOS BOS That is why budget 2013 contains reforms that will enable us to talk about these issues, develop policies, make investments and take the steps necessary to create jobs for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year, based on a recommendation of a government committee stacked with Conservative members and lobbyists, the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism launched a new fast-track approval process for temporary foreign workers. EOS BOS His process is being used to replace skilled Canadian workers with temporary foreign workers. EOS BOS It is no accident. EOS BOS This is what the Conservatives wanted. EOS BOS Why did the Conservatives create a process that makes it easier to replace Canadian workers with temporary foreign workers? EOS BOS That is the question. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what is very strange about these questions from the New Democrats is that they say on the one hand that they want his program to be shut down, but on the other hand, every day after question period, we have a steady parade of New Democrat members of Parliament over to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and over to the Minister of Human Resources asking for special treatment to bring temporary foreign workers into NDP constituencies. EOS BOS We have letters from eight NDP members of Parliament who have asked for temporary foreign workers to be brought in to their constituencies. EOS BOS We have many more New Democrats who say one thing in the House, but when question period is over, they come over here and ask that we continue and enlarge the temporary foreign worker program for them. “ EOS BOS Do as I say, not as I do” is the policy of the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government's new accelerated approval process, its term, for temporary foreign workers was supposed to specifically target highly skilled workers. EOS BOS In fact, it has been used to hire workers at gas stations, convenience stores and fast food restaurants. EOS BOS The program has been used to hire workers at Tim Hortons, McDonald's, Subway and A&W. What special skill set was the minister looking for? EOS BOS Sandwich artists, servers on roller skates? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, to the substance of the question, if the leader of the NDP actually wants to have a serious debate on this subject, it would be great if he would support budget 2013 where we actually will move forward with reforms that are necessary both to the temporary foreign worker program and also to do what job creators across the country are calling for, which is an approach by the Government of Canada, focused with those who are actually creating jobs, with the Canada job grant so we can partner with them to fill those spots that are not being filled right now by Canadians. EOS BOS We want to ensure we have full-time, well-paying jobs for Canadians. EOS BOS We have the programs and proposals in budget 2013 to make it happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year the Conservatives missed their own economic growth targets by 35%. EOS BOS Last month, the Canadian economy lost nearly 55,000 jobs. EOS BOS Today, the IMF has downgraded Canada's economic outlook yet again. EOS BOS Instead of taking action, Conservatives are slashing $6 billion in infrastructure funding and killing tens of thousands of jobs. EOS BOS Instead of investing in job creation, they are killing venture capital funds. EOS BOS That is in the budget the member just referred to. EOS BOS The only job plan the Conservatives have is to bring in more temporary foreign workers. EOS BOS That is the problem. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is ridiculous. EOS BOS Canada has the best job record in all of the G7. EOS BOS If they want to compare apples to apples, plan to plan, we put forward our economic action plan 2013, and Canada has the best job numbers in all of the G7. EOS BOS Over 900,000 net new jobs have been created since the worst part of the recession. EOS BOS What was the NDP plan? EOS BOS It was tabled by the finance critic for the NDP. EOS BOS It contains no numbers, no proposals, expression of sentiment but no actual ideas to move this country forward. EOS BOS All we hear from the NDP, time and time again, rhetorically, is the need to raise taxes and spend more money. EOS BOS We stand on the side of consumers and job creators to build a strong national economy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, New Brunswickers and Canadians across the country want to help the people of Fort McMurray in northeastern Alberta who are still suffering from the tragic forest fires. EOS BOS With Base Gagetown in the riding I represent, I am reminded daily that the women and men of the Canadian Forces are no exception. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence update this House on the contributions being made by the Canadian Forces to the firefighting efforts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Fredericton for his concern and his question. EOS BOS Aid to civil authority is one of the key responsibilities of the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS The joint task force transported 367 evacuees to safety and 173 firefighters in and out of the affected area. EOS BOS The air task force conducted one search and rescue mission, eight reconnaissance flights, and eight night surveillance flights. EOS BOS I want to thank the men and women who took part in this effort, and I am happy to say that they all returned safely. EOS BOS Canadians know that when the Canadian Forces are needed, they will be there for them. EOS
BOS There are five minutes remaining in questions and comments after the speech of the hon. EOS BOS member for York—Simcoe. EOS BOS The hon. parliamentary secretary to the government House leader. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to make it very clear that the government members within the Liberal caucus understand the importance of having unfettered access to the parliamentary precinct. EOS BOS The parliamentary precinct includes the offices of members of Parliament, the House of Commons here for a vote or a debate, and the committees on the Hill and in the many different offices off the Hill itself. EOS BOS There is no doubt about that. EOS BOS Having said that, there is some concern, if we listen to what the mover and the seconder of the motion had to say about it, in terms of what is motivating it. EOS BOS This is, as I expressed earlier, that we should not in any way whatsoever be attempting to politicize this very important principle, which is indeed a privilege. EOS BOS Would the member across the way not agree with me? EOS BOS Would we get the commitment from the member that in no fashion would the member participate in something that would politicize this? EOS BOS After all, we all understand and appreciate that unfettered access. EOS BOS Will the member join me by making that statement? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat puzzled by the question, and I am not sure what the member is driving at. EOS BOS The motion is that this matter be studied by the committee, and the amendment is that the motion should have priority over other business of the procedure and House affairs committee. EOS BOS In fact, it is an amendment to the motion that parallels exactly what the rules of this place are, which is that an issue of this matter takes precedence. EOS BOS The amendment is asking that it take precedence as well at the committee that deals with such business. EOS BOS Essentially, it is recreating in the committee the same philosophy, approach, and rules here. EOS BOS I do not understand how that is partisan. EOS BOS I know the hon. EOS BOS member knows something of partisanship. EOS BOS I know that because I have been reading through some things he has said in the past five years, and his positions are 180 degrees opposite of the positions he takes nowadays. EOS BOS That suggests to me, if nothing else, partisanship if one can have one set of views on this side and views that are 180 degrees opposite on the other side. EOS BOS Certainly the question of the rights of a member to vote should be considered paramount. EOS BOS The reason it is considered partisan by some of us over here is that we hear members from the Liberal Party saying, as we heard here, that this should not go to the committee, that this should not have priority and that we should let it be dealt with by officials and put it off into the shadows somewhere and leave members out of it, to “leave it to us, trust us”. EOS BOS That, to me, sounds a bit dangerous. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, my hon. EOS BOS colleague focused on how voting is one of the most important things we do in this House. EOS BOS We are going to be voting next week, and if people can be impeded from coming and doing that, which is the most important thing, that seems to me to be a priority as well. EOS BOS I wonder if the member could comment on what the consequences would be if this does not get immediate attention at PROC. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is referring to the fact that right now the procedure and House affairs committee is dealing with other business that is very much of a long-term nature. EOS BOS It is the kind of stuff that is generally the subject of study. EOS BOS In fact, we hear the government say it has no particular proposals. EOS BOS We fear it does have particular proposals in mind. EOS BOS It will not commit that it will agree to any kind of unified approach here. EOS BOS It seems to me there are a lot of discussions still to be had there. EOS BOS However, we are not going to be changing the rules next week, but we will be having votes next week, so the question of what we need to do to ensure we do not have a repetition of the unfortunate event is important. EOS BOS This is the first time we will be considering this issue in this particular context, where security is a question under the new unified Parliamentary Protective Service that was supposed to solve these problems from happening again, as they had in the past. EOS BOS Clearly, the design that was created by the experts, with the best of intentions, and I think they all do good work, that was supposed to solve the problem did not do it. EOS BOS That is why parliamentarians, all of us, have to take responsibility for ensuring all of our rights are properly protected, particularly the rights of minorities, but every individual member. EOS BOS That is an urgent and priority matter. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government firmly believes and agrees with the opposition that any instances of a member being impeded from attending the House of Commons, particularly for a vote, is an extremely serious situation that needs to be studied in detail. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning you ruled that you believe there are sufficient grounds for finding a prima facie question of privilege. EOS BOS We support your findings. EOS BOS The House has debated this important issue today, and I want to thank all members for their important contributions to this debate. EOS BOS However, I would like to draw to the attention of members what the consequences are of what the Conservatives have done with their amendment to their own motion. EOS BOS Their amendment seeks to direct the procedure and House affairs committee to drop whatever else it is working on. EOS BOS This amendment is highly unusual, and it has one purpose: to stop the procedure and House affairs committee from continuing the debate on the important issue of how we modernize the House of Commons. EOS BOS Our members on the committee have been hoping to debate the substance of these ideas, and this Conservative amendment is an attempt to block this important work. EOS BOS We will not allow the Conservatives to play politics with the rights and privileges of members of Parliament. EOS BOS This is just too important. EOS BOS We will also not let them try to block a study on how we modernize the rules of the House of Commons. EOS BOS During the election campaign, we committed to modernizing Parliament and making it a 21st century workplace. EOS BOS As a direct result of the Harper government's approach to Parliament over the past 10 years, we promised Canadians we would bring a new approach to Ottawa to ensure their voices were also heard in this place. EOS BOS We will not allow the Conservatives to play politics with the rights and privileges of members of Parliament. EOS BOS This is just too important. EOS BOS Therefore, the Liberal member for Hamilton West—Ancaster—Dundas, who is a member of the procedure and House affairs committee, has today given notice of a motion that reads as follows: “ EOS BOS That, the committee examine the question of privilege raised by the member for Milton respecting the free movement of members within the parliamentary precinct.” EOS BOS We look forward to this important debate at committee. EOS BOS I believe we must now return to debating the important legislation scheduled for today, Bill C-25, which would help increase shareholder democracy and participation, and increase women's participation on corporate boards and in senior management. EOS BOS Therefore, I move:
              Motion
              
                
                  That the House do now proceed to Orders of the Day. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and the other resource-rich regions in Quebec, the forestry industry is struggling. EOS BOS Mills need investments and jobs are precarious. EOS BOS Modernizing the industry is the key, but the Conservative government is not doing enough to build the forestry industry of the future. EOS BOS Will the government immediately renew the forest sector research and development initiative previously offered by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and replenish funding for the investments in forest industry transformation program? EOS BOS According to the Forest Products Association of Canada, the industry needs $500 million over six years. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have given more support to the forestry sector than any other government in the history of Canada. EOS BOS We are investing in innovation, but the NDP rejected our plan. EOS BOS Our focus on innovation, energy efficiency and market expansion has paid off remarkably for the forestry sector. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP has launched a study of the forestry sector at the natural resources committee, one that is so important to so many communities in northern Ontario and across the country. EOS BOS We have lost more than 100,000 forestry jobs under the Conservatives' watch. EOS BOS Many forestry towns are in crisis. EOS BOS The government support for industry transformation is drying up. EOS BOS Will the minister commit to ensuring there is new support for forestry in the upcoming budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have and we will continue, and he will continue to vote against it. EOS BOS In northwestern Ontario alone we have seen no less than five or six mills either open for the first time or reopen. EOS BOS People are getting jobs in this sector. EOS BOS Woodland operators are back to work. EOS BOS All the member does, and the NDP members from northern Ontario do, is vote against every one of these initiatives. EOS BOS People who work in the forest sector know that, and they will hold them accountable for it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are hearing from band members across this country who want to know that the Prime Minister's $8.4 billion in the budget is going to have a real meaningful impact on their lives. EOS BOS We are also hearing that they are very concerned about the gutting of the First Nations Financial Transparency Act. EOS BOS When the Liberals refuse to allow first nations to access spending information on reserves, it does impact their lives. EOS BOS Why will the Liberals not allow first nations community members to have the same access to information of all Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member well knows that members of first nations communities do have access to all the audited statements. EOS BOS If they do not have access, they can get that straight from my office, and those requests are very, very rare. EOS BOS That was the reason we opposed the act, because first nations had not been consulted. EOS BOS We all want accountability. EOS BOS We just cannot do it top-down. EOS
BOS The Chair has notice of a request for an emergency debate from the hon. EOS BOS member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as per my letter to you, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I request leave to make a motion to discuss actions the government can take to address the human rights situation facing Uighur Muslims in China, specifically in light of threats to religious liberty that this community may face during Ramadan, starting June 6. EOS BOS The Uighur Muslim community living in the People's Republic of China faces significant human rights abuses. EOS BOS During Ramadan these abuses have included forcible prevention of people from engaging in this deeply important Muslim fast. EOS BOS In 2015, the Chinese government banned civil servants, students, and teachers in the Xinjiang region, where most Uighurs live, from fasting during Ramadan. EOS BOS It also ordered restaurants to stay open. EOS BOS On January 1, new “ EOS BOS Enforcement of Religious Affairs Regulations" came into effect in the region, with the professed goal of limiting the role of religion in “marriage, funerals, culture, the arts, and sports". EOS BOS Again this year, counties have posted notices forbidding students and Communist Party members from participating in the Ramadan fast. EOS BOS The Chinese government is paying attention to what we in Canada say and do not say on these issues. EOS BOS We in this House, the government, and you, Mr. Speaker, can make a difference for these suffering people by using this opportunity to discuss the role we can play in response to this situation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have failed in their responsibility to sit down on a nation-to-nation basis to negotiate and implement a comprehensive land claim for the Métis in Labrador. EOS BOS This should come as no surprise. EOS BOS The government has allowed claims to languish for years without progress or resolution. EOS BOS Denying aboriginal people greater control over their futures is just wrong. EOS BOS Will the minister commit today to immediately begin negotiating the NunatuKavut claim, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, to put it politely, it takes some gall. EOS BOS This claim was laid down in 1991 under a Conservative government and in 1992—Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Aboriginal Affairs has the floor. EOS BOS He has barely started his response and still has lots of time left. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Aboriginal Affairs has the floor. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact, I said this claim was laid on the table in 1991, and for the better part of 13 years that the Liberals were in office, they did nothing with it and today they have the gall to stand and call for action while they are sitting in the third place. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the past week, over 50 people have been arrested for protesting Kinder Morgan's test drilling on Burnaby Mountain, and this includes the arrest this weekend of two 11-year-old girls. EOS BOS These are not radicals; they are regular people who rightly feel shut out of the flawed process to review this pipeline. EOS BOS They have no faith in the environmental review process that was gutted by these Conservatives. EOS BOS Why has the government deliberately set up a process that is primed for this kind of conflict? EOS BOS Let us not pretend that the NEB process is any more than a sham. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we respect the right of Canadians to peaceful protest; however, the rule of law must be followed. EOS BOS This project will undergo a rigorous science- and fact-based review by the National Energy Board. EOS BOS The board must hear from those who are directly affected by a proposed project and may choose to hear from those with relevant expertise on the project. EOS BOS Again, we have been clear: projects will only proceed if they are safe for Canadians and safe for the environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's process involves arresting people. EOS BOS It actually should involve consulting Canadians. EOS BOS This is about getting development right, not doing it at any cost. EOS BOS The Conservatives do not seem to believe in social licence. EOS BOS They think it is an ideological term. EOS BOS They should tell that to the folks who are on Burnaby Mountain right now. EOS BOS With no real, credible evaluation process, arresting people is not going to give projects like Kinder Morgan's social licence.Why has the government so thoroughly and completely broken trust with the public on energy project review? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the National Energy Board is a robust, independent regulatory body that conducts a rigorous science- and fact-based review on projects. EOS BOS As I said, the board must hear from those who are directly affected by a proposed project and may choose to hear from those who have relevant expertise on the matter. EOS BOS Again, we have been clear: these projects will not proceed if they are not safe for Canadians and not safe for the environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2010, Eddie Snowshoe of Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories, committed suicide in the Edmonton Institution's segregation unit. EOS BOS His mother still grieves. EOS BOS Though he had been diagnosed with mental health issues and as suicidal, he was in solitary confinement for 162 days straight. EOS BOS The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has stated that solitary confinement is contrary to one of the essential aims of the penitentiary system. EOS BOS How many more Eddie Snowshoe's will there be? EOS BOS How many more deaths will it take before this minister takes some action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, every death in custody is taken seriously and there is always an inquiry. EOS BOS Let me comment on a procedure that is done in all western countries, called administrative segregation. EOS BOS It is done for safety reasons: the safety of the inmate, the safety of the personnel, and the safety of the facility. EOS BOS This procedure is applied with a lot of common sense by our correctional officers. EOS BOS We expect to have more development of our mental health strategy, an action we have taken to make sure that those who have serious mental health issues are well taken care of. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is way simpler than that. EOS BOS This minister needs to stop putting the mentally ill in solitary confinement and start getting them the treatment they need. EOS BOS It has now been almost a year since the inquest into Ashley Smith's death. EOS BOS That inquest made 104 recommendations to prevent similar tragedies. EOS BOS We have heard nothing from the minister by way of response. EOS BOS How many more tragedies will it take before the minister does respond? EOS BOS When will he put an end to the use of solitary confinement for the treatment of the mentally ill in Canadian prisons? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleague to read through the action plan that we implemented more than six months ago. I can send the press release to him. EOS BOS First and foremost, I would like to say that we have put processes in place to assess and screen inmates as soon as they arrive. EOS BOS Staff have received training. EOS BOS Inmates are medically monitored at all stages as soon as they are identified as having mental health issues. EOS BOS It is something that we are taking seriously. EOS BOS I look forward to seeing how Correctional Service Canada will respond to the coroner's report on the tragic death of Ashley Smith. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for a year we have been waiting for the Conservatives to take action and respond to the recommendations from the inquiry into the tragic death of Ashley Smith, but the minister prefers to continue to avoid the question. EOS BOS In the meantime, tragic mistakes keep happening. EOS BOS People like Edward Snowshoe continue to be put in solitary confinement. EOS BOS How many more inmates with mental health issues will have to die before the Minister of Public Safety finally takes action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, administrative segregation is a practice that is used in prisons in western countries. EOS BOS It is done for the safety of the inmate, the safety of the personnel, and the safety of the facility. EOS BOS As for the report from Correctional Service Canada in response to the coroner's recommendations, I expect it to be delivered very soon. EOS BOS However, that has not stopped us from implementing many measures in the meantime. EOS BOS We have a five-point action plan that is designed to help us treat people who, ideally, would not be in prison but in a hospital. EOS BOS We will ensure that they receive proper treatment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, honeybee health is essential to a strong agricultural sector in Canada. EOS BOS The National Bee Diagnostic Centre in Beaverlodge has done great work in providing bee diagnostics and promoting bee health. EOS BOS Since the founding of this important institution, the demand for their services from beekeepers across the country has grown exponentially and they have nearly outgrown their current facilities. EOS BOS Will the minister commit today to work with the National Bee Diagnostic Centre to ensure that they can expand and continue their important work and research on bee health? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question. EOS BOS Honeybee health makes an essential contribution to the success of many agricultural sectors. EOS BOS Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is working with the industry and its provincial partners on research into bee health and viability. EOS BOS The department has also funded projects to improve the competitiveness of the bee industry. EOS BOS I am excited by the idea of working with our partners to find ways to improve bee health. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the free trade agreement with Europe is important to Quebec. EOS BOS Our role is to be the bridge between North America and Europe. EOS BOS However, the government's intransigence is standing in the way. EOS BOS Now the Walloons are worried about certain provisions of the agreement that could allow multinationals to impede the sovereignty of states. EOS BOS Those fears warrant further attention. EOS BOS Instead of slamming the door, could the Minister of International Trade not remain open and continue the negotiations until a deal can be reached? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the deal had stalled under the previous government and we got it back on track. EOS BOS It is now supported by 27.5 of the 28 member states of Europe. EOS BOS As the President of the European Parliament said, “...it's quite clear that the problems on the table are European problems”. EOS BOS Canada has done its job, and now it is up to Europe to do its part. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, she should never have been there. EOS BOS [Translation]Canadians who follow the rules and pay their taxes find the Panama papers scandal disgusting. EOS BOS This week we learned that a former senior Revenue Canada official left the agency and went to work for KPMG when the firm was being investigated by Revenue Canada for using tax havens. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister finally conduct an investigation and lock the revolving door at Revenue Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians expect that no one should be able to avoid paying their fair share of taxes by giving money or doing favours. EOS BOS For that reason, our budget includes a $440-million investment so that the Canada Revenue Agency can recover money lost as a result of tax avoidance and evasion. EOS BOS The reality is that we must support the Canada Revenue Agency as it works to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have a Minister of Justice attending a sketchy fundraiser, a Minister of Finance with companies registered in tax havens like the Bahamas, and a Minister of National Revenue who is defending sweetheart deals for millionaire tax cheats. EOS BOS The Liberals swore they would be different, but they keep finding novel ways of being the Liberals. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister show he is serious about cracking down on tax havens by ordering an investigation into KPMG's secret deal? EOS BOS He just talked about what is in the budget. EOS BOS Let us see some action now. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, $440 million to the Canada Revenue Agency, in terms of going after tax evasion and avoidance, is significant action. EOS BOS We have committed to make sure that nobody gets to avoid taxes by paying a little money on the side. EOS BOS We need to make sure that we have an open, fair, responsible system of taxation that is properly enforced. EOS BOS That is what Canadians expect of their government. EOS BOS That is the kind of openness, transparency, and rigour that this government is delivering. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, section 18 of the Canada Elections Act states:The Chief Electoral Officer may, using any...means that he or she considers appropriate, provide the public...with information relating to Canada’s electoral process, the democratic right to vote and how to be a candidate. EOS BOS The Conservatives are removing that section. EOS BOS This bill was supposed to target widespread election fraud during the last election, so why are they using it to stop the CEO from talking to the media? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member has made a factual error in her question. EOS BOS Section 18 of the existing act deals with promotional advertising by Elections Canada and has absolutely nothing to do with communicating allegations of wrongdoing. EOS BOS Sections 534 and 535, not section 18, require the CEO to report to the House of Commons on electoral events and any matters that arise from them. EOS BOS These automatically become public and the fair elections act does not change that. EOS BOS Furthermore, the CEO will still have the ability to report any allegations he wishes to the commissioner, who has a legal responsibility to enforce the act. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister should read his actual bill, not the imaginary one that he uses to— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Vancouver East has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when we look at the actual bill, it does limit the Chief Electoral Officer's access to the media. EOS BOS Clause 7 of the bill severely limits what the CEO can talk about. EOS BOS For example, the minister is banning the head of Elections Canada from talking about the state of Canada's voting system. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives using this bill to put a gag order on Elections Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, clause 7 amends section 18, which has absolutely nothing to do with the reporting of allegations of wrongdoing. EOS BOS Section 18 deals with advertising. EOS BOS The last time I checked, Elections Canada does not combat or report allegations by purchasing advertising. EOS BOS It reports allegations to the House of Commons, something that is not only allowed under the fair elections act but will continue to be required of it. EOS BOS Furthermore, the CEO will still have the legal ability to report any allegations to the chief investigator, who is the Commissioner of Canada Elections. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. EOS BOS Under the government's law, the Chief Electoral Officer's scrum outside committee yesterday would now be illegal. EOS BOS That is ridiculous. EOS BOS Potential voters with no fixed address or government-issued ID will now find it harder to vote. EOS BOS First nations, young people, and lower income Canadians will be hurt. EOS BOS Elections Canada is banned from doing public outreach aimed at encouraging more people to vote. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives using changes to the elections act to make it harder for people to vote? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, we are making it easier to vote by giving them an extra voting day and allowing resources to reduce congestion at the polls so that voting is faster for Canadians. EOS BOS Furthermore, we are requiring Elections Canada to communicate to people the basics of voting, where, when, and what ID to bring, and to inform disabled people of the special tools available to help them vote. EOS BOS All of the data show that these are the main obstacles to voting. EOS BOS We are going to remove these obstacles by focusing Elections Canada's advertising on the basics of voting and providing better customer service to voters. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the new bill allows local election campaign organizations to collect money from donors who have contributed at least $20 in the past without that counting as an election expense. EOS BOS However, this clause is impossible to apply because Elections Canada does not keep a list of donors who have contributed between $20 and $200. EOS BOS What makes the Conservatives think that they will be able to enforce this clause of the bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the limits in question in the bill seek to limit the amount of money spent on election campaigns and not the amount of money spent on fundraising in the first place. EOS BOS That is a reasonable change. EOS BOS In fact, that same rule applied during the Liberal Party leadership race. EOS BOS This is not new. EOS BOS It will be clearly indicated in the law. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is not very convincing. EOS BOS The reality is that the exemption clause favours the Conservative Party. EOS BOS The former chief electoral officer is against this measure. EOS BOS He maintains that this is a roundabout way of raising the limit on election spending. EOS BOS Obviously, this measure was introduced after a number of Conservative members and ministers were found guilty of exceeding the spending limit. EOS BOS Does the Conservative government realize that this measure is leaving the door wide open to abuse? EOS </s> BOS Quite the contrary, Mr. Speaker, the former electoral officer in fact gave the bill an overall A minus, which is pretty good, I think. EOS BOS The bill will actually now go to committee after the vote next week, at which point, we can work hard with the former CEO, many expert witnesses, and all parliamentarians to turn that A minus into an A plus. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, border services officers in my riding of Kootenay—Columbia and across Canada are some of our hardest-working law enforcement officers. EOS BOS Every day they protect our borders from illegal arms, drugs, and other smuggled goods. EOS BOS Despite their importance, the Liberal government, like the Conservative government before it, refuses to fairly negotiate a collective agreement with these officers. EOS BOS The government is demanding concessions from our border staff, and now talks have broken off. EOS BOS When will the Liberals get back to the bargaining table and treat our borders services officers fairly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Treasury Board is the bargaining agent on behalf of the Government of Canada. EOS BOS Those responsibilities are taken very seriously by the government to ensure that everyone who works for the Government of Canada is treated in a proper and appropriate way. EOS BOS Obviously the border guards who work for CBSA do a very important job, keeping this country safe and making sure that our borders are sound, secure, and efficient. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada is about to invest $35 billion in a maritime strategy that could create jobs in all shipyards across the country. EOS BOS What should be good news is worrying shipyard workers because foreign companies like BEA Systems want their piece of the pie. EOS BOS The NDP raised these concerns several times last winter. EOS BOS Can the government now confirm that Canadian shipyards will be the only beneficiaries, the only shipbuilders in this maritime strategy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when the government made the historic decision to build the ships that our navy and Coast Guard needed right here in Canada, what that meant was more than 75 million man hours of work for the shipbuilding industry and for the manufacturing sector over the coming decade. EOS BOS This is a competitive, open, transparent process between several shipyards. EOS BOS At the end of the day, two shipyards will be chosen to do a great deal of work on behalf of the shipbuilding industry, but there will be shipyards and manufacturing sectors all across this country that will benefit from those jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is just the problem. The government says, “Trust us on jobs, trust us on this file”, but the reality is that it has been playing politics with this issue. EOS BOS With this much money and jobs on the line, Canadians must see that there is a smart overall strategy that puts forward the strength of each of our shipbuilding regions in B.C., Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. EOS BOS Will the government stop the political games and look to use the strength of every shipbuilding region of our country in these contracts, so that all Canadians could benefit from this strategy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member well knows, the process that is under way is at arm's-length from the government through what is called the shipbuilding secretariat. EOS BOS We have created an open, fair, transparent and very competitive process. EOS BOS This process includes not only independent oversight provided by KPMG but also a fairness monitor and an international third party marine expert that is evaluating these bids to ensure the fairness, openness and transparency of the process. EOS BOS At the end of the day, this is a very competitive process. EOS BOS Again, this will create 75 million man hours of work across this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime, particularly violent and brutal murders that involve sexual assault and kidnapping. EOS BOS The justice system should do all it can to specifically denounce society's worst crimes. EOS BOS Yesterday, the member for Selkirk— EOS BOS Interlake received the government's support for his legislation, which would ensure that victims are not re-victimized by the justice system with repeat parole hearings. EOS BOS Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice please inform the House how Bill C-478, the respecting families of murdered and brutalized persons act, would further complement our government's support for victims? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, permit me to thank the hon. member for Northumberland—Quinte West for his great question and for his great contribution and work on the public safety committee. EOS BOS This legislation will give the judges discretion to increase parole ineligibility periods for the most violent and brutal murders in Canada. EOS BOS We think judges should have this discretion. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the NDP do not. EOS BOS Last night, the NDP indicated that it would oppose this bill. EOS BOS This is very disappointing but not surprising. EOS BOS After all, this is the same party that voted against repealing the faint hope clause. EOS BOS We will vote in favour of this bill because it is the right thing to do for victims of these horrible crimes. EOS BOS The NDP should do the same. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last year the Prime Minister committed to renewing the Crown-first nation relationship, but after failing to act for a full year, he made the same commitment to the National Chief of the AFN on January 11. EOS BOS Yet there was no mention of it in his speech to caucus yesterday. EOS BOS Many first nations, Inuit and Métis people are living in poverty in homes without electricity and they have no choice but to send their kids to schools that receive one-third less funding than other schools in Canada, while Conservative backbenchers and senator are hurling insults. EOS BOS Action is needed now. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister act to start addressing these serious problems? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I outlined yesterday, the government's priorities remain strengthening Canadian families, making sure that our streets and communities are safe, strengthening this country and its place in the world and, of course, on top of them all, making sure we have a strong economy where people of all ages will have opportunities not just now but for generations to come. EOS BOS These are the priorities we have for all Canadians. EOS BOS They are important to all Canadians whether they are anglophone, francophone, aboriginal or new Canadians and we will continue to pursue them in the best interests of all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today we are debating a motion calling on the government to make the improvement of economic outcomes of aboriginals a central focus in the next budget. EOS BOS The government should therefore conduct nation-to-nation consultations in keeping with treaties. EOS BOS However, in his speech to caucus, the Prime Minister did not make this issue a priority. EOS BOS What is worse, the Conservative members and senators hurled insults. EOS BOS How will aboriginals fit into the next budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, like the 2012 plan, our government's economic action plan 2013 will focus on the economy, economic growth, job creation and long-term prosperity. EOS BOS Those are our priorities, not just for aboriginals, but for all Canadians. EOS BOS I would like to point out that Canada continues to outperform other countries, thanks to the steps we have taken. EOS BOS Of course, there are challenges that lie ahead for certain communities, particularly aboriginal communities. EOS BOS We will continue to pursue these objectives. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, in the Sudbury riding, we are proud of our cultural and artistic sector, which is a major contributor to the prosperity and economic diversity of our region EOS BOS .
              I was fortunate to take part in an announcement recently with the Minister of Canadian Heritage regarding an investment that will greatly benefit our region's creative economy. EOS BOS Can the minister tell us how the government is promoting collaboration among artists and creative industries, while contributing to the vitality of francophone minorities in northern Ontario? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Sudbury for his question and for his dedication to the Franco-Ontarian community in northern Ontario. EOS BOS Two weeks ago, the Minister of Canadian Heritage was proud to announce an investment of $12.5 million from the Government of Canada towards the construction of Place des Arts du Grand Sudbury. EOS BOS Investments like this one contribute to our vision of a creative Canada, while also creating good jobs for the middle class and new opportunities for artists, creators, and the entire community. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Great Britain recently announced that it will not make a decision about the F-35s before 2015. EOS BOS The United States confirmed that it will invest $2.8 billion to upgrade its aging F-16s while it waits for the F-35s. EOS BOS Australia will not commit to replacing its fighter jets until it knows when the F-35s will be delivered. EOS BOS The program is on increasingly shaky ground, and all of these countries have a plan B.What is this government's plan B? EOS BOS Canadians want to know. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Royal Canadian Air Force has flown CF-18s for 30 years and we are now working with our allies, involving Britain, to develop the aircraft that will replace them. EOS BOS Britain faces some unique challenges that all of us can well sympathize with. EOS BOS However, decisions are made based on the best possible information ongoing and we are monitoring the program. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is the only one that does not see all of the red flags: rising costs, safety issues, the list goes on and on. EOS BOS A Rideau Institute report released yesterday lays out the flaws. EOS BOS The report quotes the Pentagon's procurement chief, who said that things are messed up. EOS BOS The report also states that, given all of the delays, the F-35 could be obsolete by the time it is operational, if that ever happens. EOS BOS Why not unveil the plan B the government was bragging about not long ago? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the report to which the member opposite is referring was authored by a failed NDP candidate and the Rideau Institute whose bias is well-known. EOS BOS Canada's participation in the joint strike fighter program has already resulted in millions of dollars of profit to Canadian corporations and an industry that employs some 80,000 Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the report to which my colleague is referring appeared recently as a peer-reviewed study in the Canadian Foreign Policy Journal. EOS BOS It highlights yet again the many technical shortcomings and enormous cost risks of the F-35. EOS BOS The report makes clear that the F-35 is best described as an enormously expensive and troubled experiment. EOS BOS After all, it was just last month that we found out that the F-35 can even fly at night. EOS BOS Why is the minister exposing Canadians to such enormous financial risks? EOS BOS When will he do the responsible thing and put this out to tender? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that premise is absolutely false. EOS BOS The member opposite is referring to a failed NDP candidate who wrote this report, critical of everything that is holy and decent about this government's efforts to provide our military men and women with the resources that— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I see the hon. EOS BOS associate minister has more to say. EOS BOS The House should turn its attention to the minister so he can finish his response. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that report is absolutely biased. EOS BOS It has no objectivity whatsoever. EOS BOS It denigrates everything we do in order to help our military men and women do their job, look after jobs for Canadians and do the absolute right thing for the men and women doing these missions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, every day the Minister of National Defence demonstrates what a challenge it is for him to understand fairly basic concepts. EOS BOS First, he made up a capability gap whose very existence the Royal Canadian Air Force denies. EOS BOS Second, contrary to a document he himself signed, he made a false claim about the Conservative government deploying our troops on Operation Impact without danger pay. EOS BOS Yesterday, he said that cadets do not use weapons, but the cadets website promotes marksmanship competitions. EOS BOS Is the minister giving us facts or alternative facts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to supporting our men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS BOS We do not send our troops into places like Kuwait without presenting the tax-free exemption. EOS BOS Our government actually got the tax-free exemption. EOS BOS That was done in February 2016, which was signed off by the finance minister. EOS BOS We are conducting a defence policy review and making sure that we are going to be looking after our troops and not just making hollow promises, as the previous government had done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian veterans are Canadian heroes, and they and their families take great interest in changes to legislation that provide them with the benefits they deserve. EOS BOS On the Veterans Affairs departmental website, the background information on the budget changes for veterans is left blank. EOS BOS Why is the minister hiding information from Canadian veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member cares about veterans, and I know that she wants to make it better for all veterans. EOS BOS This should be a non-partisan issue that we can all work on together to make things better for our veterans. EOS BOS I did not know there was something missing from the website, but we will take that under advisement. EOS BOS If there is something missing, we will fix it and make it right. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that very much, and I do enjoy working with the member. EOS BOS There is an expectation by Canadians that changes to legislation are explained and available online through the Parliament of Canada website. EOS BOS However, on the legislation to implement the budget changes for veterans, no background information is available. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Veterans Affairs explain why this key information is being kept from Parliament and not disclosed to the veterans it affects? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I already indicated, I do not know about that particular issue. EOS BOS I do not have an answer for the hon. EOS BOS member right now, but I believe that kind of information is needed EOS BOS . We do need to share it. EOS BOS I will look into it and bring an answer back to this House. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the government is not there for Quebec. EOS BOS There is no softwood lumber agreement and no plan B. Our workers are going to pay the price as plants close, jobs are lost, and the regional economy weakens. EOS BOS The Government of Quebec is grabbing the bull by the horns and announcing loan guarantees. EOS BOS The federal government should take its responsibilities seriously once and for all. EOS BOS Quebec already has a plan B. Is the minister waiting for hell to freeze over? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are prepared for any eventuality and we will continue to work with the Canadian forestry industry. EOS BOS The Minister of International Trade and I had a very productive meeting with our Quebec counterparts last week, and we will to continue to work with them and our provincial and territorial colleagues. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the government's response to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs' 15th report, the Minister of State for Democratic Reform wrote:An essential part of a well-functioning democracy is the willingness to make reforms to the administration of elections when needed.... EOS BOS The Government will also review further recommendations of the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada that may be forthcoming. EOS BOS Can the Minister of State for Democratic Reform please update the House on his plans to introduce a comprehensive election reform proposal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is pleased to announce that it will introduce comprehensive legislation on Thursday to improve the integrity, accountability, and administration of Canada's election laws. EOS BOS The new legislation will respond to the motion passed by the House of Commons last year and a recommendation made by the Chief Electoral Officer, the procedure and House affairs committee, and others. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying on behalf of all of us in the House that we wish the Minister of Finance well and a speedy recovery. EOS BOS [Translation]Today, there 300,000 more unemployed people than there were before the recession. EOS BOS In 2008, the unemployment rate was 11% and now it is 15%. EOS BOS The youth unemployment rate is double the national average. EOS BOS What is the government waiting for? EOS BOS When will it offer up practical measures for reducing the unemployment that is hurting our economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has taken action to make sure that youth have opportunities across the entire country. EOS BOS With the youth employment strategy we have created over 50,000 new jobs for young Canadians. EOS BOS In budget 2012, huge investments were made to make sure that young Canadians have opportunities to develop skills and contribute to the economy. EOS BOS Unlike the NDP, we are taking action to make sure that young Canadians have opportunities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact is that during the recession, 280,000 young Canadians lost their jobs and to this day only about 10% of those jobs have been recovered. EOS BOS Youth unemployment is double the national average. EOS BOS We are talking about one million young Canadians who are out of work. EOS BOS That is no way to build a future economy in this country. EOS BOS Let me try again: what is the government waiting for to take real steps to help the unemployed get back to work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the NDP the government has taken action. EOS BOS The government is focused on making sure that young Canadians have opportunities, whether through the Canada student jobs program that created 36,000 new jobs for young Canadians or the 50,000 new permanent jobs for these young Canadians. EOS BOS We are taking action. EOS BOS We are focused. EOS BOS We ask the NDP to join us to make sure that those young Canadians have opportunities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, spring has arrived in Cape Breton and in many communities across Canada. EOS BOS This is when our construction season normally is getting into high gear, but the Conservative government stalled infrastructure spending last year and it looks like this year will be another repeat. EOS BOS This past weekend I was speaking with many councillors in my riding and they are concerned that there is going to be another year lost. EOS BOS Is the Conservative government willing to commit to the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and other municipalities to get the job done and get our people back to work? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have delivered the most important plan in Canadian history for infrastructure. EOS BOS We transferred last year, in July and November, two tranches of the gas tax fund to all provinces in Canada. EOS BOS Projects are ready to be announced. EOS BOS Some have been announced in Nova Scotia and other parts of the country, and we will continue to work very hard with municipalities and provinces in respect of jurisdictions and what they did not have in the past. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to end the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are going to do. EOS BOS However, today the members from Western Arctic and Skeena—Bulkley Valley caved to pressure from their big city elite union bosses and showed up at the public safety committee to attempt to gut our legislation. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please comment on the action of these two members of Parliament? EOS </s> BOS I am afraid that question has nothing to do with the administration of government. EOS BOS We will go on to the hon. EOS BOS member for Vancouver Quadra. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, seasonal workers are on the verge of falling into the infamous black hole, a period of no employment insurance benefits. EOS BOS However, there is nothing for these workers in the budget. EOS BOS We have sick people waiting in hospital hallways and students going into debt to learn, but this budget abandons them as well, since it does not contain any transfer increases. EOS BOS The same goes for leading-edge businesses in Quebec: the budget offers nothing for them. EOS BOS In spite of all these omissions, the government is predicting a $29-billion deficit. EOS BOS Does the government realize that all Canadians, and especially those who need help, are paying for its lax attitude towards tax havens? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, budget 2016 was an historic budget. EOS BOS It helps people across this country. EOS BOS It certainly helps people in Quebec, like it helps people across this country, with changes in their taxes, with changes in the way we give the Canada child benefit. EOS BOS It will make a real difference for people in that province, as it will across the country, through investments in infrastructure and in the long-term growth of our economy. EOS BOS We are confident that people in Quebec and across the country will have a better future as a result of these investments. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Revenue just announced that 100 investigators would be hired to identify tax fraud. EOS BOS That is all well and good, but the problem is that it is essentially legal to use tax havens, since Liberal and Conservative governments drafted the tax rules specifically to allow profiteers to repatriate their profits without paying anything here. EOS BOS Instead of announcing symbolic measures, will this government commit to seriously crack down on tax havens by abolishing the regulatory framework that helps them, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today I made an unprecedented announcement about combatting tax evasion and international tax avoidance. EOS BOS The vast majority of middle-class Canadians pay their fair share of taxes, but some wealthy Canadians are hiding their money in foreign tax havens to avoid paying taxes. EOS BOS That is not fair and it must change. EOS BOS Thanks to our historic $444 million investment, wealthy Canadians will be required to pay their share of taxes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is so sad when someone starts to become more and more incompetent in a particular job. EOS BOS There is yet another failed Conservative program. EOS BOS The first nations market housing fund was created eight years ago but has produced less than 1% of the 25,000 homes it was supposed to produce by 2018.Is that the Conservatives' response to the housing crisis in aboriginal communities—an ineffective program that has done little more than finance one more bureaucracy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the purpose of that program is to increase private home ownership for first nations people on reserve. EOS BOS We want to see first nations individuals being able to have the pride, the security, and the financial stability that come with owning their own home. EOS BOS We always review programs to ensure that they meet the goals required, but we think it is important that first nations individuals can own their own home on reserve. EOS BOS That is why we created this fund. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister should know that the government cynically promised to build 25,000 homes in this $300 million market fund. EOS BOS Now, seven years later, they have built 99.The government's own estimates confirm a housing crisis on reserve, with severe shortages of 20,000 to 35,000 new units and 5,200 replacement units. EOS BOS Building sufficient and safe housing on reserve builds local economies and creates jobs. EOS BOS The government has failed miserably. EOS BOS Where are the 25,000 homes that the government promised? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member does not understand what the program is designed to do. EOS BOS It is to encourage and to enable individuals to choose to build their own home and own it on reserve. EOS BOS It is no surprise coming from the opposition, which voted against and does not believe that women should have their own property rights on reserve. EOS BOS It seems that it does not agree that aboriginal individuals should have their own homes on reserve. EOS BOS We believe that they should. EOS BOS That is why we created this program. EOS BOS We always review our programs to ensure that they are meeting the goals that we set out. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, during question period, I made reference to the “Labour Market Assessment, 2016” of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS It demonstrates that Canada lost 6,000 net full-time jobs in the last year; that Canada also lost 20,000 manufacturing jobs, despite a low dollar; and that contrary to the 200,000 additional jobs that were being added in the last five years of the previous government, job growth has now come to a grinding halt. EOS BOS I wonder if I could seek the unanimous consent of the House to table this important report by the parliamentary budget officer. EOS </s> BOS Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to table the document? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: No. EOS BOS The Assistant Deputy Speaker (Mrs. Carol Hughes): There is no unanimous consent. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government continues to shake the confidence of federal public servants. EOS BOS Threats of blind cuts are looming in the national capital region. EOS BOS Today we learn that the government has already increased the use of vulnerable temporary workers by 100%.Why does the Conservative government prefer using cheap labour over paying its public servants properly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member to this place and I also thank the electorate of Parry Sound— EOS BOS Muskoka for allowing me to be in this place. EOS BOS The issues that the hon. EOS BOS member refers to involve merely 1% of total payroll expenditures. EOS BOS Of course, we use temporary help when it is crucial to ensure the delivery of services to all Canadians that are needed to meet unexpected circumstances, fluctuations in workload and special expertise. EOS BOS Those are the things that help us deliver services to Canadians and that is why we are proud to do it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in an article published today in Le Droit, we also learn that temporary workers are paid half the value of the job. EOS BOS The Conservative government is increasingly ridding the public service of its best and brightest and undermining the economic driver of our region. EOS BOS Is that what this government envisions for the future of the national capital region: precarious work, privatization and cheap labour? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the main estimates and the budget outline the government's annual priorities with regard to budgetary planning and resource allocation for the fiscal year. EOS BOS The main estimates include details on planned budgetary expenditures of more than $2,000 billion for the fiscal year. EOS BOS (1455)[English]We are doing things in a prudent way and spending on things that Canadians care about. EOS BOS That was our mandate and we are going through with it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government said it did not order public servants to replace the term “Government of Canada” with the Prime Minister's own name. EOS BOS However, records show that is just not true. EOS BOS As one Industry Canada official noted in an email, he was forced to use the PM's name “as per our directive from PCO”. EOS BOS This Soviet-style politicization of Canada's bureaucracy is unethical, and it breaks the government's own rules. EOS BOS Why force neutral public servants to do the Prime Minister's partisan bidding? EOS BOS Why cover it up? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been called a lot of things, but never “Soviet-style”. EOS BOS This is a first for me. EOS BOS I want to assure the hon. EOS BOS member that in fact there is no need for a directive that she seems to believe in, because it has been a long-standing practice across various governments. EOS BOS In fact, when the Liberals were in government, they used the term “Chrétien government”, “Martin government” and similar variations in official government communications. EOS BOS The proof is in the pudding. EOS BOS This terminology is widely used by journalists and by the opposition parties. EOS BOS If the circumstances permit, those are the circumstances in which we would use that term. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the annual report of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, the department says that the target for graduation from high school is going to move over the next five years from 35% to 43%. EOS BOS That means it would take 25 years for first nation students to reach the same level of graduation as their neighbouring students in provinces across the country. EOS BOS I ask the Prime Minister, is he aiming high enough? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said, the government is acutely aware of challenges that remain in first nations education, notwithstanding the fact we have made unprecedented investments in building new schools and renovating existing schools. EOS BOS The government has undertaken a consultation with first nation communities across the country to improve aboriginal education and to make sure we get the results for the dollars we are spending, because there are tremendous opportunities for aboriginal people who have a solid education. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister told this House that Canada legally withdrew from the treaty to combat drought and desertification because it was “...not an effective way to [use] taxpayers' money”. EOS BOS The cost of the treaty, $300,000 a year, is roughly equivalent to half the cost of a G8 gazebo or 109 days of the care and feeding of a rented panda, less than 4% of the PMO office budget, a third the cost of shipping an armoured vehicle to India, or two days of government advertising to tell us how happy we should all be with the way the government is spending our money. EOS BOS By what criteria is that spending more effective than pulling our weight in the world to confront drought and expanding deserts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the criteria. EOS BOS That is making Canada's assistance more effective and efficient so we can dedicate those resources to the people most in need. EOS BOS We are supporting concrete measures to help developing countries deal with drought instead of paying for conferences, salaries, and bureaucrats. EOS BOS Our commitment is to help the poor in a tangible way. EOS BOS We are doing that. EOS BOS It is not about talk shops or travel. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government says it is still committed to improving the Canada pension plan and the Quebec pension plan because that is the favourite option of Canadians. EOS BOS Unlike the government's pooled pension scheme, the CPP and QPP are inflation-proof, provide a guaranteed defined benefit, and cost less. EOS BOS Canadians are not that concerned with voting records; what they want to know is whether the Minister of Finance will guarantee to the House that the CPP expansion is on the agenda for the upcoming December meeting of the federal, provincial and territorial finance ministers. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in talks on the Canada pension plan with our partners, the provinces, we continue to discuss any enhancements that may be appropriate at this time, but I would remind the hon. EOS BOS member that there was consensus, unanimous support, among the federal, provincial and territorial finance ministers to pursue the framework for a pooled registered pension plan. EOS BOS That is why we tabled it in this House. EOS BOS We continue discussions. EOS BOS We continue to develop the regulations around it to make an effective retirement plan for the 60% of Canadians in the workforce who do not have a pension plan right now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, northern reserves have experienced a huge epidemic of OxyContin addiction. EOS BOS Health professionals tell us that it is one of the most addictive substances ever created, but the Minister of Health has now approved the sale of a cheaper generic version of the drug. EOS BOS We do not need more OxyContin; we need Suboxone treatment programs instead. EOS BOS Will the minister pull OxyContin and generics off the market and protect northern communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the prescribing of drugs is a provincial jurisdiction, so provincial health ministers and doctors have a major role in limiting the abuse. EOS BOS The decisions on whether to approve a drug will be made by scientists based on their expert assessment of the science and safety. EOS BOS The opposition wants us to politically interfere in a scientific safety process. EOS BOS We will stand up for the patients. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has just won another environmental booby prize. EOS BOS Canada was the last country to report its greenhouse gas emissions data to the UN. EOS BOS Canada's delay in complying with its Kyoto protocol obligations is another Conservative failure in terms of the environment. EOS BOS Even Japan, despite the terrible tsunami, met the deadline. EOS BOS Why did the government not report its data on time? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me first congratulate my colleague on her appointment to the environment file. EOS BOS In rising for the first time in this House, I would like to thank the voters of Thornhill for returning me to this place. EOS BOS The Government of Canada has always fully and fastidiously complied with the reporting requirements of the Kyoto treaty. EOS BOS There was a 15-day grace period allowed at the end of the deadline, which occurred during the election, and we have filed those details. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it turns out that not only were we late reporting our data this year, but the government also decided to quietly remove data on tar sands emissions. EOS BOS It is no wonder, because the data showed a 20% increase in tar sands emissions in 2009 alone. EOS BOS That is more than every single car in Canada. EOS BOS Will the minister tell us who made the decision to try and hide this information on oil sands production? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would first offer a correction to my hon. colleague. EOS BOS We refer to the wealth of abundance in northern Alberta as “oil sands”.With regard to the question, in our reporting of the 2008 emissions the department attempted to offer sectoral numbers. EOS BOS It did not work and they were not included. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, climate change was not mentioned even once in the throne speech. EOS BOS Now the Conference Board gives Canada a failing grade for climate policies. EOS BOS These plans are so disorganized and inefficient that Canada will not meet its 2020 target. EOS BOS After five years of ignoring climate change, will the Conservatives commit to a national plan that addresses the very real challenges? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I again congratulate my hon. colleague on her appointment to the environment file. EOS BOS We do have a plan and that plan is working. EOS BOS We have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sector by sector and that plan is working. EOS BOS With regard to the Speech from the Throne, I think my colleague was somewhat literal in her expectations. EOS BOS We reiterated our commitment to reduce climate change emissions across the board. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada released its 2011 climate change plan to the United Nations. EOS BOS The plan shows that actions taken by the Conservative government are projected to reduce emissions by only one-quarter of what is needed to meet the 2020 target. EOS BOS Does the government have a plan to address the other three-quarters beyond deliberately fudging a progress report to the UN? EOS </s> BOS The short answer to that question, Mr. Speaker, is yes. EOS BOS We have a plan and I would advise my colleague to familiarize herself with it. EOS BOS She and all Canadians can visit the Environment Canada website to see how we began last year with the major emitting sector, transportation. EOS BOS We are about to address new regulations for coal-fired electricity generation. EOS BOS We will continue to work our way around the emitting sectors to meet our 2020 target. EOS
BOS Madam Speaker, the Public Appointments Commission was supposed to be part of the Federal Accountability Act. EOS BOS The secretariat was created 2,114 days ago, and since then millions has been spent, but the commission never materialized. EOS BOS Under the Conservatives, patronage has gone from bad to worse. EOS BOS Candidates with Conservative connections land plum federal appointments. EOS BOS Just when integrity is needed, Conservatives choose more patronage and waste millions on phantom commissions. EOS BOS When will the Conservative hypocrisy stop? EOS </s> BOS Madam Speaker, the member opposite should know that we tried to appoint an appointments commissioner, and it was that party in the opposition that shot it down. EOS BOS All appointments are done based on merit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, recently first nations in Ontario learned that the national child benefit reinvestment program has been slashed by 50%. EOS BOS Yes, that is 50%. EOS BOS This benefit helps support child care initiatives and food banks and was used to combat poverty. EOS BOS Now communities are scrambling to make up the shortfall, programs are at risk, and the job prospects of first nations parents across Ontario are looking worse. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives cutting this crucial funding, and what is their plan to help first nations communities with the shortfall? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will take a look at the file and get back to the member. EOS BOS I am unaware of those details at this time, but I will get back to her as soon as possible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the “guise” or “stupidity of the day” category, Service Canada decided that in Quebec, to avoid any criticism, it would remove all Christmas decorations. EOS BOS Imagine the Guy-Favreau Complex without Christmas decorations. EOS BOS It is time to turn the judgment switch back on. EOS BOS Since the Prime Minister  likes to lay wreaths everywhere, will he agree to put up some Christmas wreaths as well? EOS BOS What is he going to do about this decision? EOS BOS It is shameful! EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that there is no national directive on Christmas decorations. EOS BOS [English]In fact, what we do have at the HRSD head office is massive trees and well decorated wreaths. EOS BOS They brighten up the place and brighten up our spirits. EOS BOS As far as the Prime Minister, perhaps the hon. EOS BOS member missed it last night, but he wished everyone a Merry Christmas. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the Information Commissioner is scrounging around for money to balance her books, the Conservatives are throwing the door wide open to raising fees. EOS BOS Some are even talking about $200 per media request. EOS BOS That will do nothing to increase access to information. EOS BOS This government has the audacity to brag about its open data policy. EOS BOS Instead of fleecing the public even more, why do the Conservatives not meet deadlines and give the Information Commissioner the resources she needs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, every agent of Parliament is responsible for managing the funds that are allocated to them by Parliament. EOS BOS That is part of their role and responsibility. EOS BOS If any particular agent of Parliament has a problem with that, he or she can make a submission to the Treasury Board, and we would be happy to consider it. EOS BOS If the hon. member wants to litigate this publicly, that is fine, but there is a process by which these budgets are considered and ultimately passed or not passed by Parliament. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative MPs on the House access to information committee think that the best solution to fix our ever-shrinking right to know in Canada would be to charge journalists and other Canadians hundreds of dollars just to file a request for information that should be public. EOS BOS That is on the record. EOS BOS Why should Canadians be stuck with giant fees to ask for information that by law belongs to them? EOS BOS Does the President of the Treasury Board agree with his Conservative colleagues that jacking up fees is a good way to fix our broken access to information law? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member raised the more general issue. EOS BOS Let me cite some statistics. EOS BOS In fact, the responses to access to information requests have gone up by around 40%. EOS BOS There were six million pages released last year alone, which is an increase of two million pages. EOS BOS I would say to the hon. EOS BOS members that the access to information law is there for the public, for members, and for the media of course. EOS BOS If the agent of Parliament, the Information Commissioner, has a problem with her budget, she knows where to go. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, can the Prime Minister share with the Canadian public how much it will cost taxpayers to have three high-priced, Bay Street-linked law firms defending the PMO?Why does the Prime Minister need experts in courtroom litigation? EOS BOS Is that where the Prime Minister expects to find himself soon? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a clear answer is that the article the hon. EOS BOS member refers to is actually inaccurate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the week began with the PMO accusing itself of a cover-up and ended with Conservative senators blocking an investigation into whether Conservative senators tried to cover up an expense scandal involving yet other Conservative senators. EOS BOS No wonder the member has so much trouble explaining his government's actions. EOS BOS Yesterday, Deloitte claimed there was no interference with their audit, so how did a PMO staffer know on March 21 what the audit said about Mike Duffy weeks before it was released? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as Deloitte said yesterday, quite correctly, that the utmost in confidentiality was maintained as this audit was undertaken. EOS BOS I trust Deloitte. EOS BOS It has a fabulous reputation for the work it does, and as Deloitte said, full confidentiality was maintained at all times. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, PMO staffer Patrick Rogers sent an email on March 21 saying that the Deloitte audit will “...state that Duffy's lawyer did not provide information when requested. EOS BOS They were asked to complete the work by the end of March....”How can the Conservatives claim the PMO did not know anything when a staffer was emailing about the contents of the audit in March? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the audit was actually undertaken by Deloitte and not by the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS Deloitte has maintained that the audit was done with the utmost in confidentiality, and Deloitte supports that audit. EOS BOS Canadians can have full confidence that the work that was done with respect to the audit was done confidentially and is an appropriate report. EOS BOS Based on that, of course, that is why this government and the Conservative senators moved to have these three senators expelled from the Senate without pay. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, how much is the Prime Minister's Office planning to spend to hire three expensive law firms to defend itself in the Senate affair?Are the Conservatives hiring litigation experts with taxpayers' money because they expect they will soon have to defend themselves before the courts? EOS </s> BOS Again, Mr. Speaker, the headline is completely inaccurate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday Deloitte claimed that there was no interference or collusion in its audit of Mr. Duffy's expenses. EOS BOS If that is the case, why did one— EOS </s> BOS There is a translation problem. EOS BOS It has been fixed, it is working now. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Saint-Lambert has the floor. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday Deloitte claimed that there was no interference or collusion in its audit of Mr. Duffy's expenses. EOS BOS If this is the case, why did one of the staffers in the Prime Minister's Office know about the report's findings on March 21, several weeks before the report was released? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Deloitte was in front of the Senate committee just yesterday. EOS BOS From what I understand, the three auditors who undertook this audit on behalf of the Senate maintain that full confidentiality was maintained at all times and that Canadians could have, and should have, confidence in the work that they did. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the RCMP to investigate a serious infringement of the Parliament of Canada Act. EOS BOS The role played by Senator Gerstein and the Prime Minister's Office concerning the repayment of money to a senator contravenes this act. EOS BOS When, and not if, the RCMP begins its investigation, will the government finally stop protecting Senator Gerstein and remove him from his position as chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Senator Gerstein is not the subject of any investigation right now. EOS BOS The RCMP documents clearly outline that it is Nigel Wright and Senator Duffy who are being investigated by the RCMP for a number of infractions. EOS BOS As we have said constantly, we will continue to assist the RCMP as they move forward with this investigation. EOS BOS The Prime Minister, as I have said also on a number of occasions, went back to his office and to ensure that the Prime Minister's Office co-operates and assists with the RCMP in this investigation and will continue to do so. EOS BOS I think that is the standard that Canadians expect, and that is the standard that they will continue to see from our government. EOS BOS l EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary maintains that there are only two people under investigation, and he disputes how many law firms have been hired by the Conservatives to defend. EOS BOS My question for the Parliamentary Secretary is this: how many law firms have been hired, and which one is going to defend Senator Gerstein for his role in the cover-up in the PMO? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me just say this. EOS BOS On a daily basis, I am asked to get up in the House and I am asked a lot of questions. EOS BOS When I answer, on occasion the opposition gets all upset and some in the press get all upset with the way I answer questions. EOS BOS However, when there is a question like that, how can one answer a question like that, a question that is so completely disrespectful of this place? EOS BOS There are two options: I could answer it back just as disrespectfully, or I could do what I am about to do and ignore it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there we have a model of respect for the institution. EOS BOS Under section 16 of the Parliament of Canada Act, it is an offence to offer or promise compensation to a senator “for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence any member of either House”.In light of this, could the Attorney General explain why he has not asked the RCMP to investigate the actions of Senator Gerstein and certain former PMO staffers, as I have? EOS BOS Why do I have to do his job for him, and what are they hiding over there? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is an odd question. EOS BOS The RCMP have been investigating this for a number of months. EOS BOS The RCMP have put in a number of documents, which have been referred to by the opposition on a number of occasions. EOS BOS Those same documents show that the RCMP is investigating Nigel Wright and Senator Duffy, Nigel Wright for repaying expenses that Senator Duffy accepted but did not incur. EOS BOS Those are the people who are under investigation at this time. EOS BOS The documents quite clearly indicate that, and they also indicate the RCMP has been at this for a bit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday testimony at the Senate confirmed that Irving Gerstein contacted Michael Runia about changing the Duffy audit, and then, yes, Michael Runia contacted the auditors, asking them to alter it. EOS BOS That makes Michael Runia perhaps the most important witness to the allegations of interference with the Duffy audit. EOS BOS What possible justification could the Conservatives have for blocking the attempt to have Michael Runia testify under oath what he knows about blocking the Duffy audit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, of course, that is not what the senators heard yesterday in front of the committee. EOS BOS The senators heard from the three Deloitte auditors who confirmed that the audit was done with the utmost confidentiality, that no rules were broken, and that Canadians could have confidence in the work that they did. EOS BOS I can only assume that the Senate decided, after hearing that from the people who actually did the audit, that nothing further was required to confirm the veracity of what was done by Deloitte. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Michael Runia contacted the Deloitte auditors, presumably to strong-arm them on behalf of the PMO into changing the Duffy audit. EOS BOS How can they claim that because of the so-called Chinese wall that Deloitte held, there is no harm, no foul, in attempting to interfere with the investigation into wrongdoing, the improper expense claims, and then the audit into them? EOS BOS How low have their ethics sunk if they do not see what is fundamentally wrong with picking up the phone and trying to interfere with the work of an independent auditor into investigation of Senate claims? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, he is referring to the Senate committee yesterday. EOS BOS The Senate brought Deloitte in front of it to ensure that there was no interference, that the work that it did was kept in the utmost confidentiality, and that Canadians and the Senate in particular could also have trust in the work that Deloitte did. EOS BOS Those three auditors went before the Senate yesterday. EOS BOS My understanding is that they confirmed that no information was given to anybody, that the work they did was done in full confidentiality, and, again, that the Senate could have confidence in the work that they did. EOS BOS I suspect that is why they decided that no further action was taken. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, does the government believe that Senator Irving Gerstein was wrong to try and change the findings of the Deloitte report on Mike Duffy's illegal expense claims, with internal help from Michael Runia? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what is very important, first and foremost, is that the audit that was done was not compromised in any way. EOS BOS We heard yesterday from Deloitte that was in fact the case. EOS BOS On Senator Gerstein, I know Senator Gerstein, as a number of us do. I know him to be a very hard-working senator, someone who takes his job very seriously. EOS BOS I am very proud to serve in caucus with Senator Gerstein, and I hope I do so for many years to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, talk about inconsistentSenator Mike Duffy was thrown out of the Conservative caucus, yet there have been no consequences for his fellow senators who were complicit in this scheme to repay his illegal expense claims. EOS BOS Why have Senators Gerstein and Stewart Olsen still not been disciplined? EOS BOS Why have they not accepted any responsibility whatsoever for their involvement in this scandal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Senators Duffy, Wallin, and Brazeau were removed from the Senate or suspended from the Senate without pay because they accepted expenses that they did not incur. EOS BOS As the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions in this place, that is not a standard that we accept on this side of the House. EOS BOS That is why Senator Duffy was removed from the Conservative caucus and that is why the Senate then voted to have Senators Duffy, Wallin, and Brazeau suspended without pay from the Senate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Prime Minister said that he was informed on May 15 of the initial plan concerning the Conservative Party payment to Mike Duffy. EOS BOS Why did he not bother to tell the House before Mike Duffy spoke about it in the Senate five months later, on October 28? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, he is quite correct that the Prime Minister did say on May 15 that he found out about this. EOS BOS The RCMP documents confirm that the Prime Minister did not know about this. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions that had he known, he would have put a stop to it. EOS BOS Nigel Wright himself stated quite clearly the people he brought into his confidence with respect to the fact that he was repaying Senator Duffy's expenses. EOS BOS I think that is all very clear in the documents that were deposited by the RCMP with respect to affidavits filed by Nigel Wright and, of course, the documents recently filed by the RCMP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister was informed of the Conservative Party cheque to Mike Duffy on May 15.Despite all of the questions we asked him, the Prime Minister never bothered to tell the House. EOS BOS We want to give them another chance at being transparent. EOS BOS What other similar information that they may or may not have shared with the RCMP have the Conservatives decided to keep to themselves? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, allow me to correct the hon. member. EOS BOS The Conservative Party did not pay Mr. Duffy's expenses that he did not incur. EOS BOS As we know, it was Nigel Wright who repaid those expenses. I think that should have been clear by the number of questions that the opposition has asked on this. EOS BOS I just wanted to make sure that she was correct on that. EOS BOS Of course, the Prime Minister's Office will continue to assist the RCMP in this investigation going forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to the RCMP, there is an email that clearly shows that the Prime Minister's lawyer, Benjamin Perrin, was involved in the deal between Duffy and Wright, but that email was deleted along with hundreds of others. EOS BOS Who deleted those emails? EOS BOS Who gave the order to delete them? EOS BOS Does the RCMP have that information? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are Treasury Board guidelines that are in place which outline how emails are managed by employees when they leave offices. EOS BOS With respect to the amount of emails that were turned over, the RCMP, in its filing, quite clearly identified that thousands of emails were turned over. EOS BOS There were about 2,600 that were of interest to the RCMP and being reviewed as part of this investigation. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has said that he will continue to ensure that his office assists going forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians really need the truth about this issue. EOS BOS For weeks we have been getting farcical answers about lemonade stands and pizza delivery. EOS BOS I will ask a question and I hope I can get a straight answer. EOS BOS On Tuesday, the Prime Minister told the House that he first became aware of the Conservative Party's Mike Duffy payoff on May 15. EOS BOS Therefore, why did the Prime Minister not tell the House about the payoff until five months later when Mike Duffy brought it up in the Senate on October 28? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, the question defies some form of logic because what the member suggested was that the Conservative Party paid off Senator Duffy's expenses and, of course, we did not. EOS BOS I think it is quite clear that it was Nigel Wright who paid off the expenses of Senator Duffy. EOS BOS We know that was not right. EOS BOS That is why the Prime Minister, as soon as he found out, ordered his office to assist the RCMP. EOS BOS Let us be clear. EOS BOS It is Nigel Wright and Senator Duffy who are being investigated by the RCMP right now. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is word today that several members of the Conservative caucus will be bringing forward legislation to limit the power of the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS These MPs are joining others with growing concern about the conduct of the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS A recent access to information disclosure has even revealed that there may have been inappropriate political interference with RCMP operations during emergency response. EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister start addressing these concerns and rein in his office? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been great to have been missed by my friends across the floor, but I am not sure it will last more than 30 seconds. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is the most democratic in Canadian history. EOS BOS Let me state the facts. EOS BOS This is the first prime minister to reinstate the practice of a mandatory vote in Parliament before committing our troops into harm's way. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is the first ever to have created a parliamentary process so members of Parliament, including opposition, can vet Supreme Court appointments. EOS BOS We have had more private members' bills passed than any government in the last 40 years. EOS BOS The Globe and Mail did a study and found that of all the votes that happened on the floor of the House of Commons, Conservative members were far more likely to vote independently from their party. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in its cover-up scheme, the fraud squad in the PMO tried to corrupt a forensic audit that Deloitte was conducting on Mike Duffy: Wright instructed Rogers; Rogers enlisted Gerstein; Gerstein pressured Runia, the senior partner in a venerable firm. EOS BOS Runia should have told Gerstein to get stuffed, but instead he meddled with auditors actually doing the work and attempted to breach the ethical walls. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister want to know how this corruption came about on his watch? EOS BOS Why does he not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what Deloitte said yesterday in front of the Senate was that its audit was in no way compromised at all, that the utmost in confidentiality was maintained and that the Senate could have confidence in the work that Deloitte had done. EOS BOS That is actually what Deloitte said. EOS BOS Now, the hon. EOS BOS member can say whatever he wants and cast all kinds of aspersions on all kinds of people, but the facts are that Deloitte maintained confidentiality and the Canadian people and the Senate, more important, can also be confident in the work it did. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in an email on March 8, Patrick Rogers in the PMO wrote this about Senator Gerstein, “ EOS BOS The stage we're at now is waiting for the Senator's Contact”, that would be Mike Runia, “to get the actual Deloitte auditor on the file to agree. EOS BOS The Senator will call back once we have Deloitte locked in”. EOS BOS That is attempted tampering. EOS BOS Before Mr. Runia has to face the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario on a professional complaint, will the Prime Minister give him the chance to testify to this Parliament under oath? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not up to the Prime Minister to decide; it is up to committees to make that decision. EOS BOS I note that yesterday the Senate brought forward the three Deloitte auditors who participated in and undertook the audit. EOS BOS The auditors said that their work was done with the utmost and strictest confidentiality and that all the rules were followed. EOS BOS Upon hearing that, I suspect that is why the senators decided that no additional witnesses were required. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, corruption in the PMO is destroying a great many people. EOS BOS Former business leaders like Wright and Gerstein, lawyers like Perrin, Hamilton and others, now auditors like Runia, are all bending to the will of one man, the Prime Minister, who demands cult-like obedience. EOS BOS The fraud squad in the PMO drank the Kool-Aid, it broke every rule in the book and the police are closing in. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister show some respect for the office he holds and allow Runia and Gerstein to testify to this Parliament under oath? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there is another question from the opposition that brings the value of this Parliament down. EOS BOS I am sure the members opposite will complain about my answer. EOS BOS I know the good people in the press gallery will get all upset with me because I refuse to answer such a ridiculous question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier in question period, the Minister of Canadian Heritage confirmed that Ms. Meilleur met and spoke with Mr. Butts of the Prime Minister's Office. EOS BOS I would like to know why the minister is misleading the House. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleague of the importance of the process of appointing an official languages commissioner. EOS BOS Of course this was a merit-based, open, and transparent process. EOS BOS I have explained the process very clearly. EOS BOS In light of all these explanations, I hope my colleagues will respect it. EOS BOS The reality is that this is the first time a government is really explaining the process for appointing an officer of Parliament. EOS BOS Following this entirely credible and reasonable process that was done by the book, we were able to find the right candidate who has the skills required to fill the position. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we already know that this government is not even going to meet Stephen Harper's weak climate change targets. EOS BOS The Liberals promised the moon during the election campaign. EOS BOS However, the recent budget indicates that there will be nothing for electric cars and charging stations for at least another year despite the urgent need to address climate change. EOS BOS In the United States, Volkswagen was required to pay for a network of charging stations as penitence for its diesel scandal. EOS BOS Did the government at least consider that approach? EOS BOS Unlike charging stations, there is no shortage of Volkswagens on our roads. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, climate change is an incredibly important issue for Canada, and it is an incredibly important issue for the government. EOS BOS When we came to power, we launched development of a pan-Canadian framework with the provinces and territories that resulted in a historic agreement in December that focused on how we can have steps that will allow us to get to the greenhouse gas reduction targets while at the same time accelerating clean growth going forward. EOS BOS The budget followed on, providing funding for the pan-Canadian framework, providing $21.9 billion in green infrastructure funding and $2.2 billion for clean tech in Canada. EOS BOS We are on the right track, and we will meet our targets. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are making progress. EOS BOS They finally set a date to deliver the budget. EOS BOS Now all they have to do is find some real solutions to help Canadian families. EOS BOS The promise to enhance the universal child care benefit is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. EOS BOS According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, it is families with no child care expenses at all that will benefit the most. EOS BOS Why not invest that money in a child care program that would really help families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the insult to Canadian families just does not stop from that side of the House. EOS BOS To somehow suggest that families that are not using licensed daycare and paying a specific bill are not incurring costs to themselves, they are completely out of touch with Canadian families. EOS BOS We are going to increase it and expand it. EOS BOS We are listening to Canadian families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, talk about being out of touch. EOS BOS Canadian families know they will not be getting the help they desperately need from the Conservative budget. EOS BOS Instead of moving forward with the NDP's plan for affordable child care available to all families, the Conservatives are happy to push forward their income splitting scheme that will only see the wealthiest families in the country benefit. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives drop their regressive income splitting plan and put forward in their budget a solution that helps all Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the evidence shows that only about 10% of all Canadian families use licensed or regulated daycare spaces. EOS BOS Those are the only people their plan would help. EOS BOS Our plan helps every Canadian family, because Canadian families want to use a variety of options when it comes to caring for their children. EOS BOS They are all incurring costs. EOS BOS To suggest that Canadian families, when they decide one parent will stay at home or they will use another family member, are not incurring costs is absolutely absurd. EOS BOS It is wrong. EOS BOS Our plan helps every Canadian family with children. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Income Tax Act is based on self-assessment, but the act is getting more and more complex. EOS BOS The Conservatives are trying to use it to win votes. EOS BOS The agency acknowledges that 44% of the calls it receives go nowhere and that even when people manage to talk to someone, they have a one in four chance of being misled. EOS BOS Furthermore, the letters the agency sends are unreadable. EOS BOS For all of these reasons, I am concerned that seniors in particular will be at a disadvantage. EOS BOS What will the minister do to ensure that these people are treated fairly? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, to begin with, we encourage anyone who believes they have received incorrect information from CRA to make a formal complaint. EOS BOS We expect CRA to continuously improve the quality and accuracy of the telephone service it provides. EOS BOS We are implementing several measures to improve the quality of services offered by CRA. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the cuts do not end with protecting fresh water. EOS BOS There are major cuts to the Coast Guard too. EOS BOS The Kitsilano station in the heart of Vancouver is one of the busiest in Canada, but the government is planning to close it. EOS BOS This would double response times, putting lives at this international port at risk. EOS BOS Will the minister stop the dismantling of this station and reverse these reckless Conservative cuts? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I indicated earlier, levels of search and rescue service in Vancouver will remain the same. EOS BOS Search and rescue capability in the area was also improved through budget 2010, which provided funding for a new hovercraft available early next year, to replace the aging hovercraft at the Sea Island base. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last weekend 55 lives were saved because of the Kitsilano station alone. EOS BOS With growing traffic, the impacts could be severe, but the government did not consult anyone but DND. EOS BOS It did not consult the province; it did not consult the city; and it did not consult the community. EOS BOS It did not consult the facts. EOS BOS How can the minister close the station without talking to the very people whose lives he will put at risk? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very aware and we are convinced that search and rescue services in Vancouver will remain the same EOS BOS . We will strengthen our partnerships with other on-water search and rescue partners such as the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary. EOS BOS We think we have an opportunity to provide better service in this area. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of State for Democratic Reform  bizarrely claimed that giving the unelected and undemocratic Senate a veto over electronic voting was “...the best way to ensure the integrity of our electoral system.”Why does the minister think that the Senate, which was created before the invention of the telephone and is exempt from ever facing voters, should have a veto on electronic voting? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP was not even able to run an electronic voting system for a thousand delegates at its convention. EOS BOS It shut down the entire convention for three or four hours. EOS BOS If that were to happen in a national election, imagine what kind of national crisis we would have. EOS BOS The change in the fair elections act is to require that the CEO of Elections Canada at least secures the support of Parliament before he experiments with risky new methods of voting. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Senate does not even believe in having television in its own house. EOS BOS Instead of giving the democratically elected House of Commons the ability to decide if an e-voting pilot project is worthwhile, the Minister of State for Democratic Reform has handed a veto to the unelected, undemocratic Senate. EOS BOS It is not as if Elections Canada would be able to unilaterally change how voting works. EOS BOS That is a power the minister reserves for himself. EOS BOS Why is the minister hell bent on giving this veto power to the unelected, undemocratic Senate? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I commend the member to read the Canada Elections Act. EOS BOS In fact, the pilot project provision in the existing act allows the CEO to experiment with different methods of voting after consulting only the parliamentary committees responsible for that, which include, under the status quo, the Senate committee responsible for it. EOS BOS So there is already a Senate committee that oversees it. EOS BOS What I am proposing in the fair elections act is that before the CEO experiments with risky methods of voting, we at least allow parliamentarians to consider whether those methods are safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative majority in the unelected, unaccountable Senate has no legitimate role to play in deciding how MPs are elected. EOS BOS The Minister of State for Democratic Reform has made a number of bizarre claims in recent days, including implying that voter participation has declined because of efforts by Elections Canada to educate the public. EOS BOS Does the minister have any evidence to support this claim, or does he really not understand the difference between coincidence and causality? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am the only who has actually presented any data on the question at all. EOS BOS First of all, I presented the fact that since Elections Canada started its promotional campaigns, the voter turnout has plummeted by roughly 15 percentage points. EOS BOS Among youth, between 1984 and 2000 it dropped by 20 percentage points. EOS BOS When we look at Elections Canada's own data, the principle reasons why Canadians do not vote are practical ones. EOS BOS They either do not have time or they are out of town, and many of them do not know of the many different opportunities they have to cast a ballot before elections day. EOS BOS The fair elections act would require Elections Canada to give this basic information to voters so they have an opportunity to cast their ballots. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of State for Democratic Reform said that the decline in voter participation, which has fallen from 75% to 61% over the past few years, is due to Elections Canada advertising. EOS BOS That is the faulty logic he used to justify taking away Elections Canada's right to advertise. EOS BOS Can he prove that Elections Canada ads prevented people from going to the polls? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP has provided no evidence that Elections Canada ad campaigns work. EOS BOS Where is their data? EOS BOS They have not shown us anything to prove that. EOS BOS [English]I have demonstrated through the publicly available facts that not only are the publicity campaigns of Elections Canada failing, but also that one of the reasons why Canadians are not voting is that they do not have the basic information on how they can vote, for example, in advance ballots. EOS BOS We would require that Elections Canada focus its advertising on those important matters. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not think the minister understands the difference between correlation and causation, but that is not the only thing the minister is confused about. EOS BOS Under this bill, the Commissioner of Canada Elections will have to answer to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is appointed by none other than the Attorney General of Canada, who is a government minister. EOS BOS Why not set it up so that the investigative branch is accountable to the legislative branch, not the executive? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP obviously does not know how the Director of Public Prosecutions is named. EOS BOS First of all, there is a committee that has representation from every single recognized party in the House of Commons, including the NDP. EOS BOS Then there are two independent, non-partisan public servants from the public safety department and justice department. EOS BOS They all recommend names, which are ultimately approved by a committee of Parliament. EOS BOS Furthermore, the Director of Public Prosecutions can only be fired by a vote of Parliament, which, incidentally, is the same method that applies to all officers of Parliament. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite what the Minister of State for Democratic Reform would have us believe, the power to compel witnesses to appear does exist in our system. EOS BOS Parliamentary committees and even the Competition Bureau have this right. EOS BOS Why does the minister not think it is necessary to give the Commissioner of Canada Elections this power? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, even police officers investigating the most reprehensible crimes do not have the power the hon. EOS BOS member is referring to. EOS BOS Even for violent crimes, police officers do not have this power. EOS BOS The commissioner already has the same investigative powers as police officers and the RCMP, and we are giving the commissioner additional powers by prohibiting people from obstructing investigations and lying to investigators. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we already know that this bill will pave the way for the return of big money to our electoral system. EOS BOS One proposal that is a little strange would allow candidates to give more money to themselves, and that amount will be higher than what another Canadian can donate. EOS BOS How does the minister justify the clause that allows candidates to donate $5,000 to themselves, which is three times the maximum that other people can give? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when we introduced a bill prohibiting the use of other people's names to get around donation limits, the other parties said that this would prevent candidates from launching their own campaigns. EOS BOS We are therefore going to allow candidates to give themselves enough money to get their campaign off the ground. EOS BOS After that, all donations collected must be under the donation limit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in 2002, Conservatives supported the NDP's call to make financial documents from political parties available upon request. EOS BOS They even agreed to our motion to make this happen. EOS BOS Currently, while local candidates must make every last receipt and claim public, which is good, political parties only have to release summaries. EOS BOS Why do Conservatives not want Canadians to see spending details in their campaigns? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is quite the contrary. EOS BOS The fair elections act creates new provisions that would require political parties to be subjected to tougher external compliance audits before they can be reimbursed. EOS BOS Furthermore, the CEO has the power to ask parties to provide financial information, and he can also refuse to provide millions of dollars in campaign reimbursements to those same parties until they comply with his request. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when the Minister of State for Democratic Reform runs in the next election, he will have to register all of his expenses and remember to include all receipts. EOS BOS Why does he think this rule need not apply to the Conservative Party of Canada? EOS BOS What is he trying to hide and why does he want to protect his party? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, our bill requires that political parties be subject to independent audits to show that they have obeyed the rules and that every penny is counted. EOS BOS At the same time, the Chief Electoral Officer has the power to ask the parties for more details before they are reimbursed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the infrastructure privatization bank becomes a crown corporation, it will be able to steamroll over the provinces and cities and barge right in. EOS BOS It reminds me of Canada Post and its community mailboxes. EOS BOS Yesterday, the minister said that he consulted with the provinces. EOS BOS Oddly enough, today the National Assembly passed a unanimous motion calling on the future bank to respect Quebec’s laws. EOS BOS Some consultation, great job! EOS BOS The minister says just about anything. EOS BOS Instead of insulting the National Assembly, what will the 40 Liberals from Quebec do to defend Quebec’s laws? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the bank would be set up with the same legal structure as many other crown corporations. EOS BOS Any project that it would invest in would be required to follow all provincial, territorial, and municipal laws. EOS BOS We respect the jurisdiction of our provinces. EOS BOS We are investing a historic amount of money. EOS BOS We are tripling our investments to build the infrastructure that is required by our municipalities and that is required by our provinces. EOS BOS We do that in co-operation and collaboration with our provincial and territorial partners. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the members opposite continue to ignore the biggest electoral fraud in our history. EOS BOS Thousands of voters were cheated and their fundamental right was trampled. EOS BOS How does this government react? EOS BOS By throwing as much mud around as it can in order to create a diversion. EOS BOS “I do not know.” “ EOS BOS It was not me, it was him.” “ EOS BOS It was a kid from Guelph.” “ EOS BOS It is the Liberals' fault.” “ EOS BOS My dog ate it.”The Conservative strategy is simple and consists of saving their fraudster friends at any cost. EOS BOS Is there anyone, just one minister, who is going to do the right thing and call for a public inquiry? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Elections Canada is investigating the matter. EOS BOS We are going to co-operate with Elections Canada. EOS BOS However, I can assure the House that all the allegations made by the hon. EOS BOS member are false. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the Conservatives are being investigated. EOS BOS It was the Conservatives who pleaded guilty last year because they broke other election laws. EOS BOS As punishment, the Prime Minister appointed those Conservatives to the Senate. EOS BOS The fact is that it was Conservative campaign lists being used to send voters to the wrong polling stations. EOS BOS It is Conservative Party operatives who are under investigation by Elections Canada and the RCMP.Why is the government refusing to admit that this scandal is far-reaching? EOS BOS When will it commit to a public inquiry to restore faith in our democracy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the member opposite just said is categorically false. EOS BOS We are aware of a single investigation that is going on with respect to the riding of Guelph. EOS BOS Obviously our party is fully participating with that. EOS BOS The member opposite completely forgot to mention that, of course, the NDP was caught diverting money into the Broadbent Institute; that great unifying force in the NDP, Mr. Ed Broadbent. EOS BOS Yes, they were diverting money illegally via the NDP into the Broadbent Institute. EOS BOS Shame on them. EOS BOS The member should apologize next time she rises. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of International Trade claims that her vanity trip to California was to promote Canadian business interests. EOS BOS However, emails released through access to information paint a very different picture. EOS BOS Her staff were scrambling to put a program together and were begging LA Times journalists for an interview. EOS BOS Senior foreign policy and diplomacy officer Dan Pasquini stated in an email, “this visit has only just fallen in our laps”.Why does the minister continue to claim the trip was about Canadian business interests when it was actually all about her? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the Conservatives are trying to create a story where there is none. EOS BOS It is my job to promote Canada in the United States. EOS BOS In fact, just yesterday, I was pleased to be in Washington for a trilateral trade meeting with my American and Mexican counterparts. EOS BOS It was my sixth visit to the United States in six months. EOS BOS What I am hearing in the U.S. is that after a lost decade, Canada is finally back at the table. EOS BOS I am going to keep going back and doing what the Conservatives failed to do: support trade, jobs, and our middle class. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in a one-on-one sit down interview with the LA Times, the minister's California dream trip was characterized as a “brief stopover”. EOS BOS LA Consul General Villeneuve noted there “seems to be a bit of confusion”.The Global Affairs director general of communications was also confused, saying in emails, “ EOS BOS What is she doing in LA? EOS BOS Besides the Bill Maher show?”Clearly, this was a personal trip built around her TV appearance. EOS BOS We know the Liberals are entitled to their entitlements, but are taxpayers not entitled to an honest answer about the real purpose for her going to LA? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives continue to try to create a story where there is none. EOS BOS The media appearances were part of the official visit, along with six business round tables. EOS BOS It is my job to promote Canada to the world. EOS BOS However, since the members opposite are so interested in this topic, let me remind them that their own leader, the former prime minister, spent $50,000 of taxpayer money to get himself U.S. media appearances EOS BOS . We do not need to do that; we get invited. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the story is that the Minister of International Trade needs to be honest with Canadians. EOS BOS She declares proudly that she was in California to promote Canadian business, but her own officials did not even know about the trip until two days before. EOS BOS The minister indicates that she met with the lieutenant governor of California and a U.S. senator, but does not mention that it was on the late show with Bill Maher. EOS BOS When will the minister just be honest and tell Canadians she went to Hollywood on a personal vanity trip, using taxpayer money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the Conservatives, we know it is our government's job to promote Canada to the world. EOS BOS When I travel to promote Canada, I am proud to speak to the international media. EOS BOS Just yesterday, I gave an interview to POLITICO in Washington. EOS BOS As minister, I would like to list some of the other international interviews I have done. I have done an interview with MSNBC, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the LA Times, and the Financial Times. EOS BOS I have done three BBC interviews. EOS BOS I have spoken to EU Trade Insights. EOS BOS I spoke to La Libre; Deutsche Welle, the German TV; Bloomberg Television; Handelsblatt— EOS
BOS The member for Elgin—Middlesex—London. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the minister's staff had to scramble at the last minute to find things to do in California to justify doing a late night show on HBO.When the minister's own staff is informed that she will be in LA just two days prior to her arrival, how are Canadians to believe it was on government business? EOS BOS The Minister of International Trade used taxpayer money to further her personal interests, not the interests of Canadian business. EOS BOS When will the minister pay back the money for this vanity trip? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives continue to try to create a story where there is not one. EOS BOS I would now like to share with the House some details of the business meetings I had when I was in California. EOS BOS Here are some of the people I met with: James Haney, senior VP and general manager of City National Bank, recently acquired by RBC; Greg Foster, CEO of IMAX; Creative BC, and Trade and Invest BC, were there; John Chiang, the treasurer of the state of California; and Jeff Gorell, deputy mayor. EOS BOS Other meetings I had there included a reception with the Friends of BC, a meeting with Los Angeles economic leaders— EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Vancouver Kingsway. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the federal government's gradual withdrawal from social housing and the fight against homelessness is at risk of causing a dramatic increase in rental costs for hundreds of thousands of low-income renters. EOS BOS Many others will be left out on the streets. EOS BOS Stakeholders at all levels are demanding that the federal government also do its part, be it through the homelessness partnering strategy or HPS or other housing programs. EOS BOS Will the government remedy this situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the new member and wish her luck. EOS BOS [English]I also take this opportunity to thank the good folks of Haldimand— EOS BOS Norfolk for once again placing their trust in me. EOS BOS I pledge to honour that trust to the best of my ability. EOS BOS During our economic action plan, we made tremendous investments in social and affordable housing. EOS BOS Some 26,000 projects are under way right across the country. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the hon. member's party did not support those initiatives that are helping so many people who are vulnerable EOS BOS . EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, they are fine words, but they are just not good enough. EOS BOS Instead of working to fix the problem, Conservatives actually cut housing programs. EOS BOS Last year, thousands of Ontario families could not afford decent roofs over their heads, and almost 70,000 of those families live in Toronto. EOS BOS Make no mistake that this is a national crisis and seniors bear the biggest burden. EOS BOS When will the government open its eyes and address this issue? EOS BOS We need a national housing strategy. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we believe that having roofs over their heads is one of the hallmarks to help people get out of poverty, get into the workforce and lead self-sustaining lives. EOS BOS It is good for them and it is good for the country. EOS BOS That is why we have invested record amounts of money in affordable and social housing. EOS BOS Through our economic action plan, we supported the renovation and construction of some 26,000 units right across the country. EOS BOS Had it been up to the NDP, 26,000 families would not have received our help this way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier in question period, the Prime Minister said that his government is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy. EOS BOS Those are his words. EOS BOS This is a good opportunity to prove it. EOS BOS On December 7, the Minister of Finance introduced a tax policy that had a direct impact on the stock market and resulted in a 5% drop in the share price of his own company, Morneau Shepell. EOS BOS However, 680,000 shares had been sold a few days earlier on November 30, saving someone half a million dollars. EOS BOS To prove that he is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy, could the Prime Minister tell us if the person who sold those shares was the Minister of Finance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance  has always been transparent with the Ethics Commissioner, who is responsible for safeguarding the integrity of Parliament. EOS BOS He followed her recommendations, and he will continue to do so and to work with the Ethics Commissioner. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, all Canadians know that the minister sometimes forgets things. EOS BOS For two years, he forgot that he owned a villa in Provence. EOS BOS Now, he seems to have forgotten who sold 680,000 shares in his company, worth $10 million. EOS BOS Just now, referring to the Minister of Finance, the parliamentary secretary said, and I quote: “he sold all his shares”. EOS BOS Can the parliamentary secretary tell us when the Minister of Finance sold all his shares? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times in the House, all members and all ministers are expected to work with the Ethics Commissioner to ensure that the rules governing us are followed. EOS BOS That is exactly what the Minister of Finance did as soon as he arrived in Ottawa. EOS BOS He announced that he was putting all his assets in a blind trust and that he was divesting himself of his remaining shares in Morneau Shepell. EOS BOS He also announced that he was donating to charity any difference in the value of those shares since the election. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sure the finance minister has been pretty busy lately sorting out his ethical lapses, and raising taxes on Canadians while sheltering his own from taxes. EOS BOS His mind has been pretty preoccupied. EOS BOS Maybe that is why yesterday he could not quite remember what he did in November 2015. EOS BOS However, 24 hours have passed and I am hoping the Prime Minister may have spoken with his finance minister. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us if the finance minister sold 680,000 shares in Morneau Shepell in November 2015, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance, as I have already said, has been working with the Ethics Commissioner from the very beginning of his term. EOS BOS She is the one responsible, far from the partisanship that sometimes drives us in the House, to ensure that the rules and the highest standards of integrity are followed. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance has always worked with the Ethics Commissioner and will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in November 2015, someone sold a whole lot of Morneau Shepell shares and in the process saved a whole lot of money. EOS BOS Either the finance minister does not know who sold them, knows who sold them and it was not him, or knows who sold them and it was him. EOS BOS It is one of three answers. EOS BOS It is very simple. EOS BOS There should be no more threats from the Liberals. EOS BOS I do not think they are in any position to threaten us. EOS BOS They should just answer the question. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member already knows, the person responsible for enforcing the highest standards of integrity in the House is the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS It is with the Ethics Commissioner that the Minister of Finance has always been fully transparent by giving her his full co-operation to ensure that the rules are followed. EOS BOS That is what is expected of all members and all ministers, and that is what the Minister of Finance has always done. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, despite Conservative spin, the numbers do not lie. EOS BOS Canada just posted a $3 billion record trade deficit in March, and this followed a $2 billion deficit in February. EOS BOS Now we see the Conservatives starting to cave in at the TPP table. EOS BOS After being asked to affirm his support for Canada's supply manage sectors, the Prime Minister ducked, dodged and dissembled. EOS BOS Will the government stand in the House and clearly tell Canadian consumers, farmers and rural communities that it will completely defend Canada's dairy, poultry and egg industries in all trade talks? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times in the House, our government continues to promote Canadian interests across all sectors, in all regions of Canada at the TPP negotiating table. EOS BOS That has never prevented us from actually securing trade agreements that protect our farmers and promote the interests of our farmers. EOS BOS We make no apologies for ensuring that any deal reached must be in Canada's best interest. EOS BOS As always, we will only sign an agreement that is, indeed, in Canada's best interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously, we cannot trust this government to stand up for Canadians. EOS BOS Farmers are not the only ones who are worried about the future of supply management in Canada. EOS BOS The agriculture ministers for Quebec and Ontario are asking the Conservatives to commit to defending supply management in the discussions on the trans-Pacific partnership. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives do what Quebec and Ontario are asking and confirm their support for supply management today, in no uncertain terms? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unlike the New Democrats, who do nothing to promote trade, we have reached agreements with over 38 countries since we took office. EOS BOS We have always protected and promoted the supply management system. EOS BOS Poultry, egg and dairy producers are in good stead, and we are going to continue to defend all of Canada's industries. EOS
BOS In good stead, Mr. Speaker? The Conservatives are saying one thing, but doing another. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's recent statements on the future of supply management are worrisome to Ontario and Quebec. EOS BOS The Prime Minister said that Canada faces “ EOS BOS difficult choices” in the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations. EOS BOS He said that Canada cannot, alone, stop a deal from happening if we do not like it. EOS BOS I have a simple question for the Conservatives. EOS BOS Will they defend supply management, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the past is an indication of the future. EOS BOS In the past, we have signed free trade agreements with many countries, including the European Union and South Korea. EOS BOS We have always made sure to promote the interests of all industrial and agri-food sectors. EOS BOS I would invite the opposition members to support these free trade agreements because we know that freedom brings prosperity to Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives like to brag about the number of trade deals they have done, but in March they presided over the largest trade deficit of $3 billion in Canada's history. EOS BOS That makes, for the first quarter, a trade deficit of $7 billion. EOS BOS This weakness is especially worrying, given Statistic Canada's recent report that businesses intend to cut R and D spending by 2.6% this year, a worrying indicator for the future. EOS BOS The numbers do not lie. EOS BOS When will the government stop hiding behind absolutely ludicrous talking points on the TFSA and admit that its economic policies are failing Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will put up our record on trade against the Liberal record any day. EOS BOS The last time the Liberals spoke seriously about trade was in 1993 when they were threatening to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement. EOS BOS Today their idea of trade is to legalize the illegal trade of marijuana. EOS BOS On this side of the House, we are standing up for law-abiding citizens. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under Conservative rule, ministers who break ethics and conflict of interest rules get off scot-free. EOS BOS No slap on the wrist, no explanation to the House, no consequences, nothing. EOS BOS The Ethics Commissioner noticed this, and that is why she is now asking for the power to impose fines. EOS BOS Greater powers for the commissioner may act as a deterrent for repeat offenders like the Minister of Industry, who is the subject of not one, not two, but three investigations. EOS BOS My question is very simple: will the Conservatives agree to the Ethics Commissioner's request and give her the power she needs to put an end to this impunity? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government created the Conflict of Interest Act following 13 years of Liberal scandals and mismanagement. EOS BOS I can tell the House that we plan to review the Ethics Commissioner's recommendations once she has completed her study. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty dubious commitment. EOS BOS Still on the subject of impunity, I would like to know what is going on with the southern Ontario fund for investment in innovation. EOS BOS The Conservatives have created a secret $20 million fund that they are using to make $500,000 loans left and right, but nobody knows who is getting that money. EOS BOS This is a new low in Conservative secrecy: lending federal funds and telling taxpayers that they do not need to know how the money is being spent or who it is going to. EOS BOS Can they tell us who the money from this secret fund is going to? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, these are local leaders of their communities who provide local economic opportunities for those communities. EOS BOS Prior to receiving project funds, each network has to demonstrate that it meets clear guidelines regarding governance, internal administrative structures, and comprehensive selection and outreach processes to ensure not only the project's success but, of course, respect for taxpayer dollars. EOS BOS These are arm's-length community futures development corporations that have been around for 25 years and have proven to be successful in creating jobs and economic growth. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us get this straight. EOS BOS The Conservatives have set up a $20 million slush fund so that unnamed businesses can get secret loans without any public accountability. EOS BOS The problem with these sweetheart deals is that we are talking about taxpayers' dollars. EOS BOS This is not some Conservative pork fund to give out from the back of the car. EOS BOS Have they not learned their lesson? EOS BOS This is how boondoggles are born. EOS BOS Where is the commitment to public transparency for taxpayers' money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have already implied, these community futures development corporations have to sign strict agreements on the use of these funds. EOS BOS This is an arm's-length corporation that deals with local level needs in the economic development and in some cases the diversification of very small communities. EOS BOS The member opposite is making a very obvious reputation denials of these community futures development corporations. EOS BOS He has no evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, why is he doing it in secret?No wonder the Ethics Commissioner is fed up with those guys over here. EOS BOS There is a minister who was found guilty of breaking section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act, but rather than coming clean, the Conservatives have been hiding behind loopholes. EOS BOS They have trolling the letters of opposition members to obscure the fact that he was found guilty. EOS BOS No wonder the Ethics Commissioner wants the power to fine cabinet ministers. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives support the Ethics Commissioner in her desire to strengthen the rules or will they try to gut the act to cover up for those insiders who continually break the law? EOS BOS It is a simple question. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the other day I read a letter from the hon. EOS BOS member for Timmins— EOS BOS James Bay supporting AVR radio. EOS BOS It might be interesting to note that the president and executive vice-president of AVR actually made donations to the NDP in 2011. EOS BOS His letter of May 18, 2012, went to the CRTC.He stands as the ethics czar for the NDP and his main argument is that the NDP should be held to a lower standard of ethics than the Conservative MPs. EOS BOS Perhaps that is what Mary Dawson is talking about. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, after slashing CIDA's budget last spring, the new minister spends $25,000 on a retreat with his staff. EOS BOS That might have undercut his message about “being accountable for every nickel”.He also wants employees to sign a note saying that they will never criticize CIDA or its representatives. EOS BOS Yet when one of his partisan letters is posted on his department website, he blames CIDA.Is the minister trying to silence whistleblowers in his own department? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. EOS BOS Indeed, we developed a code of ethics with the public service, with broad consultation, and the particular code of ethics is in line with the code of values and ethics of the public sector, which expects certain standards of ethical behaviour. EOS BOS On this side of the House, if there is a whistleblower who has found any wrongdoing, we would welcome and indeed expect that whistleblower to bring this to the attention of the public and of relevant authorities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in addition to setting up a $25,000 retreat, the Minister of International Cooperation forced departmental employees to take a restrictive and troubling oath of loyalty that prevents them from criticizing CIDA and its representatives. EOS BOS The government must not muzzle public servants. EOS BOS If the government wastes money or makes potentially disastrous decisions, someone has to speak up. EOS BOS Why did the minister force such a code on his employees? EOS BOS What exactly is he trying to hide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not doing that at all. EOS BOS In fact, as I just mentioned in this chamber, if there is wrongdoing, if a public servant comes across any form of wrongdoing, we not only expect that public servant to come to the public, we welcome that. EOS BOS We also have certain ethical standards, certain standards of behaviour that are part of the code of values and ethics of the public sector, which the public sector was consulted on, and we also expect public servants to uphold those high values and ethical standards on behalf of the Canadian public. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to protecting and strengthening the long-term financial security of hard-working Canadians. EOS BOS Free trade creates jobs and economic opportunities and that is why we have made it a priority to open new markets for Canadian businesses. EOS BOS Could the Minister of International Trade please tell us why we are pursuing these agreements? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on being re-elected for a third time by the good residents of Kelowna—Lake Country. EOS BOS He knows, as does our government, how important international trade is to growing our economy, creating jobs and ensuring our long-term prosperity. EOS BOS Closing the doors to the world is not an option for us. EOS BOS Canadians know this is a kitchen table issue and how important free trade is to our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence continues to make gaffe after gaffe. EOS BOS Yesterday he was even forced to admit that he had fabricated information to justify Canada's participation in the mission in Iraq and Syria, but for an issue as important as this one, Canadians expect a basic level of professionalism from the minister. EOS BOS The cost of the war will hit $528 million by the start of next year. EOS BOS Will the minister finally take his job seriously and at least check his information before making statements? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last week I disclosed the estimates of the cost of Operation Impact against the terrorist and genocidal Islamic State. EOS BOS We believe that the additional cost of about $400 million is completely justified to respond to the threat that the Islamic State poses to the safety of Canadians and to the world. EOS BOS We must obviously combat this threat, and that is what we are doing right now in Iraq with our air force. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence says he regrets the inaccurate information he put into the public domain regarding Syria. EOS BOS Well, he made no apology for his statements nor about his claim that Canada was asked to extend the mission to Syria because we were the only country with precision-guided munitions, even though there are actually a dozen. EOS BOS Who made this request to the minister? EOS BOS Did it even happen? EOS BOS Why did the Conservative government use false information to justify Canada's decision to expand bombing into Syria? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, I reported publicly the information that I received in briefings from the Canadian military. EOS BOS As the Chief of the Defence Staff has said, when new information came to light, he corrected the record. EOS BOS As minister, ultimately I am responsible for all information provided to the department, and I do regret that inaccurate information was provided. EOS BOS Having said that, the real reason, of course, that we are now preparing to strike ISIL targets in Syria is so that this genocidal terrorist organization does not have a safe haven in which to plan terrorist attacks against Iraq or other countries, including Canada. EOS BOS We are doing the right thing by taking on this genocidal terrorist organization. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of International Trade rose in this House, not to offer solutions or an update on the progress of a new softwood lumber agreement, but to pass the buck, point fingers, and try to assign blame away from the mismanagement of the Liberals on this file. EOS BOS When will the Liberals take responsibility for Canadian jobs and bring home a new softwood lumber agreement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are within the 100 days to find a framework with our American partners on softwood lumber. EOS BOS The issue remains a very important priority for this government. EOS BOS We are aware. EOS BOS We are consulting with industry members. EOS BOS We are consulting with our provincial counterparts. EOS BOS We are obviously working with the Americans. EOS BOS As the Minister of International Trade said yesterday in this House, it is not just about getting an agreement; it is about getting a good agreement for this country, and that is exactly what we will do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the clock continues to tick down and we are going into a U.S. election. EOS BOS That response is simply not good enough. EOS BOS Hundreds of thousands of forestry jobs are on the line, yet instead of working hard to resolve the softwood lumber dispute, the Liberals are waving the white flag. EOS BOS Canadian companies need this agreement to be signed immediately in order to create good-paying jobs from coast to coast. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals planning to fail by failing to plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the only flag we are waving is the Canadian flag, and we are waving it proudly. EOS BOS We have every intention of coming away with a good agreement with our American partners that serves our industry across this country, as well as the particular provincial industries. EOS BOS We are aware of the various aspects and elements of this file. EOS BOS It is a complex file, but we have been working hard at it since day one. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, before the summer of 2016, the Canada 150 fund supported activities that encouraged participants to give back to Canada through gifts of time and energy, in ways that leave a legacy for the future. EOS BOS It supported activities that provided Canadians with opportunities to actively participate and celebrate together, promoting and building a deeper understanding of Canada, its people, and what it means to be Canadian. EOS BOS It supported activities that recognized and promoted exceptional Canadian people, places, achievements, and events that continue to shape our country. EOS BOS Why did the Minister of Canadian Heritage reject all of the proposals with these noble objectives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his important question. EOS BOS We are very proud of the vision we have put in place for the Canada 150 celebrations and of the lasting legacy they will leave, based on four themes: youth, the environment, reconciliation with indigenous peoples, and diversity. EOS BOS I am confident that my colleagues recognize the importance of those four themes and that we can work together to build our future for the next 150 years. EOS BOS We are also proud that thousands of projects funded in co-operation with our partners across the country will be carried out all over Canada and showcasing the best of who we are. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us be honest. EOS BOS Written words remain. EOS BOS Question 50 in part G has magically been transformed to read, “ EOS BOS The Canada 150 Fund will support new activities specifically designed to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation. EOS BOS We encourage applicants to design and propose projects that promote active participation and bring Canadians together to mark and celebrate our diversity in inclusive ways and help shape our country for the future.” EOS BOS Can the minister be honest, show some integrity, admit that she created an unfair situation, and explain why she changed the program's objectives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleague that everything was done with complete honesty and integrity. EOS BOS Everyone who participated in the requests for proposals was contacted and invited to submit proposals. EOS BOS As a government, we want to ensure a strong vision for Canada 150 celebrations, a vision encompassing the four themes that matter to all Canadians: youth, the environment, reconciliation with indigenous peoples, and the importance of diversity and inclusivity. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the privilege raised prior to our break regarding Standing Order 31, known as members' statements. EOS BOS Other members have already addressed a number of important points, which I will not dwell on in detail in my comments, including: one, that without the right of all members to speak freely, this institution simply cannot function properly; two, that the period of statements was originally intended to give members equal opportunities to raise issues; three, that other opportunities for debate in the House, such as debate on a bill, reflect the principle that all members have the right to speak, even if their name does not appear on the list submitted by a party; four, that the decision by Speaker Sauvé to ask parties for guidance or lists of members to speak was done solely as a matter of efficiency for the Speaker and was never intended to give the various parties a veto over who could speak; five, that conventions are not the same as rules and can be revised when needed to reflect current realities; six, that S. O. 31s were not intended to be used a partisan tool; and seven, that even if we view our parties as akin to hockey teams, the Commons is more like a House league than the NHL, and you, as the convener, Mr. Speaker, need to step in when some players are not getting equal time on the ice. EOS BOS As I said, I will not examine these points in further detail, but instead I hope to add to your understanding of the issue, Mr. Speaker, by examining the history of Standing Order 31. EOS BOS It is perhaps not surprising to learn that members have used various conduits to make statements since at least the time of Confederation. EOS BOS According to the Annotated Standing Orders of the House of Commons, second edition, the rules which guide the period for statements by members place the antecedents back to at least 1867.For about 60 years following Confederation, a rule existed which permitted motions to be proposed without notice, provided unanimous consent had been granted by the House. EOS BOS In the early to mid-1920s, however, the use of such motions experienced a marked increase. EOS BOS In 1927, the House agreed to a recommendation that the Standing Orders be amended so that unanimous consent would only be sought in cases of “urgent and pressing necessity previously explained by the mover”. EOS BOS The rule, as amended, was thereafter infrequently employed for decades, until around 1968, when MPs increasingly began to rise daily, choosing to do so in the time before question period to move motions that often demonstrated no urgent or pressing necessity. EOS BOS In 1975, the House amended its Standing Orders to stipulate that such motions could only be moved by non-ministers during a restricted time period to be held before oral questions. EOS BOS It is noted by O'Brien and Bosc that the moving of these motions prior to oral questions became, throughout the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, a common, although misused and often time consuming feature of the proceedings of the House. EOS BOS In 1982, the House accepted the Special Committee on Standing Orders and Procedures recommendation that it abolish this rule, which was called Standing Order 43, and institute a new renumbered standing order, Standing Order 31, that would have as its purpose to allow MPs to make statements on current issues on a daily basis during the first 15 minutes of a sitting. EOS BOS I believe the key point that history teaches us is that members need to be assured reasonable opportunities to speak in the House, and should they be denied fair access, they may feel forced to use other opportunities the Standing Orders provide to ensure that their constituents concerns are represented. EOS BOS The House has wisely recognized this tendency and rather than allowing certain rules to be used in unintended ways, to better accommodate the needs of members, the House has instead set aside specific times for members to have their say. EOS BOS Thus we have Standing Order 31. EOS BOS However, S. O. 31s are not unique to our House of Commons. EOS BOS The Australian House of Representatives has a practice that is broadly similar to the period our Parliament has and it too set aside time for statements by members. EOS BOS During the time designated for non-government business, a 15-minute period is set aside prior to its question time for members' 90-second statements. EOS BOS During this time, any member, other than a minister or a parliamentary secretary, may be called by the Speaker of the House to make a statement on any topic. EOS BOS In calling which member is to speak, the Speaker alternates between government and non-government members, with those who have not spoken given preference over those who have spoken already. EOS BOS Independent members are also called upon with the frequency appropriate to their relative representation in the House. EOS BOS Likewise, the British House of Commons provides time for members' statements, as do the legislatures of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan. EOS BOS (1515)I will spare the House the details of each of these variations on the times allotted, the number of speakers each day and so on, but I will emphasize that there are two important points to be drawn generally from the various legislatures. EOS BOS The first is that such statement periods are reserved for legislators who are not members of the cabinet. EOS BOS As ministers, they generally have a separate set of speaking privileges and opportunities assigned to them in each legislature. EOS BOS Fundamentally, the widespread and codified existence of a period for statements in so many different legislative bodies recognizes the need of legislators everywhere to have an outlet to briefly express their various needs or concerns. EOS BOS A second lesson that we can draw from Westminster and the provinces is that in many instances, it is the codified practice that the Speaker alone decides on the rotation of the speakers and not the various parties. EOS BOS This is to say that the Speaker can be aided by a list, but is not bound by one. EOS BOS The Speaker is rightfully seen in these many legislatures as an impartial referee who will determine that the right to speak is apportioned equally to all members, regardless of party affiliation. EOS BOS I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to consider that if members in this place are to be accorded equal speaking rights under S. O. 31, then you and you alone can guarantee that these rights are respected. EOS BOS Indeed, our own House recognizes this very principle of equal time already when it comes to private members' business. EOS BOS Under private members' business, every member who is not a member of the cabinet has an equal opportunity to participate. EOS BOS The schedule of who gets to participate in introducing private legislation is arranged in a rotation, regardless of party affiliation, as we all know. EOS BOS The same principle should apply to S. O. 31s. EOS BOS A rotating schedule would allow every MP an equal opportunity to participate in this critically important speaking opportunity. EOS BOS I am aware of members who have suggested that if we want to speak freely in this place, we should become an independent. EOS BOS I know we all agree that free speech is fundamental to the proper working of this institution. EOS BOS The idea that someone should have to leave his or her party just to be able to make a one minute statement in the House is simply not justified or reasonable. EOS BOS Nor is there any precedent for this drastic step in other parliaments. EOS BOS Considering all the points that have been made, Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to consider this. EOS BOS There will always exist in our parliamentary system a tension between the demands of a party and the direction an individual member might want to take in representing his or her constituents. EOS BOS It is clear to me that under our system of government, sometimes the demands of the party will need to take to precedence if the government is to govern effectively, such as when it comes to support for a budget or other key government legislation. EOS BOS However, there are also times when the rights of a member to speak freely should be paramount. EOS BOS Standing Order 31 speaking slots are one of those times. EOS BOS After all, these statements are merely words, no matter how contentious some of the subjects raised might be. EOS BOS There is no vote or any other action that can be taken during a one minute statement that is going to topple a government or cause an election. EOS BOS There is nothing to fear on the part of any party from ensuring members' rights to speak freely in the House are guaranteed. EOS BOS In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you certify that the true spirit and intent of S. O. 31s are upheld by accepting the arguments in favour of the member for Langley's question of privilege and ensuring that members' statements be assigned equally on a rotating basis to all qualifying members of the House. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. member for his further points of this question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, through you to the Prime Minister, in response to the very important decision today of the official opposition to oppose Bill C-51, I see that the Conservatives' talking points are to accuse opponents of the bill of either not having read it or of being forever ideologically opposed to anything the Conservative Party does. EOS BOS I wonder if the Prime Minister would square that point with the fact that The Globe and Mail editorial board, which has consistently supported the Conservative Party, has read the bill and condemns it as a secret police act. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we reject the argument we hear every time we talk about security that our freedoms are threatened. EOS BOS Canadians understand that their freedom and security go hand in hand. EOS BOS Canadians expect us to protect both, and there are protections in this legislation to do that. EOS BOS I invite the member to take part in the debate and eventually support the bill. EOS BOS It is important for our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Premier of Manitoba announced that the province will provide funding for housing and resettlement services for hundreds of asylum seekers who have risked life and limb to come to Canada. EOS BOS The premier also called on the federal government to set up a nationally coordinated response. EOS BOS The continuation of the safe third country agreement will mean that even more refugees will come to Canada illegally. EOS BOS As provinces begin stepping up, why has the Liberal government taken no action and provided zero measures to address this situation? EOS BOS Why are they missing in action? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to maintaining a refugee system that maintains our tradition of providing compassion to those seeking safety and security in our country. EOS BOS We remain committed to working closely with CBSA, RCMP, and local communities. EOS BOS We thank communities for their generosity, and local officials for welcoming individuals who are coming over from the United States. EOS BOS As far as the safe third country agreement is concerned, the hon. EOS BOS member may know or should know that, as of this morning, the head of the UNHCR in Canada has said that the domestic asylum system in the United States is unchanged. EOS BOS Therefore, the parameters and conditions of the safe third country agreement continue to be met. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have just seen one of the horrors of Canada's so-called safe third country agreement with the U.S. A woman's body was found in a ditch near the Canada-U.S. border. EOS BOS The woman is believed to be an asylum seeker trying to enter Canada. EOS BOS Under the agreement, asylum seekers from the U.S. are turned away from legal ports of entry, forcing them to take great risks. EOS BOS After five months and nearly 3,000 asylum seekers crossing the border, what else is the government waiting for? EOS BOS How many more tragedies do we need to see before the government suspends the agreement? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are aware of this tragic incident and our condolences go out to the family and friends of the woman who lost her life. EOS BOS We understand deeply the extent to which people will go to seek protection for both themselves and their families, but we strongly discourage people from crossing our borders irregularly. EOS BOS Canada is committed to offering protection and having a robust refugee program for those seeking protection from war and persecution. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, omnibus Bill C-44, introduced by the Minister of Finance, contains a virus. EOS BOS That virus directly attacks the independence of the parliamentary budget officer, which defies reason. EOS BOS The parliamentary budget officer is independent and must stay that way. EOS BOS With this bill, the Speaker of the Senate, who is not elected but appointed by the Prime Minister, will have veto power over the work of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Finance, who is an honourable man, explain such an unacceptable situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, our government is determined to make the parliamentary budget officer more independent. EOS BOS We have also said quite clearly that we were open to amendments. EOS BOS We look forward to the bill being studied at length in committee and to discussing all the good ideas that we presented on the changes affecting the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS Let us make sure that this bill gets through second reading stage today so that we can start the important work of improving the bill in committee. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is truly a shame that a man as distinguished and honourable as the Minister of Finance should become the architect of the Liberal government's dirty work. EOS BOS The government house leader just said that the government remains open to good ideas. EOS BOS We happen to have one. EOS BOS Would the government kindly remove from the omnibus bill all clauses pertaining to the independence of the parliamentary budget officer? EOS BOS I imagine that several Liberal ministers know that attacking the independence of the parliamentary budget officer makes no sense. EOS BOS If they know that, then let them do something about it. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as has been said time and time again, our government is committed to an independent parliamentary budget officer who reports to Parliament. EOS BOS That was the intent behind the legislation that was recently introduced. EOS BOS We are encouraging all members to work together. EOS BOS Let us pass second reading of this legislation. EOS BOS Let us send it to committee so the study can take place so we can improve the legislation to ensure the intentions of the government, which is to have an independent parliamentary budget officer, are fulfilled. EOS BOS Let us work together to make that happen. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary budget officer's job is to blow the whistle when the government cooks the books and calculate what spending schemes will actually cost taxpayers, yet the budget bill will give the Prime Minister's hand-picked Senate Speaker a veto over the work of the budget watchdog. EOS BOS With billions in new spending schemes and three decades worth of promise-breaking deficits ahead, why is the government trying to lock up the budget watchdog? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we said during the campaign and as we continue to say, we would like to advance the independence of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS We actually thanked the parliamentary budget officer for his analysis of the provisions of Bill C-44. EOS BOS We look forward to working with him and others to improve the bill to ensure we accomplish the objective of an effective and independent parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS I have said to the member and to all members, let us pass this legislation at second reading. EOS BOS Let us send it to committee so we can advance the independence of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS We can do this together. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Syrian refugee plan was supposed to cost $250 million. EOS BOS Instead it cost $1 billion. EOS BOS The Liberals said their deficit would only be $10 billion. EOS BOS It is more than double that. EOS BOS They said the budget would be balanced by 2019. EOS BOS Now it is 2055. EOS BOS To a government that cannot count, there is nothing more terrifying than a man armed with a calculator. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals silencing the one person who can give them desperately needed help with remedial math? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is actually entirely the opposite. EOS BOS What our government is saying is that we support the independence of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS BOS Where the previous government had the parliamentary budget officer responding and reporting to the Library of Parliament, we are saying the parliamentary budget officer should respond to Parliament, to members of Parliament. EOS BOS That is why we are saying to let us work together to improve the legislation. EOS BOS Let us pass it at second reading. EOS BOS Let us send it to committee so the committee can do its important work. EOS BOS We are open to amendments EOS BOS . I will continue to repeat that until members provide some constructive feedback to improve the legislation for the independence of the parliamentary budget officer. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today I rise in this place with a question for the Minister of Veterans Affairs. EOS BOS At a time when some are trying to tear away at the honour we should be demonstrating to Canadian veterans, our government and the Minister of Veterans Affairs remain focused on remembering those who have given their lives in the service of our country. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Veterans Affairs please update this House on how he plans to remember Canadian veterans? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for far too long, the Korean War has been the forgotten war. EOS BOS Successive governments have brushed aside complaints by Korean War veterans that Canadians simply did not know their sacrifice or their remarkable accomplishments. EOS BOS Not this year. EOS BOS This can be said no longer. EOS BOS Our government has spent 2013 working with members of Parliament, members from the other place, veterans associations, and indeed, foreign governments to right this wrong. EOS BOS As Remembrance Day approaches, I call upon all parliamentarians and Canadians to learn about and to remember those who fought so bravely in the Korean War. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Governor General highlighted our government was here for all Canadians. EOS BOS My question is for the new Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. EOS BOS What steps does this government plan to take to reduce red tape so Canadian small business can focus their attention on growing their businesses and creating jobs. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, economic growth and jobs will remain priorities for this government because they are the priorities of Canadians. EOS BOS We have designated 2011 as the Year of the Entrepreneur in order to help Canadians understand the role of entrepreneurs, who create our country's wealth. EOS BOS We need to reduce the red tape imposed on them, and we need to do so as quickly as possible. EOS BOS And that is what we will be doing with the Red Tape Reduction Commission. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, new GDP numbers out from Statistics Canada today show that the Canadian economy is again losing ground. EOS BOS GDP has been flat for over the last three months, but now it is actually starting to fall. EOS BOS The Governor of the Bank of Canada is warning of “atrocious” GDP numbers when the full first-quarter results are released in a couple of months. EOS BOS Governor Poloz is calling for immediate action to boost the economy and create jobs. EOS BOS Where is the budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, just to look at all of the facts, the fact is, of course, that the Canadian economy has grown over the past year, and the Bank of Canada and all other experts predict it will grow in the year to come. EOS BOS Obviously, we are all aware that there are negative impacts on the Canadian economy in the short run due to the fall of global oil prices. EOS BOS That is why we think it is more important now more than ever to make sure we have more money in people's pockets. EOS BOS That is why we cut taxes and provided benefits to every single Canadian family, legislation that is before Parliament right now. EOS BOS I encourage all members to support it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is going to be the first time in a full generation that a sitting government enters a new fiscal year without a budget. EOS BOS There is no excuse. EOS BOS [Translation]In January, the Bank of Canada lowered interest rates to one of the lowest levels in history. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is still not doing anything. EOS BOS Canadian families are coping with major layoffs in the retail sector. EOS BOS Another 1,500 jobs were lost at Future Shop over the weekend. EOS BOS Still the Prime Minister has nothing to offer. EOS BOS The new fiscal year begins tomorrow. EOS BOS When will we get a budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the Canadian economy has grown over the past year. EOS BOS All of the experts are predicting that it will grow in the year to come. EOS BOS Naturally, the sudden drop in the price of oil has resulted in some short-term negative effects. EOS BOS That is why we introduced legislative measures in the House to put more money into the pockets of all Canadian families. EOS BOS I encourage all parliamentarians to support the government's economic policies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for over three years now, we have been warning the government not to put all of our eggs in one oil sands basket. EOS BOS It did not listen. EOS BOS The sinking price of oil was predictable: it is cyclical. EOS BOS The government did nothing. EOS BOS We lost 400,000 good manufacturing jobs while the government stood idly by. EOS BOS That is the problem. EOS BOS This time, the Conservatives cannot blame the American economy. EOS BOS It is their own fault. EOS BOS The provinces are doing their job: they are tabling their budgets. EOS BOS When will we see a federal budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is pursuing its economic action plan. EOS BOS I recently announced support to open new markets, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. EOS BOS Yesterday, I was in Ontario, where Honda announced plans to export Canadian-made vehicles to international markets— EOS BOS European markets—thanks to our free trade policies. EOS BOS The current difficulties due to lower oil sands revenues are no reason to raise taxes, which is what the NDP wants to do. EOS BOS Clearly, it is time to give more money to Canadian families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians were horrified to hear of this weekend's massacre in the Syrian town of Hula in which more than 100 people, including 34 children, were killed. EOS BOS Even with UN observers on the ground, the Assad regime continues to ignore its commitment to the Annan peace plan and flaunt its utter disregard for human life. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Foreign Affairs please update the House on Canada's reaction to this weekend's violence in Syria? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his interest in this humanitarian disaster. EOS BOS This weekend's shocking attack has yet again demonstrated the Assad regime's utter contempt for humanity and decency. EOS BOS We call upon the Security Council to take stronger action, including having United Nation's Security Council sanctions. EOS BOS Canada continues to view the Annan peace plan as the best option. EOS BOS However, the international community must redouble its efforts to get adherence or move on to explore other diplomatic solutions to the crisis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as people around the world watch the negotiations with Iran over the issue of nuclear proliferation, Canadians want to know if the government is willing to take international leadership on nuclear disarmament. EOS BOS A year and a half ago, the House unanimously endorsed a New Democrat motion to prevent nuclear proliferation and increase the rate of nuclear disarmament. EOS BOS When will the government implement the intent of that motion and take leadership on nuclear disarmament? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I share the concern of the member opposite about nuclear disarmament. I think the strongest measures we can take are on stopping nuclear proliferation. EOS BOS That is why what is going on in Iran causes us all such deep concern. EOS BOS Before the P5+1 talks in Baghdad this past weekend, I had a long chat with Catherine Ashton, the high-level representative from the European Union. EOS BOS I spoke with her for more than half an hour after these meetings and offered Canada's full support for these efforts. EOS BOS If Iran obtains nuclear weapons, not only will it be a disaster for the Middle East and a disaster for the world, it will see the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, something I do not think any of us in the House want to see. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the courts have struck down parts of budget 2012. EOS BOS The Conservatives' unilateral changes to social assistance in Mi'kmaq communities targeted Canada's poorest citizens, and the Conservatives could not even say who their changes would affect. EOS BOS Would the minister admit his mistake and abandon his plan to gut social assistance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, indeed, a court rendered its decision yesterday. EOS BOS We are in the process of reviewing the decision. EOS BOS Once it is reviewed, we shall take a position on it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have it in for some of the most vulnerable members of aboriginal communities, which are already struggling with an unacceptably high poverty rate. EOS BOS Rather than consulting with aboriginal communities or conducting impact studies, the minister waited until the Federal Court blocked the changes that he wanted to make to the welfare program. EOS BOS Does the minister now realize that he made a mistake, and will he respect the Federal Court's decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I just told the hon. member's colleague EOS BOS , the Federal Court rendered its decision yesterday. EOS BOS We are in the process of reviewing the decision, and once it is reviewed, we will take a position on it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, the Statistics Canada May jobs report highlighted that three times as many full-time jobs were added to the Canadian economy than was predicted. EOS BOS That is 77,000 new full-time jobs. EOS BOS That is over a quarter of a million full-time jobs added to Canada's economy in the past six months. EOS BOS This shows that our plan of investing in the middle class is working, a plan that the leader of the opposition opposes. EOS BOS Can the parliamentary secretary please tell the House how our plan to invest in Canadians is delivering results for the middle class and those working hard to join it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians elected this government to grow the economy and create good, solid, middle-class jobs. EOS BOS In the last six months, over a quarter of a million full-time jobs have been created. EOS BOS That is the best growth rate we have had in 15 years. EOS BOS We have been working with businesses and innovators, and we have been giving the skills to young Canadians to make sure they are ready for the jobs of today as well as the economy of tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today's Auditor General's report is another scathing indictment of Conservative mismanagement. EOS BOS Conservatives have actually lost track of, wait for it, $3.1 billion. EOS BOS The Treasury Board could not provide the Auditor General with even the most basic record to verify this spending. EOS BOS We all remember when the Liberals could not account for $1 billion in spending at HRSDC. EOS BOS Conservatives called it a $1 billion boondoggle. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister hold his Minister of Public Safety accountable for this $3 billion boondoggle? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the premise of that question is completely false. EOS BOS The Auditor General himself said today that this had nothing to do with improper use of government money. EOS BOS On the contrary, it has to do with the categorization and reporting of expenses between departments over the period 2001 to 2009. EOS BOS There is some lack of clarity. EOS BOS The Auditor General has made some suggestions on how we can be more clear in our tracking in the future. EOS BOS We will do that. EOS BOS However, unlike the NDP, we remain fully committed to the legislation and to expenditures to protect Canadians from terrorism. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since 2007, wait times for citizenship applicants have doubled from 15 to 31 months, and the department admits it is because of the government's own funding decisions. EOS BOS Now it is tripling the fee to apply to be a citizen. EOS BOS The government is simply punishing those who wish to become Canadians, for its own mistakes. EOS BOS How can the government justify these fee hikes while service standards have dropped so drastically? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are misleading Canadians again. EOS BOS The citizenship fee has not been updated in 20 years. EOS BOS Now citizenship application fees will be better aligned with the actual cost of processing, relieving the burden on Canadian taxpayers who currently subsidize 80% of the cost. EOS BOS With our government's changes in the strengthening Canadian citizenship act, citizenship processing times would drop to less than a year. EOS BOS The Liberals had 13 years to make these changes, and they did nothing about it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the upcoming budget must address the tragic shortfalls in funding for mental health services. EOS BOS The Sask Party wants to believe everything is fine, but people in my riding face great challenges when it comes to accessing the appropriate mental health services. EOS BOS The federal government cannot continue to ignore the shortfall in our northern communities. EOS BOS People in my riding cannot afford to wait. EOS BOS When will the Liberals commit to a comprehensive long-term strategy that provides adequate mental health care to northerners? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her continued advocacy on behalf of her constituents and, indeed, all people in her province as it relates to the very real needs for mental health. EOS BOS She knows that we have invested in the area of mental wellness for first nations and Inuit across the country in the order of an additional $70 million that was announced earlier this year. EOS BOS In addition, we reached a deal with Saskatchewan, one of now nine provinces and three territories with which we have reached an agreement on mental health funding. EOS BOS In Saskatchewan's case, it was $150 million that will go to support expanding access to very real mental health needs in that province. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this has to be a world record in bad policy, and it is attracting more and more attention, both at home and around the world. EOS BOS Yesterday the United Nations published a report on global greenhouse gas emission trends. EOS BOS The Conservatives earned a special mention. EOS BOS They are lagging behind the most when it comes to combatting rising greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS The polluter pay system is long overdue. EOS BOS When will the minister table her emissions reduction targets for the oil and gas sectors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has taken action to address climate change. EOS BOS We introduced new emissions regulations for vehicles. EOS BOS We are the first major coal user to ban construction of traditional coal-fired power plants. EOS BOS Thanks to our actions, carbon emissions will go down close to 130 megatonnes from what they would have been under the Liberals. EOS BOS We are accomplishing this without the NDP carbon tax, which would have raised the cost of everything. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the only thing under the current Conservative government that we are leading at is failing on acting on climate change. EOS BOS In this report, one of the authors said:Canada doesn't seem to fully grasp the risk that climate change poses to it...in its approach to climate change. EOS BOS That last answer is a perfect example of not grasping the situation. EOS BOS When will the minister start paying attention to science and actually take action on climate change? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is taking action on climate change. EOS BOS We contributed $1.2 billion to developing countries so that they can reduce their carbon emissions and adapt to changes. EOS BOS We are also a founding member of a major financial contributor to an international coalition taking action to reduce pollutants like black carbon. EOS BOS We have also made addressing these pollutants a priority under the Arctic Council chairmanship. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the Conservatives do not understand about the issue of fraud just as they do not seem to understand the issue of ethics. EOS BOS Let us look at our beleaguered Minister of Industry. EOS BOS Last week he was found guilty of giving preferential treatment to his buddy Rahim Jaffer. EOS BOS Now this week he is having trouble getting his story straight about that 2009 hunting trip with Marcel Aubut, who just happened to be lobbying Ottawa for $400 million to help build a hockey arena. EOS BOS Does the minister not see that there is a problem partying with a man who is hitting up the government for taxpayers' dollars? EOS BOS Does he need some kind of help, like some kind of ethical watch dog, to help him get through these basic issues? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been on many hunting trips and in all of them I have assumed my part of the cost. EOS BOS On the trip in question, I went there on my own, with my own car, and I brought my own equipment. EOS BOS The opposition should focus on what issues really matter to Canadians. EOS BOS Let me be clear. EOS BOS There was never any lobbying from Mr. Aubut, on my part, neither before nor during this hunting trip. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, sure, he picked up his sleeping bag at Canadian Tire. EOS BOS It is kind of hard to follow his logic because he says that getting busted for Rahim Jaffer is part of his ethical education. EOS BOS So was his hunting trip part of his summer camp experience? EOS BOS How about moving all those government offices over to his father-in-law's building? EOS BOS Is that about a family togetherness exercise?There is not a rule the Conservative government is not willing to break. EOS BOS When is it going to teach him a proper lesson and kick him out of cabinet? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, I have gone on many hunting trips in my life. EOS BOS As far as the one in 2009 is concerned, I covered my fair share of the cost, as I always do. EOS BOS I travelled to the site in my own car, with my own equipment. EOS BOS The opposition can ridicule that all they want, but the fact remains that I covered the cost of that trip. EOS BOS At no time did Mr. Aubut ever lobby me before or during that trip. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we knew that government centres were being relocated to buildings owned by partners of the Minister of Industry. EOS BOS We knew that he violated the Conflict of Interest Act and that he did not believe it was serious. EOS BOS We now know that the minister has no problem going to his friends' hunting camps even though his friends are actively involved in lobbying. EOS BOS The Minister of Industry is still in cabinet despite his serious errors of judgment. EOS BOS Will he finally resign, or will he continue to claim that breaking the law is no big deal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will say it once more for the hon. EOS BOS opposition member. EOS BOS He is saying that I was in conflict of interest in 2009 when I went on a hunting trip, but that is not the case. EOS BOS On the trip in question, I travelled in my own car. EOS BOS I paid my fair share of the expenses, as I have on all the other hunting trips I have been on. EOS BOS Mr. Aubut never lobbied me, either before or during this trip. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are currently jeopardizing the delicate economic situation in the regions. EOS BOS Cuts to several post offices in Quebec are completely destroying postal services in rural areas. EOS BOS Postal services are essential to our communities and contribute to their economic development. EOS BOS Will this government finally act responsibly and come up with ways to develop the services, instead of making them disappear? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the volume of mail fluctuates from province to province and year to year. EOS BOS Canada Post makes decisions on the number of hours worked based on those fluctuations. EOS BOS People who have a permanent job with Canada Post will keep their job with Canada Post. EOS BOS There are no job reductions, as the member has stated. EOS BOS We are committed to ensuring that all Canadians get the postal service they deserve. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the more people hear about Bill C-51, the more they oppose it. EOS BOS Ninety per cent of the witnesses who appeared before the committee agreed that Bill C-51 jeopardizes our rights and freedoms. EOS BOS Members of other parties have even changed their tune and plan to follow the NDP's lead. EOS BOS Only the leader of the third party would rather let the Prime Minister win than stick to his principles. EOS BOS Is the minister so easily distracted by clay pigeons that he really cannot see the consensus against his flawed legislation and the need to withdraw Bill C-51? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the committee members, who did important work over the past few weeks and heard from dozens of witnesses over many hours. EOS BOS Everyone agrees that it is important to ensure that terrorists cannot take advantage of our inability to share information between the various government agencies, to prevent terrorists from boarding planes, to shut town terrorist propaganda websites and to allow passport officers to report suspicious individuals to police. EOS BOS We are taking appropriate measures to keep Canadians safe. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder the Conservatives rushed Bill C-51 through. EOS BOS They could not stand the opposition coming even from their own base. EOS BOS The more Canadians have heard about Bill C-51, the more they oppose it. EOS BOS Even the Bloc has seen the light and will not vote for this dangerous legislation, and maybe even the Liberal leader will follow. EOS BOS My question is for the minister. EOS BOS After hearing overwhelming evidence that Bill C-51 is ineffective and poses a threat to our civil liberties, will he listen to Canadians and abandon this fatally flawed bill? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, there are so many good measures and checks and balances in this bill. EOS BOS I want to thank the member for having taken the time to listen to witnesses, such as the sister of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, members of the Muslim community, the security sector, and academics. EOS BOS All agree that it is important that we ensure that we have threat management measures so that we are able to prevent terrorists from using the gaps in our laws to arm Canadians. EOS BOS We can reassure Canadians that we are taking the measures necessary to protect them from terrorists. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a report has confirmed that the Canadian Forces are now involved in combat, despite the Prime Minister's formal commitment last fall that our soldiers would not be on the front lines. EOS BOS American troops are not painting targets for air strikes and are not authorized to accompany Iraqi troops to the front lines. EOS BOS These are the rules of engagement that the Prime Minister promised Canadians. EOS BOS Why did he mislead Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not true. EOS BOS The truth is that the NDP leader and the entire opposition are opposed to military missions to advise and assist Iraqi forces in fighting jihadist terrorists. EOS BOS It is true that our troops killed jihadist terrorists who fired on them. EOS BOS That is their mission. EOS BOS We are proud of our troops and we are behind them 100%. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, American troops are not allowed to paint targets for air strikes. EOS BOS They are not allowed to accompany Iraqi forces to the front lines. EOS BOS This is exactly what the Prime Minister promised would be the case for Canadian soldiers, and yet Canadian special forces are indeed being put on the front lines. EOS BOS Brigadier General Rouleau said that Canadians were going to the “the forward-most Iraqi fighting positions”. EOS BOS That is why they call it “ EOS BOS the front”.It is a simple question. EOS BOS When did the Prime Minister decide to send Canadian troops into combat? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said repeatedly, this is a robust mission to assist and advise the Iraqi forces. EOS BOS I know the NDP is against that. EOS BOS I know the opposition members think it is a terrible thing that we are actually standing up to jihadists. EOS BOS I know they think it is a terrible thing that some of these jihadists got killed when they fired on the Canadian military. EOS BOS I do not know what other militaries are doing, but I know that ours is doing exactly what this Parliament asked it to do, and that Canadians are behind it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the employment insurance reforms are generating negative reactions from both employers and workers. EOS BOS Across Quebec and the Maritimes, seasonal workers occupy a high percentage of what is referred to in the act as insurable employment. EOS BOS How can seasonal employers be assured that they will be able to rehire the employees they have already trained in their respective fields? EOS BOS Does the government have a plan for that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is making common sense changes to better connect Canadians with available jobs in their local areas that match their skills. EOS BOS In fact, in my riding of Simcoe—Grey, which has many seasonal workers, they are delighted with these changes because it means that there are opportunities for people to stay in their local area, utilizing their local skills and staying close to their families. EOS BOS These initiatives are clarifying, not changing, the responsibilities of Canadians who are collecting EI. EOS BOS For those who are unable to find employment, employment insurance will continue to be there for them, as it always has been. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' decision to close the Freshwater Institute is a step backward for freshwater research and will have a huge impact on the management of our fisheries. EOS BOS Scientists from Harvard, the Smithsonian and other top research centres have slammed the cut. EOS BOS This research helps us understand and manage the impact of pollution on our freshwater systems and our fishery. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives so afraid of knowledge? EOS BOS Why are they cutting the Freshwater Institute? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Fisheries and Oceans Canada will continue to support freshwater research across Canada. EOS BOS The Experimental Lakes facility has a lot to offer to non-governmental research labs involved in ecosystem manipulation research. EOS BOS We look forward to facilitating a transfer to a private organization. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first the Trojan Horse budget paves the way for treating our lakes and streams as dumping ponds. EOS BOS Then the government cuts the very programs that tell us why we need to be so careful. EOS BOS The Freshwater Institute has already led to breakthroughs on acid rain, hydro dams and the use of phosphorous, but now when we need it the most the government will ensure it disappears. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives throwing caution to the wind and ending this important scientific tool? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, Fisheries and Oceans will continue to support freshwater research across Canada. EOS BOS The department will no longer conduct research that requires whole-lake or whole-ecosystem manipulation. EOS BOS Departmental research on fresh water will continue in various locations across Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon. EOS BOS Prime Minister recalls being present when the former prime minister, Brian Mulroney, cited, as the scientific consensus on climate change, that:...humanity is conducting an unintended, uncontrolled, globally pervasive experiment whose ultimate consequences could be second only to a global nuclear war. EOS BOS The Minister of the Environment said that Kyoto is in the past. EOS BOS I would ask the Prime Minister not to leave Canadian leadership in the past and show one fraction of the commitment of the former prime minister, Brian Mulroney, to address this crisis. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, one thing is for sure. We do need to have leadership in the economy , and that is what this government stands for. EOS BOS We balance the economy with environmental protection. EOS BOS That balance is achievable, and we have a plan to achieve that. EOS BOS That is why Canada has a very strong action plan that is focused on reducing our emissions by 17% of 2005 levels by 2020. EOS BOS That is real leadership. EOS
BOS I would like to draw to the attention of hon. EOS BOS members the presence in the gallery of Her Excellency Malu Dreyer, President of the Federal Council, the Bundesrat, of the Federal Republic of Germany. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Hear, hear! EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie on a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the issue of RCMP suicides is serious and we must act now. EOS BOS According to experts, almost one in five officers could attempt to end his or her life. EOS BOS However, the RCMP does not carry out systematic investigations when an officer commits suicide, although there are more police officer deaths by suicide than in the line of duty. EOS BOS Does the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness have a report on the issue? EOS BOS What is the action plan to help RCMP members in distress? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the RCMP plays an important role in keeping Canadians safe. EOS BOS We have put in place measures to keep an even closer watch on the RCMP, through an oversight body. EOS BOS Unfortunately, we have not had the support of the New Democrats EOS BOS .We will continue to ensure that agencies are in place to oversee the RCMP and ensure that it fulfills its mandate and protects Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister misunderstands the question. EOS BOS What we are asking about here is the level of services to RCMP officers for mental health. EOS BOS It is even falling behind the inadequate levels for the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS Today the Assistant Commissioner of the RCMP admitted that 16 suicides of serving RCMP members that occurred in the last eight years have not been reviewed. EOS BOS Dr. Greg Passey notes that the level of suicides is now greater in the RCMP than in the Canadian Forces. EOS BOS RCMP officers are only allowed six therapy sessions without higher approval. EOS BOS Will the minister now allow RCMP officers to get additional professional mental health assistance without having to reveal themselves or their conditions to their superiors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the RCMP's role is to ensure that police officers have access to all the mental health programs and services they need. EOS BOS There are programs. EOS BOS We are working with veterans on mental health issues specifically. EOS BOS We will continue to do so to ensure that we are able to support them and that they can return to their positions or civilian life. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, according to a document obtained by the NDP under the Access to Information Act, 85% of the money in the enabling accessibility fund has gone to Conservative ridings. EOS BOS Coincidence? EOS BOS Not at all. EOS BOS Time and again successive governments have punished the people who did not vote for them. EOS BOS People are tired of the same old story. EOS BOS The Prime Minister promised to govern for all Canadians. EOS BOS When will he start doing so? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of this program, which has made more than 600 buildings accessible to people with disabilities. EOS BOS That is great. EOS BOS [English]The awards were made exactly in proportion to the applications received. EOS BOS We are very proud that more Canadians will have access to these facilities. EOS BOS It is too bad the NDP did not support this program when we brought it in. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that may be so. EOS BOS By the way, we voted against Duplessis's patronage. EOS BOS With so few Conservative MPs in Quebec, we are not surprised to learn that Quebec is not receiving its fair share. EOS BOS Less than $2 million has gone to the 75 Quebec ridings, but more than $57 million has gone to Conservative ridings. EOS BOS Where does it say that their strong mandate gives them the right to ignore and neglect thousands of Canadians living with a disability? EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives attacking the vulnerable? EOS BOS Why the double standard? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has done more than any other Canadian government to help the disabled. EOS BOS In addition to the enabling accessibility fund, there are programs that provide financial assistance to the families of the disabled. EOS BOS The enabling accessibility fund has already made more than 600 buildings accessible to the disabled. EOS BOS It is too bad the opposition did not support it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the people of Montreal and the south shore are increasingly concerned about the impact of a toll on the new Champlain Bridge. EOS BOS They still have questions. EOS BOS For example, how much will the toll cost? EOS BOS Once the toll is in place, how congested will the other bridges be?Other than saying, “no toll, no bridge EOS BOS ” could the minister once and for all answer our questions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say it again: no toll, no bridge. We will continue to work to ensure that a bridge is built to meet the needs of the greater Montreal area, with the ability to pay Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS We have done a great job. EOS BOS The business plan will be ready by the end of the year. EOS BOS Among other things, it will analyze 13 different architecture and engineering scenarios for the bridge construction. EOS BOS We are working hard and we will honour our commitments. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, even more disturbing than the minister's failure to provide answers is the fact that his government has circumvented its own rules for awarding contracts. EOS BOS A sum of $15 million was awarded to Arup Canada without a tendering process. EOS BOS Untendered contracts often mean cronyism and corruption. EOS BOS Not only did they not hold an international architecture competition, but furthermore, they loaded the dice. EOS BOS Why did the minister decide to ignore the competitive process? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the firm in question has been working on the bridge file for quite a while now, along with the company that was awarded the contract for the business plan. EOS BOS These people are hard at work. EOS BOS Recently, a report from the highly reputable firm Buckland & Taylor raised additional and significant concerns about the bridge. EOS BOS We took this very seriously. EOS BOS Officials from Public Works and Government Services Canada have managed this file with Transport Canada. EOS BOS While my colleague is concerned about the work involved in these things, we are concerned about his vote when the time comes to invest in this bridge. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians in my riding of York South—Weston and across the country are increasingly worried about rail safety. EOS BOS As it turns out, they are right to be concerned. EOS BOS Instead of putting safety first, the minister has let big rail companies cut corners, skip safety inspections, and be exempt from some brake tests. EOS BOS In one case, they went six months without a complete brake test. EOS BOS Why were these exemptions allowed, and why is the minister refusing to come clean with Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member will know that Transport Canada, in 2012, did more than 30,000 inspections on rail safety. EOS BOS Our government has invested over $100 million in our rail safety system. EOS BOS We continue to hire more inspectors as we speak, increase fines for companies found to break our regulations, and create a whistleblower protection that requires each railway to have an executive legally responsible for safety. EOS BOS The list goes on. EOS BOS The member should get on board with this rail safety regime. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the people of Vaudreuil—Soulanges want to see some transparency, not listen to more rhetoric. EOS BOS This is important information. EOS BOS After what happened in Lac-Mégantic, we expect and are calling for more transparency from the minister. EOS BOS Transport Canada chose to grant exemptions to rail companies on matters as crucial as brake tests and safety inspections. EOS BOS Is the minister going to keep withholding information about the number of exemptions granted and which safety regulations were involved? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have the numbers on rail safety inspections. EOS BOS There are some 30,000—a historic level, I would add—on our rail safety system. EOS BOS There are major investments in our rail safety. EOS BOS Since Lac-Mégantic, as the member referenced that particular tragedy, there have been ongoing actions by the minister, such as new sharing of information with municipality directives, proper classification and better classification of what is travelling by rail, new recommendations to the minister on emergency response action plans for flammable goods, and the list goes on and on. EOS BOS The member should support that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives refuse to invest in order to save trains in eastern Quebec and New Brunswick. Voting for the right party does not even help. EOS BOS We have not heard a peep from the members for Moncton, Miramichi and Madawaska—Restigouche. EOS BOS We need to work together to ensure the future of VIA Rail. EOS BOS It is essential to economic development in the east and the rest of Canada. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives going to stay asleep at the switch or are they going to do something to save the trains? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member will know that this was a business decision made by a private company, CN. EOS BOS There is a regulatory process in place, which the company is currently following. EOS BOS While the discontinuance process is under way, CN is responsible for maintaining its track infrastructure. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our rail service is collapsing, and the Conservatives are still refusing to act. EOS BOS The railway in New Brunswick is crucial. EOS BOS It is the only direct line for thousands of people in eastern Quebec. EOS BOS It is the only route that links Canada from coast to coast. EOS BOS Will the minister come to our community and explain to the people why they are losing this service, a service that Canadians are proud of? EOS BOS Shame on the Conservatives. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, apparently the member opposite does not know that Halifax is on the coast and the Ocean line continues to run from Halifax to Montreal and to points well beyond that. EOS BOS When it comes to VIA Rail and support for VIA Rail, we have invested $1 billion since 2007 in capital investments and $275 million across the network in 2013. EOS BOS What did that member say in the House last night? EOS BOS He said he was proud to vote against every dollar of it. EOS BOS Shame on him. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, at the same time the government is cutting back on employment insurance to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of people across the country, it is also raising the cost of employment insurance to claimants, to all employees and employers across the country. EOS BOS I wonder if the Prime Minister would now consider, given the slow rate of growth in the economy here and everywhere else in the western world, getting rid of this proposed increased in the EI tax. EOS </s> BOS Of course, Mr. Speaker, the rates charged for employment insurance vary over time to create a balance in the program. EOS BOS It is the premiums that cover the cost of the program. EOS BOS That is why the government thinks it is so important not to artificially inflate the size of the EI program. EOS BOS I know the Liberal Party wants to create a 45-day work year under EI across the country. EOS BOS That would drive rates for employees and employers through the roof, increasing them by some 35%. EOS BOS We think that is inappropriate. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's cuts to employment insurance are affecting workers, especially seasonal workers, as well as employers, especially in the tourism and fisheries sectors. EOS BOS Not to mention, they have been very costly for the provinces. EOS BOS So who is benefiting from these changes? EOS BOS Certainly not workers, employers or the provinces. EOS BOS Basically, nobody benefits. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the Liberal leader is saying is absolutely not true. EOS BOS Clearly, the objective of this government is not to offer employment insurance to everyone, but rather to create jobs for everyone. EOS BOS I am very pleased to see that the Canadian economy has created over 900,000 net new jobs. EOS BOS That is significant. EOS BOS However, for those who cannot find work, the employment insurance program will remain in place to protect them and their communities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to protecting our streets and communities, Canadian know who they can trust. EOS BOS Since 2006, we have toughened laws, held violent criminals to account, and most importantly, have stood up for victims of crime. EOS BOS In response to the Supreme Court's decision on Bedford, we brought in new criminal provisions to protect vulnerable Canadians from the harms of prostitution. EOS BOS The opposition dragged their feet and ultimately voted against the legislation. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Justice tell the House the kind of impact our legislation is having on communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate members of the RCMP, who recently conducted raids to break up an international prostitution ring. EOS BOS They identified hundreds of potential victims who were being forced into prostitution, an inherently dangerous life. EOS BOS At least 500 victims, mostly young women, were moved around the country and forced into sexual slavery in many Canadian cities. EOS BOS Through the investigation, although it is ongoing, six individuals have been charged with charges recently enacted by our government. EOS BOS Canadians trust this government to protect Canadians in our communities, where they work, live, and raise their families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while we are tossing these kind words around, the people in the Montérégie region have been up to their necks in water for the past 50 days. EOS BOS While we are tossing these kind words around, the Prime Minister is showing as much empathy as someone having a tooth pulled without anaesthetic. EOS BOS Why does the Prime Minister not want to make an exception for Quebec, which is asking that the army play a role in the cleanup?In 1998, Jean Chrétien called Lucien Bouchard to see what was needed. EOS BOS People want help from the army. EOS BOS What has happened to them is not their fault. EOS BOS Instead of being attacked, they want people to come help them clean up. EOS BOS What are they waiting for? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, along with the hon. EOS BOS member and all Canadians, we are very sympathetic to the plight of those affected by the floods not only in Quebec but in Manitoba, as well those who are suffering in Saskatchewan. EOS BOS As members know, the Prime Minister has been in the region this morning. EOS BOS We have Canadian soldiers who have been on the ground within 24 hours after being contacted by the Province of Quebec. EOS BOS They continue to work with the province to the best of their ability to help mitigate the damage there, continuing their efforts as we speak. EOS BOS There are 500 soldiers there currently and we congratulate them on that incredible effort. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, people in Montérégie are struggling with the worst flooding that this region has ever seen. EOS BOS After 50 days, when the Prime Minister finally showed up in the region, we learned that, unlike disaster victims in Manitoba and Alberta, people in the Montérégie region still cannot get expedited processing of their employment insurance claims. EOS BOS Why does this double standard exist for the people of Montérégie? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government understands the difficulties and the stress that the disaster victims are experiencing in the Montérégie region. EOS BOS That is why we have expedited processing of their employment insurance claims. EOS BOS Once I learned about the situation, I made a request to the department. EOS BOS Information is now available on our website. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, back home, the entire Montérégie region is flooded. EOS BOS The people are exhausted. EOS BOS The government thought it was more important to expedite employment insurance to disaster victims in Manitoba and Alberta, and victims in Quebec have been ignored until now. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development explain why disaster victims in the Montérégie region are still waiting for this expedited assistance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, natural disaster victims across Canada must receive the same support from their government, regardless of where they live. EOS BOS That is why, as soon as I learned about this situation, I asked the department to ensure that the victims of flooding in the Montérégie region immediately receive the same priority processing for employment insurance claims as victims in the rest of Canada. EOS BOS That priority processing is available immediately, and information is available on our website. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Kermit the Frog once said, “ EOS BOS It's not easy being green”. EOS BOS The Liberals are proving that. EOS BOS Last week, they passed a motion that said that projects must be run through a green screen to gauge their impact on greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS If a project is not green enough it could be punted. EOS BOS With this policy, good luck building new roads, freeways, or bridges for vehicles. EOS BOS Many major projects could croak under the weight of this Kermit permit. EOS BOS How will the Liberals build anything, given this ill-conceived policy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I was in British Columbia on Friday to announce 35 projects for water and waste water infrastructure in the province. We have approved more than 700 projects since taking over. EOS BOS As a matter of fact, in the last four months our government has approved more funding than the previous government did in five years combined. EOS BOS We are delivering on the commitments we made to Canadians. EOS BOS We will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, hundreds of thousands of good jobs in the manufacturing sector have been lost under the Conservatives' watch since they came to power. EOS BOS In the past few months, tens of thousands more jobs have been lost in the retail sector. EOS BOS Just last weekend, 1,500 jobs were lost at Future Shop. EOS BOS There is a reason why the Governor of the Bank of Canada is forecasting atrocious quarterly results. EOS BOS That was the word he used: “atrocious“. EOS BOS That is the Conservatives' record. EOS BOS Instead of complaining about the temperature of the Camembert on their first-class flights, when are the Conservatives going to help the middle class? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are helping the middle class by putting money directly into families' pockets. EOS BOS This week, the leader of the NDP said that families whose children do not attend government day care, have no child care costs. EOS BOS He thinks that families who keep their children at home, or send them to relatives or neighbours have no child care costs. EOS BOS He should apologize to those families. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have also neglected the tourism industry. EOS BOS Tourism is responsible for over 600,000 jobs in Canada, but over the last decade, Canada has dropped nine places as an international tourism destination, from seventh to a shameful sixteenth place. EOS BOS Under pressure, the Conservatives have finally decided to talk about recapturing the U.S. tourism market, but why did it take so long, and why do we still not have plan? EOS BOS Will the minister tell us exactly how much money will be invested in the connecting America campaign? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that NDP members at least took some time to read the budget. They know that we are putting more money into the tourism industry and more money into U.S. advertising. EOS BOS It is very true. EOS BOS This is good news. EOS BOS Members in the industry asked us to put more money into the U.S. to attract more U.S. travellers to Canada. EOS BOS That is something we are going to do. EOS BOS It is a done deal. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives sat on their hands when American tourists started deserting Canada. EOS BOS The Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism even boasted about cutting the budget of the Canadian Tourism Commission, an agency that helps promote our industry abroad. EOS BOS This morning I moved a motion at the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to point out that in Quebec City alone, tourism employs 15,000 people. EOS BOS It employs 600,000 people throughout Canada. EOS BOS We want a number. EOS BOS Can the Conservatives tell us how much they will invest in order to repair the damage they have done? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the tourism industry is an $89 billion industry in Canada. EOS BOS It is a very important industry, and that is why, last fall, my provincial colleagues and I reached a Canada-wide consensus. EOS BOS It was not the NDP that did that. EOS BOS It was our government that reached a consensus with the provinces to ensure that there is reinvestment in the United States. EOS BOS That is what we are going to do because we want more travellers from the United States to come and visit our beautiful and great country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has cost Canada some $300 million to close Camp Mirage in the UAE. EOS BOS We now learn that the Minister of National Defence is planning to open a base in Kuwait, some 400 miles further away from Afghanistan. EOS BOS Will the minister tell Canadian taxpayers how much this reopening will cost in addition to the already $300 million sunk because of a turf war between the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Foreign Affairs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the new defence critic for the Liberal Party and assure him that relations between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and I are on good terms.I can also tell the member that his figures are completely wrong. EOS BOS Those numbers are completely false. EOS BOS What we have done, obviously, is to make arrangements to have logistic hubs in parts of the Middle East that allow us to continue the logistic support for the ongoing mission in Afghanistan. EOS BOS That is the intention of the department, nothing more than that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning we witnessed the sad spectacle of Senator Brazeau's court appearance. EOS BOS The Conservative senator appointed by the Prime Minister was already under investigation for theft from the Senate and income tax fraud. EOS BOS He exhibited sexism toward a journalist and insulted aboriginal leaders. EOS BOS The Prime Minister has not yet admitted that giving Senator Brazeau a job for life was a mistake. EOS BOS Will he acknowledge his mistake now and make sure that taxpayers get back the money that was stolen from them? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, because of the seriousness of these events and charges, he was expelled from caucus. EOS BOS The legal system will handle this matter. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if Senator Brazeau serves his full term until 2049, he will collect over $7 million in salary alone. EOS BOS He is the Prime Minister's $7 million mistake. EOS BOS He cannot stop his salary, but he can stop this unelected senator from collecting illegitimate living expenses. EOS BOS What is the government's plan to return the money to the taxpayers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in light of the serious charges that have been laid, he has been removed from the caucus and, of course, the legal system will proceed forthwith on those matters. EOS BOS In terms of housing allowances and the like, the committee on internal economy over at the Senate has, of course, been seized of these matters. EOS BOS Today several were referred to an independent outside auditor to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately through independent oversight. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not that hard to admit to a major blunder. EOS BOS They knew that guy had a shady past, but they appointed him to the Senate anyway. EOS BOS The Conservatives carry on digging into their bottomless pit of hypocrisy. EOS BOS The Prime Minister called the Senate a “relic of the 19th century”, but then he changed his tune and appointed more senators than Mulroney did. EOS BOS Taxpayers are now on the hook for millions so that the Prime Minister's friends and generous Conservative Party supporters can sit pretty for the rest of their lives. EOS BOS Why not just abolish this archaic, undemocratic institution that is about as obsolete as phonographs and street lamp lighters? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, our government has been pursuing an ambitious agenda of democratic reform changes to the Senate. EOS BOS In fact, our Prime Minister has appointed every single democratically elected senator when he has had an opportunity to do so, including one just a couple of weeks ago. EOS BOS We would encourage all provinces to provide the opportunity for democratically elected senators to be appointed to the Senate. EOS BOS We would also encourage the other parties that have consistently opposed such changes to modernize and democratize our important parliamentary institutions to change their positions and actually support real reforms that will make the Senate accountable to all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, without prior consultation, last May Conservatives announced they were closing marine communications stations in Comox, Tofino and Vancouver. EOS BOS Then they announced they were shutting down the Kitsilano Coast Guard station, the busiest in the country. EOS BOS Those were two decisions imposed on British Columbia and no consultation. EOS BOS Police and fire chiefs, search and rescue officials, mayors and even the premier of British Columbia all warned this was a dangerous idea. EOS BOS People's lives will be put at risk. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives not listening to British Columbia? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I have addressed both of these issues many times. EOS BOS With regard to the Kitsilano question, Vancouver will have an abundance of federally-funded search and rescue assets available to protect and save lives. EOS BOS In fact, British Columbia is served by 13 search and rescue lifeboats, two hovercrafts and two helicopters. EOS BOS Changes in Vancouver will have no negative impact on our ability to respond quickly and effectively to distress incidents on the water. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Monday, a fishing vessel en route from St. Anthony to Triton, Newfoundland, became engulfed in flames. EOS BOS Three fishermen had to evacuate the ship after making a mayday call. EOS BOS That call was received by St. Anthony Coast Guard radio and St. John's Coast Guard radio, both of which government had slated to close. EOS BOS It was the element of local knowledge and coordination that allowed for a successful rescue operation. EOS BOS I ask the government today to admit that slashing search and rescue services is putting lives of people at risk. EOS BOS Will more people have to die before the government reverses those decisions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank private citizen Terry Ryan and the other private citizens who responded to the call. I also want to thank the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces personnel for being involved in this rescue which saved three people, thankfully. EOS BOS The fact that a private vessel responded after mayday calls were issued by both the burning vessel and the Canadian Coast Guard and they were first on site is an example of how the mayday system works well. EOS BOS The closest vessel headed out to the disaster. EOS BOS The mayday was issued at 6:20 a.m. and in nine minutes a Hercules from Greenwood, a Coast Guard ship out of Lewisporte, and a helicopter out of Gander were tasked with responding. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Official Languages has asked the government several times to introduce a bill to clarify the responsibilities of Air Canada and its affiliates with regard to providing services in French and English. EOS BOS In May 2010, 252 hon. EOS BOS members unanimously called on the government to do the same. EOS BOS The minister's two immediate predecessors promised to do so, but did not. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Transport keep his government's promise or will he follow the other two and prove the old saying, “ EOS BOS Bad things come in threes”? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the hon. EOS BOS member knows, Air Canada is responsible for meeting its official language requirements with its partner companies. EOS BOS We are ensuring that the official languages are respected and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, sadly, the Conservatives' lack of accountability extends to maternal and child health as well. EOS BOS They lecture other countries, but they cannot produce proper statistics about maternal and child health in Canada, and they put ideological restrictions on the funding. EOS BOS Making commitments is a good start, but the real test is whether they follow through and the kind of impact they have. EOS BOS Will the government ensure that there are a full range of family planning options available to these women and girls? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has taken a leadership role in addressing the health challenges faced by women, newborns, and children in the world's poorest countries. EOS BOS Let me give this member some good results here. EOS BOS Thanks to Canada's global leadership, over 700,000 more children live to their fifth birthdays in 2011 than in 2010. EOS BOS Let me say that in over 125 countries, maternal death rates have declined sharply in the past five years. EOS BOS Between 2010 and 2013, an estimated two million deaths from disease were prevented. EOS BOS If that is not a good record, then I do not know what the member is talking about. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' ideological stubbornness is appalling. EOS BOS They refuse to contribute to the United Nations Population Fund because the fund supports family planning and reproductive health, which are topics that make their anti-choice friends unhappy. EOS BOS However, 800 women die every day in developing countries as a result of pregnancies, deliveries or botched abortions. EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives refuse to fund these groups that provide safe and legal treatment, particularly in the case of rape? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians believe in achieving results, not just in rhetoric, like what the New Democrats are talking about. EOS BOS Let me say what I just said. EOS BOS At this time, the Prime Minister is in Toronto with other world leaders talking about women's, newborns' and children's health. EOS BOS That initiative has saved the lives of over 1.3 million children and newborns as well as more than 60,000 young mothers. EOS BOS If that is not a result, then I do not know what is. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, promising money is all well and good, but it is even better to ensure that this money is well spent. EOS BOS Four years after the Muskoka announcement, we still do not know how much money was spent or where it was spent. EOS BOS The Lancet recently criticized the Conservatives' financial opacity. EOS BOS Even the UN is unable to get a full picture of the commitments made in 2010. EOS BOS After the Muskoka boondoggle, how can we believe the Conservatives when they promise more transparency with respect to development assistance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me give some facts to my hon. EOS BOS colleague on the other side. EOS BOS In 2013, the Publish What You Fund Aid Transparency Index placed the former CIDA, now part of DFAIT Canada, eighth among the 67 donor organizations and third among bilateral agencies in meeting their commitments. EOS BOS If that is not the best result for Canada, I do not know what kind of results the NDP is looking for. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we all know that when it comes time to listen to the advice of the departments, the Conservatives like to add their own personal touch. EOS BOS Clearly, the Minister of Canadian Heritage spends a little too much time with his colleague, the Minister of International Cooperation, because now he likes to interfere in these kinds of affairs. EOS BOS I have here the unbelievable decision to ignore the recommendation to designate Tadoussac and Rouyn-Noranda as cultural capitals of Canada. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because the minister decided to favour the City of Calgary, which was not even on the selection committee's shortlist. EOS BOS Why did the minister go against his department recommendation to list these two Quebec cities as cultural capitals of Canada? EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were proud to name Niagara Falls and Calgary the cultural capitals for 2012. EOS BOS It is sad that the opposition constantly tries to pit Canadians against each other. EOS BOS We received several nominations for cities that wanted to be listed as cultural capitals, but only a few can actually be named. EOS BOS There were two quality nominations. EOS BOS Having said this, Rouyn-Noranda and Tadoussac will receive funding for cultural events that will take place this year. EOS BOS Tadoussac will receive funding for the Festival de la chanson in 2012, 2013 and 2014. EOS BOS Rouyn-Noranda will receive funding for the 36th and 37th editions of Salon du livre. EOS BOS They will be getting money. EOS BOS It is also true that the NDP voted against this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is the minister who is pitting one city against another. EOS BOS When you play with the rules to help your friends, it smacks of bad faith and favouritism. EOS BOS After spending several years putting together their applications, Tadoussac and Rouyn-Noranda are going to have to look elsewhere in order to fund their projects. EOS BOS The mayors of these two Quebec cities were told that their bids were not good and that they did not meet the criteria. EOS BOS Yet, officials said that the two towns qualified, and even recommended them. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages tell us why he decided that these two cities’ bids were not good enough? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I just said, there were certainly quality nominations, but there are limits to the amount of money available for these types of events. EOS BOS This year, Calgary and Niagara Falls were named cultural capitals. EOS BOS Last year, Lévis, Quebec, got this designation. EOS BOS Another year, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, was listed. EOS BOS And one year, it was Saint-Jean EOS BOS .We will continue to conduct this type of analysis, but in the future, we will support events that are responsible, and that have good local projects. EOS BOS It is true that this year, those two cities were not designated cultural capitals, but, once again, we will fund good quality community events that benefit the people in these regions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the IMF predicts that Canada's economic growth rate will be lower than the combined growth rate of the G7 in the next four years. EOS BOS The last time this happened for four consecutive years was under the Mulroney Conservatives. EOS BOS The IMF also says that the government has some flexibility in how it makes investments if it really wants to improve the economy. EOS BOS Given all the challenges facing the middle class, will this government really table a budget that contains no new investments? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite had actually taken the time to read the report, he would have seen that the IMF speaks strongly of Canada's economic performance. EOS BOS As the report clearly states, “...the IMF expects growth to accelerate above potential in 2014”. EOS BOS Furthermore, the IMF praised our government's economic and fiscal management. EOS BOS In fact, it said, “Executive directors commended the authorities for their continued sound macroeconomic and financial sector management”.Clearly, our plan is working. EOS BOS In fact, just today, Statistics Canada announced that another 29,400 net new jobs were created in January. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that the government created a big deficit and is now obsessed with eliminating it. EOS BOS However, middle-class households are struggling right now. EOS BOS In fact, household debt has increased 75% in the eight years the government has been in power. EOS BOS It is now almost 100% of GDP. EOS BOS Families owe $1.64 for every $1 they earn. EOS BOS In light of this, is the government really planning to table a budget that would do nothing for middle-class families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we clearly do not want Canadians to be over-extended. We have cautioned Canadians repeatedly that interest rates are now at an all-time low and will inevitably increase. EOS BOS Our priority is ensuring that Canadians can make informed financial decisions. EOS BOS Unlike the Liberals, who have voted against every piece of consumer protection legislation our government has introduced, we have taken concrete action to help Canadians better manage their money. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that this government is obsessed with eliminating the huge deficit that it itself created. EOS BOS However, middle-class families are still struggling under the Conservatives. EOS BOS Household debt has gone up 75% in the eight long years under the Conservative government. EOS BOS The national debt is almost 100% of our GDP and families owe $1.64 for every dollar they earn. EOS BOS Why is this government planning another budget that will do nothing for middle-class families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio of any G7 country by far. EOS BOS As I mentioned, we have taken concrete action to help Canadians better manage their money. EOS BOS We introduced credit card reforms to ensure that Canadians have access to important information. EOS BOS We strengthened mortgage rules to protect Canadians buying a home. EOS BOS We cut taxes and created the tax-free savings account, the most successful savings account in Canadian history. EOS BOS Over 9 million Canadians now take advantage of it. EOS BOS To encourage Canadians to save for their future, we created a financial literacy leader to oversee our progress. EOS BOS It is about time the Liberals get on side and support our successful policies. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the unemployment rate is on the rise again. EOS BOS For the second month in a row on the Conservatives' watch, Canada has lost jobs. EOS BOS Some 19,000 jobs were lost in November. EOS BOS Will the government finally accept the fact that its inaction plan is not working? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, while we saw full-time job gains in November, we are of course disappointed that the overall job figures show, because of part-time job losses, a drop in employment of some 19,000. EOS BOS We do sympathize with all Canadians who have lost their jobs. EOS BOS That said, after we emerged from the recession, we have still seen significant increases in jobs in Canada since the economic downturn took hold. EOS BOS That is in very stark contrast to most of our companion developed economies. EOS BOS That is actually evidence that our economic action plan is working. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the continuing cost to our economy of this high level of unemployment is in the billions. EOS BOS It is unsustainable, yet the Conservatives stubbornly want to give even more money to non-performing corporations. EOS BOS There are 1.4 million people unemployed in Canada, and 19,000 jobs were lost in November. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop applauding the loss of jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we are working to implement our low-tax plan for jobs and growth, which is aimed at delivering jobs and opportunities for Canadians. EOS BOS We recently had votes in this House on the next phase of that economic action plan, seeking to deliver things like a job creation tax credit. EOS BOS That member voted against that job creation tax credit. EOS BOS He is the one who does not care about creating jobs. EOS BOS We took action by extending the accelerated capital cost allowance that allows Canadian companies to invest in equipment to make them more competitive, to allow them to continue to function, to create jobs, to do better on the world stage, to be able to export more. EOS BOS Again, the NDP voted against that effort to make our workers more competitive. EOS BOS We are the ones focused on creating jobs. EOS BOS That is why Canada is healthy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to see that the Conservatives' economic inaction plan is hurting Quebec the most. EOS BOS In Quebec, 31,000 jobs have been lost, half of which were full time. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives going to stop pretending that everything is just fine? EOS BOS People are suffering. EOS BOS There is no cause for celebration. EOS BOS Will the government adjust its focus and come up with a real job creation plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers understand that the global economy is currently facing major challenges. EOS BOS Fortunately, Canada has an economic action plan that has created more than half a million jobs since the end of the depression. EOS BOS That is the success of our economic action plan. EOS BOS We intend to focus on the economy and job creation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the oil sands create hundreds of thousands of jobs in communities right across Canada. EOS BOS We notice the Conservatives clap for that because our government knows that Canadians benefit from resource development. EOS BOS We have been clear that the Keystone XL project will create fantastic jobs for Canadians and tremendous growth in our economy. EOS BOS Could the parliamentary secretary please update the House on the work the minister is doing to support Canadian jobs and add to the quality of life for Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Natural Resources is in Washington today, advocating for Canadian jobs in our resource sector. EOS BOS The difference between our approach and that of the NDP could not be more stark. EOS BOS While our government is focused on creating jobs and economic growth for Canada, the NDP attacks Canadian jobs. EOS BOS While we support Canadian workers, the NDP continues its anti-trade, anti-development, and anti-resource agenda. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this week dozens of iron workers in northern Alberta were laid off, only to see their jobs filled temporarily by foreign workers being paid less than half what they were making. EOS BOS The Conservatives know full well that some companies are continuing to abuse the temporary foreign worker program. EOS BOS What is the minister doing to investigate and to help these iron workers get their jobs back? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the allegations in question are very troubling. EOS BOS We have instructed officials to review this case on an urgent basis. EOS BOS Our government wants to make sure Canadians get first crack at any job that is available. EOS BOS That is why we have made important changes to the temporary foreign worker program, and that is why we continue to review it. EOS BOS Make no mistake. EOS BOS Any employer who tries to abuse the temporary foreign worker program will be held to account. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here is what some of those changes have caused. EOS BOS The abuse of the temporary foreign worker program has become a fiasco under the government. EOS BOS It created the Alberta occupation specific pilot project, which allows companies to hire foreign workers without accurate labour market opinions. EOS BOS These giant loopholes allow companies to abuse the program. EOS BOS When will the minister stand up, apologize to these workers for failing to protect their jobs, and fix the temporary foreign worker program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the fact is that we are the government that is making changes to the temporary foreign worker program to make sure it is more accountable. EOS BOS It does not help when NDP members continually ask us to bring temporary foreign workers into their ridings. EOS BOS The NDP deputy leader and MP for Vancouver East has been asking us to do that. EOS BOS The NDP MP for Halifax, the MP for Ottawa Centre, and the MP for Thunder Bay—Rainy River have been asking us to do that. EOS BOS I have a whole list. EOS BOS That is not helping. EOS BOS We want Canadians to get first crack at every job that is available in this country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Shoal Lake aboriginal community was forced to declare a state of emergency because the ferry that connects it to the shore, the only way in and out of the reserve, is in such poor condition that it failed the Transport Canada inspection. EOS BOS The community, which has been under a boil water advisory for 17 years, has been asking for a long-term solution for years. EOS BOS Will the minister intervene immediately so that the community can lift the state of emergency? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our immediate priority is to ensure the health and safety of Shoal Lake residents. EOS BOS That is why our emergency management team is in constant contact with the community. EOS BOS We will continue to offer help if the community needs it. EOS BOS To date, we have received no requests for help. EOS BOS However, we are also working with the aboriginal community and Health Canada to ensure that residents have access to medical services. EOS BOS We stand ready to provide any help required. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister's response to emergencies is always too little, too late. EOS BOS The state of emergency in Shoal Lake has been years in the making. EOS BOS Shoal Lake was cut off from the mainland in order to provide Winnipeg with clean drinking water, leaving Shoal Lake residents dependent on an unreliable ferry and dangerous ice roads. EOS BOS For 17 straight years, they have been under a boil-water advisory. EOS BOS They need a year-round road to the mainland and potable water. EOS BOS Why has the Conservative government continued to fail first nation communities like Kashechewan and Shoal Lake? EOS BOS When will the Conservatives finally take real action on infrastructure needs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government continues to take action so that first nations across Canada have the same quality of drinking water as all Canadians. EOS BOS That is why since 2006, approximately $3 billion have been invested in first nations' water and waste water infrastructure and related public health activities. EOS BOS We have made targeted investments in more than 130 major projects and have funded the maintenance of over 1,200 water and waste water treatment projects, and we will continue in that vein. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives were roundly criticized in a respected defence association report for their abject failure on procurement. EOS BOS Instead of creating thousands of skilled jobs and delivering the planes, ships, and trucks that our troops need, Conservatives have betrayed them. EOS BOS Last night, aerospace leaders from the west were in Ottawa begging for a better and faster process. EOS BOS Our troops, our industry, and Canadians are paying the price. EOS BOS Could the minister please tell us the price tag for all of their procurement failures, delays, resets, and cancellations over eight lost years? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, our government is very proud of the many successful military procurements that we have been able to achieve over the last several years, including new LAVs, heavy-lift aircraft, tactical-lift transporters, main battle tanks, and new heavy artillery. EOS BOS The military lived under a decade of darkness under the Liberals prior to us forming government. EOS BOS We are delivering, as a priority, the equipment that our men and women in uniform need to do their jobs, and we will be doing it in a way that is responsible to taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has just renewed an anemic housing agreement with the Province of Ontario. EOS BOS The province said thanks because it has good manners, not because it is a good policy. EOS BOS In Toronto, this policy means that only 60 new units of apartments will be built in the next year, even though there is a waiting list in the city of 92,000 people waiting for housing. EOS BOS The mayor of Toronto said this week that he needs more help, not the status quo. EOS BOS In fact, the city is now losing almost 250 units of housing a year while it waits for the federal government to act. EOS BOS The question is this. EOS BOS Why is the Minister of Finance going to Toronto and speaking at a private club, making one of his colleagues rich, instead of being in the House, providing housing money, and helping people in need? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first of all, I did not realize that the member now speaks for the provincial Government of Ontario, because I can tell him that when I met and signed agreements with the minister of housing from Ontario, they were very pleased with our housing agreements. EOS BOS Do members know why? EOS BOS It is because we provide funding, it matches funding, and then it decides where the funding goes. EOS BOS It is called working with the provinces. EOS BOS It is called making our role as the federal government have the greatest impact, but working with provinces. EOS BOS I would like to explain that to the member. EOS BOS I think he would understand it if we had a little more time to explain that simple matter to him. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservative economic plan is failing Canada. EOS BOS Under its mismanagement, we just posted another record trade deficit, swelling to $3 billion in March alone. EOS BOS The Conservative plan is also failing families that face layoffs and growing job uncertainty while struggling with rising costs, and still the Conservatives have no plan to create even a single affordable child care space. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop ignoring the needs of Canadian families and deliver the NDP's plan for $15 a day child care? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what we recognize is that families across the country have a variety of child care needs. EOS BOS We refuse to dictate to Canadian families how they should be looking after their children. EOS BOS We refuse to say that, if they are not using a licensed daycare spot, they do not deserve support. EOS BOS That is not what we are saying. EOS BOS That is what the NDP says. EOS BOS What we are saying is that every family in the country with children deserves support. EOS BOS That is what we are delivering in tax cuts, in direct benefits, and in other tax benefits, like our child fitness tax credit. EOS BOS We are supporting families. EOS BOS We are supporting their right to choose how they look after their children. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the indirect costs of research are severely penalizing Canada's universities. EOS BOS By reimbursing only 21.5% of those costs, the Conservatives are putting our universities at risk of not balancing their books. EOS BOS Quebec universities alone are underfunded by $113 million annually. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Industry improve the program and cover 40% of the indirect costs of research, as was planned in 2003? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government remains committed to supporting science, technology, and innovation. EOS BOS That is why we are working with post-secondary institutions to re-evaluate the indirect costs program. EOS BOS We want to ensure that taxpayers' money is managed wisely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last month Canada lost more than 30,000 full-time jobs, adding to the more than 1.3 million Canadians looking for work, yet the Conservatives have used their budget bill to kill a job-creation measure that over a half million small businesses used just last year. EOS BOS The CFIB has championed this credit as a win-win, as it supports small businesses and helps create the good-paying jobs that Canadians need. EOS BOS Therefore, will the Conservatives listen to small business owners and the NDP and back off from their plan to kill the small business hiring credit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member opposite seems to have forgotten that the NDP voted against the hiring credit. EOS BOS This credit was always meant to be temporary. EOS BOS It helped small businesses that were struggling during the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. EOS BOS We recognize the vital role that small business plays in the economy and job creation, which is why we have frozen EI premiums for three years, putting $660 million into the pockets of job creators and workers last year alone. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are hurting SMEs by abolishing the hiring tax credit. EOS BOS Moreover, they are not doing anything about limiting credit card transaction fees. EOS BOS They have essentially abandoned SMEs. EOS BOS The NDP is proposing meaningful solutions for our SMEs. EOS BOS We have proposed that we partner with them and consult them. EOS BOS That is completely different from what the Conservatives do. EOS BOS Why do they Conservatives continue to ignore the needs of our real job creators? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hiring credit, which the NDP voted against, was always designed to be temporary assistance for small businesses. EOS BOS As for credit cards, we have heard the concerns of small businesses and we introduced a code of conduct. EOS BOS This code was welcomed by consumers and industry groups, in particular by small businesses. EOS BOS We are always listening to small businesses. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in addition to making the unemployed accept lower-paying jobs that are further from home, the employment insurance reform announced last Thursday risks doing much worse. EOS BOS By forcing employees trained by seasonal businesses to go elsewhere, it will deprive employers of the skilled labour they need to maintain their activities. EOS BOS This is a direct attack on the fishery, tourism, agriculture and forestry industries that provide a living for the regions of Quebec. EOS BOS One might think that the Conservatives have forgotten that winter comes back every year in Quebec. EOS BOS Is the government going to respond to the outcry over these harmful measures for the workers and the regions and will it retreat and drop this reform? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, clearly the hon. EOS BOS member does not understand the changes we are proposing. EOS BOS These changes will help people who have lost their jobs to find new jobs. EOS BOS Such jobs will be in their local area and will correspond to their qualifications. EOS BOS We want to help these people because it is in the best interest of their families and our country to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, both the old-line parties have tax gifts for the wealthy instead of creating affordable child care spaces. EOS BOS While our trade deficit is soaring, imports of industrial machinery actually fell. EOS BOS That is a bad sign for a manufacturing sector that suffered from Conservatives' neglect. EOS BOS We have lost more than 400,000 jobs under their watch alone. EOS BOS Fewer good manufacturing jobs means more families are struggling to pay the bills as costs like child care continue to rise. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives scrap handouts to the wealthy and instead invest in boosting job creation and creating affordable child care spaces? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the subject of manufacturing, in this year's budget we put forth accelerated capital cost allowance, which has been called for by the manufacturing sector for a long time. EOS BOS While New Democrats may not like our policies when it comes to manufacturing, here is who is endorsing our budget: the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the Railway Association of Canada, the Canadian Steel Producers Association, the Agricultural Manufacturers of Canada, the Canadian Plastics Industry Association, and the Canadian Tooling and Machining Association. EOS BOS I could go on, but those who know what it takes to build manufacturing in Canada support our government and support our budget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, almost a decade after the Conservatives took power, Internet access in parts of rural ridings like mine still needs to be improved. EOS BOS The government is only now introducing a new satellite fee structure. EOS BOS In a country where telecom companies make huge profits and Canadians pay some of the highest fees in the developed world, I am told by satellite companies that northern Ontario is not a priority. EOS BOS What is the government going to do to ensure that rural Canadians, like my constituents in Thunder Bay—Rainy River, get access to affordable high-speed Internet now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that is a good question and I respect the member's sincerity on the matter, but of course we have taken action as a government. EOS BOS I just mentioned the satellite fee structure that we put in place. EOS BOS Beyond that, we have our connecting Canadians program. EOS BOS We have done an RFP, and we have had a return from all of Canada. EOS BOS Our goal was to have 280,000 households connected, which would take us to over 99% of all households connected in Canada, and we have exceeded that with over 300,000 households. EOS BOS We are going to be making announcements next week, starting in Kenora. EOS BOS Then we are going to go to the Columbia River valley. EOS BOS We are going to go all across this country. EOS BOS We are going to make sure that all Canadians are connected to high-speed Internet all across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a deep inequality among Canadians when it comes to high-speed Internet access. EOS BOS For many people outside of major centres, access to high-speed service quite simply does not exist or is unaffordable. EOS BOS The minister announced a reduction in the cost of operator licences, but nothing guarantees that this will give Canadians, particularly those in rural areas, real access to better service at a lower cost. EOS BOS Once again, wishful thinking is at play here. EOS BOS When will the minister take the needs of people in businesses in rural regions seriously? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have already taken peoples' needs seriously. EOS BOS That is why we proposed providing the amount required to enhance the power of wireless and high-speed services in every region of Canada. EOS BOS We will make announcements next week in each region, including Quebec. EOS BOS All Canadians will have access to good quality high-speed Internet. EOS BOS We need to involve all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' policies are driving down Canadians' salaries. EOS BOS Since the employment insurance reform was implemented, unemployed Canadians have had to accept lower salaries and jobs outside their field. EOS BOS The minister's reform is going to harm workers, families and regional economies. EOS BOS Does the minister understand that it will be impossible to replace specialized workers in seasonal sectors who are forced to leave their jobs and take a 30% pay cut? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what the member opposite has said is completely false. EOS BOS We are focused on ensuring that Canadians have opportunities for jobs in their local areas that match their skills. EOS BOS What would be better than having a job close to home where an individual could support his or her family?What the opposition member said is completely false, so let us be clear. EOS BOS We want to ensure that Canadians are better connected to jobs. EOS BOS That is why the government's plan has created 920,000 net new jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's talking points clearly do not fit the reality that Canadians are facing. EOS BOS There are five unemployed Canadians for every vacant job. EOS BOS It is even worse in the regions that have most to lose from the government's heartless changes. EOS BOS The minister does not seem to care. EOS BOS If one cannot find a job, one loses one's EI. EOS BOS Will the minister at least admit that this is the exact opposite of what the system is meant to do for workers who have paid for this insurance? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if the hon. member EOS BOS opposite heard what I just said. EOS BOS This government has created 920,000 net new jobs for Canadians. EOS BOS The changes we are making to employment insurance are to better connect Canadians with the jobs that are available in their local areas, to match their local skills. EOS BOS For those who are, unfortunately, unable to find employment, employment insurance will continue to be there for them, as it always has been. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, a group informed the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development that a delegation of representatives wants to meet with her on February 27 in order to discuss the impact that the employment insurance reform is having on eastern Quebec. EOS BOS Did the minister read that letter and will she meet with the representatives or not? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate that this government is focused on job creation and economic growth. EOS BOS We have created 920,000 net new jobs under our economic action plan. EOS BOS The changes that are being made to employment insurance are to clarify, not change, the responsibilities Canadians have with respect to EI. EOS BOS Employment insurance will continue to be there for them, when they require it, if they are temporarily unemployed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are not surprised that the minister does not want to meet with people. EOS BOS She does not even think she implemented a reform. EOS BOS The Conservatives are being unfair to seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada and Quebec. EOS BOS Even the deputy premier of New Brunswick, who is a Conservative, said that the termination of the pilot project is going to be bad for the province. EOS BOS Benefits are running out, the spring gap is coming and our economy is going to suffer. EOS BOS Will the minister change her mind before it is too late or will she force our workers to seek social assistance? EOS BOS Is this government not ashamed of stealing money from workers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is creating common sense changes to employment insurance to make sure we are better connecting Canadians with available jobs. EOS BOS In my local riding of Simcoe—Grey, with its many seasonal workers, that is exactly what these changes are going to do. EOS BOS They are clarifying for my constituents exactly what they need to do to make sure they have access to employment insurance if they require it. EOS BOS Whether it is the new enhanced jobs alert program or whether it is the enhancement to the youth employment strategy of $50 million in last year's budget, these are the things we are doing to create new jobs. EOS BOS In fact, we have created 920,000 net new jobs over the course of the economic action plan. EOS
BOS I am sure the official record will show the sentiment that was just expressed, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS (1425)[Translation]This spring has been extraordinary and unprecedented in the Arab world. EOS BOS The shift towards democracy is not an easy one. EOS BOS The people of those countries need support. EOS BOS Last month, the G8 promised $20 billion, but there is nothing from Canada. EOS BOS The Conservatives do not seem to understand the importance of committing to helping these people make the transition. EOS BOS Why has Canada isolated itself from its G8 allies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, at the outset of my time in the House, let me thank the electors of Ottawa West— EOS BOS Nepean and congratulate my friend, the new Leader of the Opposition, on an impressive result at election time. EOS BOS Let me tell him that our government and I are committed to working with him on this and other important issues. EOS BOS I can correct the correct the record and tell the Leader of the Opposition that over the past few years, we have put more than a quarter of a billion dollars of new funding to support efforts that will be of direct benefit to the people of Egypt and Tunisia. EOS BOS Obviously, we are making an unprecedented commitment in Libya, and I look forward to working with the Leader of the Opposition and his team on this important issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a working group in the Department of Natural Resources of Canada has concluded that the federal government should regulate the shale gas industry better. EOS BOS I repeat: this is a federal government working group, so I do not want to hear the excuse that this is under provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS The group says, among other things, that the public is not well informed and the regulations are based on old practices that do not take into account the consequences for the water table. EOS BOS Are the Conservatives finally going to listen to that recommendation, or will they continue to ignore the concerns expressed by Canadians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the shale gas exploration development has been going on in the west for many decades. EOS BOS This is a provincial matter, under provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS It is being investigated from a regulatory perspective in a number of provinces, and we await the results. EOS BOS In the meantime, there is no indication of any leakage or any harm to water in the areas in which it is being developed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a leaked Parks Canada memo alerted British Columbians that thousands of plastic feed bags escaped from an aquaculture farm and washed ashore in the Broken Group Islands, yet for some reason the Tseshaht First Nation and other local groups were never notified. EOS BOS We only know about the spill due to the memo, riddled with talking points and concerns about negative press but containing no plan. EOS BOS Clearly, the government cares a thousand times more about its image than protecting the environment. EOS BOS Will the Liberals apologize to Vancouver Islanders and finally act to create a permanent, dedicated, and annual fund to help with marine debris cleanups? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member opposite that we care greatly about the environment, that we are concerned about this incident, that Parks Canada is involved with the cleanup, and that we will continue to work very hard to ensure that we protect our oceans. EOS BOS As members know, we have our oceans protection plan. EOS BOS We are absolutely committed to protecting our oceans and protecting the environment. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Prairie farmers and farm families are waiting for the Liberals to extend the grain freight provisions, including inter-switching, that have helped them get their grain to market. EOS BOS The minister could have made this decision last year, but will spend the rest of the year consulting, unnecessarily, By the time he is done dithering, these provisions will have ended, leaving producers without reliable access to market. EOS BOS Why is the minister deliberately delaying this extension? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are looking at this matter very seriously. EOS BOS It comes at a time when the Canada Transportation Act review has been submitted, something which I tabled in the House on February 25, a very serious document with a large number of recommendations, some of which touch upon grain transportation. EOS BOS I can assure my colleague that we are looking at this matter very seriously. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if the Liberals were serious about doing anything on this, the Liberal MPs yesterday would not have refused to agree to hear from prairie grain farmers who were concerned about these provisions not having yet been extended. EOS BOS In fact, I then took the opportunity this morning to meet with these farmers. EOS BOS They said that while the Liberals refused to listen to them, they know that this side of the House would stand up for them. EOS BOS Will the minister extend these provisions that the farm families desperately need? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but my hon. EOS BOS colleague is blowing smoke here. EOS BOS We have met with a number of groups ever since I put out that report. EOS BOS As I said, I put it out on February 25, because I wanted to hear back from western grain farmers, from the shippers, and from the railroads. EOS BOS I wanted to hear from everybody. EOS BOS Believe me, my schedule shows that I am meeting a whole bunch of them. EOS BOS I encourage my hon. EOS BOS colleague to relax. EOS BOS I am doing my work. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, chicken farmers have not been reassured by answers from the Minister of Agriculture  about the unprecedented imports of spent hens from the United States. EOS BOS My question then is for the Minister of Public Safety. EOS BOS Why did the CBSA, under the duty relief program, allow 213 million pounds of spent fowl into Canada last year, jeopardizing supply management for chickens and creating worries about fresh poultry from consumers? EOS BOS Will the Minister of Public Safety remove spent fowl from that duty relief list immediately? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it very interesting that the member for Malpeque pulled himself from agricultural files several years ago because the agricultural industries out there did not recognize his brilliance. EOS BOS That continues today. EOS BOS The question he asked is well in hand. EOS BOS I continue to work with my colleagues at CBSA and finance to find resolution on this file. EOS BOS Chicken farmers are well served by our government. EOS BOS They continue to tell us this, even when they were lobbying here last week. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, president-elect Trump would love a carbon tax for Canada. EOS BOS Why would he not? EOS BOS Higher energy costs in this country would mean more factories and jobs would move to his country. EOS BOS We have already lost 58,000 good blue collar jobs in Canada since the current Prime Minister came to office a year ago, mostly because of high electricity prices. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals making matters worse by taxing away good blue collar jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister has stated, Canada has no closer friend, partner, or ally than the United States, and we look forward to working closely with president-elect Trump, his administration, and the United States Congress over the coming years. EOS BOS On climate, Canada has ratified the Paris agreement and is committed to its implementation. EOS BOS We will continue to move forward with the international community on climate change and clean growth and with the provinces and territories to develop a pan-Canadian strategy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal carbon tax would create well-paying, blue collar, American jobs. EOS BOS U.S. competitors would have a huge advantage. EOS BOS Here at home, there are 58,000 fewer people employed in goods-producing sectors. EOS BOS These are miners; they are loggers; they are rig workers; they are factory workers. EOS BOS This new carbon tax would mean even more of them would lose their jobs to competitors south of the border. EOS BOS Why is the government so determined to send Canadian jobs south? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians know that putting a price on carbon pollution would improve our response to economic challenges, would create good middle-class jobs here in Canada going forward, and would demonstrate the kind of leadership the entire world is looking for on climate action. EOS BOS We are taking real action on climate change because, as Canadians understand, a strong economy and environmental sustainability go hand in hand. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, 86% of oil refined in eastern Canada comes from other countries. EOS BOS The majority of foreign oil producers, like Algeria and Venezuela, do not prioritize environmental stewardship, in which Canada is already a world leader. EOS BOS However, the Liberals changed the rules and added roadblocks for Canadian energy, risking investment and jobs. EOS BOS Of course, the Liberals' rules do not apply to foreign oil tankers in the St. Lawrence. EOS BOS That is a double standard. EOS BOS My question is clear. EOS BOS Will the Liberals add upstream and downstream emissions assessment as a condition for foreign oil imports? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the interim principles that we established in 2016 apply to the energy east project—the very same assessment. EOS BOS By the way, the assessment of the projects that have already been approved resulted in 3,000 jobs for the Nova Gas pipeline, 7,000 jobs for the Line 3 replacement project, 15,440 jobs for the Trans Mountain expansion project—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS We need to hear. EOS BOS The Minister of Natural Resources has about 10 more seconds. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Natural Resources. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if the hon. EOS BOS member and the House want to know about more jobs created in the energy sector, I would invite the question. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of talk and no answers. EOS BOS A 2014 WorleyParsons study, before the Liberals created complete chaos, said that Alberta's regulatory standards are the best in the world. EOS BOS The Liberals are deliberately stopping Canada's highly regulated, socially and environmentally responsible oil from getting to market with roadblocks and delays, but not oil from regimes with dismal human rights and environmental records. EOS BOS Liberal uncertainty actually puts world-class Canadian energy second. EOS BOS When will the Liberals finally champion Canadian resources and stop putting Canadian oil and gas workers out of jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are deliberately creating good jobs in the energy sector throughout the country, and mostly in Alberta. EOS BOS I could go on. EOS BOS There is the Arnaud apatite mine, with 910 jobs, and the Woodfibre LNG, with 700 jobs. EOS BOS We have created thousands of jobs in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and across the country in the energy sector because we know natural resources drive the Canadian economy, and they will continue to do so under this government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, construction of the energy east pipeline is vital for creating thousands of jobs in Quebec and New Brunswick. EOS BOS Studies show that it could generate billions of dollars in economic benefits. EOS BOS The Liberals were never going to support this important project for eastern Canada. EOS BOS They prefer to make ideological decisions instead of sharing Canada's natural resources from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS Why does this Prime Minister, who claims to defend the middle class, refuse to stand up to create good jobs here in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have been saying since this government was elected that it is a primary ambition of the Government of Canada to move our resources to markets sustainably and that environmental stewardship and economic growth go hand in hand, and the third pillar is meaningful consultation with indigenous communities.
              We have changed the process. EOS BOS We have made sure that all three pillars have been essential in the way we have made decisions, and in so doing we have created tens of thousands of jobs for Albertans and Canadians in less than two years. EOS BOS We think that is not a bad record. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, mutual insurance companies are worried about the Conservatives' proposed new regulations, which would create two classes of policy holders. EOS BOS Why is the government refusing to require that all policy holders be treated equally and that capital be invested in the community? EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives bringing in regulations that would jeopardize the future of mutual insurance companies by introducing incentives that could lead to demutualization? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know that the mutual insurance industry has made its concerns about this issue very clear to the government. EOS BOS Of course, the primary questions here are of a provincial nature. EOS BOS However, we are in dialogue with the industry, and I know that the Minister of Finance is following this very closely. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, several concerns have been raised about the Conservatives' express entry program. EOS BOS This time, the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada is sounding the alarm and suggesting that the program cannot identify registered francophone immigrants. EOS BOS There are more than 22,000 people in the recruitment pool, but apparently only 200 are francophone. EOS BOS This represents barely 2%, while the target for francophone immigrants is 4%.How will the minister ensure that his own targets for francophone immigration will be reached with this program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is proud to be the only government in the history of Canada to have attracted more than 2,500 francophone immigrants to the provinces and territories outside Quebec every year since 2006.The new express entry program will allow us to identify many more francophone immigrants and to ensure that they settle in all regions faster than ever. EOS BOS We have provided funding for francophone communities and francophone immigration networks in the roadmap. EOS BOS We are taking action to enhance the francophone presence throughout Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is more bad news for francophone communities outside Quebec. EOS BOS The president of the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada has criticized the lack of measures to increase francophone immigration. EOS BOS The last time she appeared before the Standing Committee on Official Languages, Ms. Kenny even described the situation of francophone immigration outside Quebec as scandalous. EOS BOS She is asking the federal government to take drastic measures right away to avert disaster for the communities. EOS BOS Will the government listen? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the scandal is the NDP's failure to recognize the progress that has been made in this area. EOS BOS This Conservative government is the only one in Canadian history to have brought over 2,500 francophone immigrants to our country. EOS BOS We do not even know how many francophones immigrate to Canada through Quebec's programs and how many of them settle in other provinces. EOS BOS We have strengthened the capacity of all of the francophone immigration networks to receive francophones in record time in every province and territory of Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the role of the government is to guarantee fair treatment for everyone who lives in Canada. EOS BOS However, this Conservative government does not think that refugees are worthy of being treated humanely. EOS BOS That is shameful. EOS BOS The Federal Court ruled that refugees, and in particular children, were being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment by being denied access to health care. EOS BOS True to form, the Conservative government is appealing this decision to try to save some money at refugees' expense. EOS BOS Will the government finally act humanely and withdraw its appeal of that decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should be ashamed of suggesting that a single refugee in Canada is not benefiting from generous health care programs, because that is the truth. EOS BOS We believe that the Federal Court ruling was flawed, which is why we will appeal it. EOS BOS We announced our intention to do so, and in the meantime we will continue to protect refugees and Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, because of the Conservatives, refugees no longer have access to health care. EOS BOS That is an inhumane decision that has an impact on the health of the least fortunate. EOS BOS What will happen to pregnant women, sick children and seniors who cannot pay for the care they need? EOS BOS Why does the government not admit its mistake? EOS BOS Why does it not withdraw its appeal of the decision? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, the hon. EOS BOS member is misleading the House. EOS BOS There is not a single refugee in Canada who does not benefit from generous health care programs. EOS BOS Even the Federal Court ruling did not say that there were no refugees receiving health care. EOS BOS This is about other categories of asylum seekers. EOS BOS We will appeal the decision, and we will continue to protect the interests of refugees and Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, he should actually talk to some refugees, like people on this side of the House do. EOS BOS It fell to the Federal Court to defend Canadian values, and the court found the Conservatives' policy with respect to refugees “cruel and unusual”. EOS BOS Instead of respecting our shared values and instead of showing compassion for refugees, the government is appealing the decision. EOS BOS It is unbelievable. EOS BOS The result of the government's intransigence is that desperate parents will put off help for their kids until they are very sick. EOS BOS Pregnant women will go without prenatal care. EOS BOS Why will the government not show some humanity and drop the appeal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member should know better. EOS BOS Refugees in this country continue to benefit from very generous health care programs. EOS BOS This was a flawed decision. EOS BOS We are appealing it. EOS BOS We are standing up for refugees. EOS BOS We are standing up for taxpayers. EOS BOS One way that all members of the House could stand up for refugees in Iraq and elsewhere is agreeing to do more to face down the menace of ISIL. EOS BOS Why does the NDP refuse to consider the revocation of passports and the revocation of citizenship for those who take up arms against refugees and kill innocent minorities in cold blood? EOS BOS Why does it exclude all military options to help to protect— EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Parkdale—High Park. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, back to the topic at hand, we already know that the consequence of their appeal will be more kids being hospitalized for serious illnesses. EOS BOS The Federal Court said that the impact of the government's policy on vulnerable and innocent children “ EOS BOS shocks the conscience and outrages [Canadian] standards of decency”.Yet, the Conservatives have the gall to stand there and say it is about saving money. EOS BOS No Canadian parent thinks that saving money by making children suffer is a good thing. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives instead do the right thing and withdraw their appeal? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this is a flawed decision. EOS BOS We are going to appeal it. EOS BOS I am not going to comment in any detail any further on matters that are before a court. EOS BOS However, what I will comment on is that Canada has opened its doors to 18,500 Iraqi refugees since 2009. EOS BOS They are benefiting from health care. EOS BOS They are benefiting from Canada's generosity. EOS BOS They come from areas where people want the international community to act with humanitarian action, with military action to end the menace ISIL, which has created one of the biggest displacements of humanity and humanitarian crises in our lifetime. EOS BOS Why does the NDP refuse to do anything to help millions of people in Iraq— EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Sault Ste. EOS BOS Marie. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, earlier this week the Parliamentary Budget Officer confirmed that our family tax cut and universal child care benefit would put more money into the pockets of every Canadian family with children. EOS BOS The PBO also confirmed that these benefits are progressive, helping the lowest-income families the most. EOS BOS Can the Minister of State for Social Development  please inform the House about why the government believes that all families deserve support? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver South for the great work and the very good question. EOS BOS The PBO did report definitely that our benefits would help lower- to middle-income families the most, which is what we have been saying. EOS BOS He also confirmed that every Canadian family with children would benefit. EOS BOS We recognize that there are no two families that are alike in Canada when it comes to their needs and the decisions they make regarding child care. EOS BOS We will continue to support all Canadian families. EOS BOS While the NDP plan would leave out 90% of Canadian families, we will support all Canadian families with real assistance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, over 118 countries have signed the arms trade treaty, including every single NATO country except Canada. EOS BOS After much delay, the minister is now claiming that Canada's controls exceed those of the proposed ATT. EOS BOS Therefore, why not sign the ATT? EOS BOS In fact, this will stop the illicit trade of arms, which are now a problem in South Sudan, in CAR and in places like Nigeria. EOS BOS When will the minister sign this deal? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has some of the strongest export controls in the world, including those through the Export and Import Permits Act and the automatic firearms country control list. EOS BOS What we are deeply concerned about is the establishment of another long gun registry and the billions of dollars that could be wasted. EOS BOS I know that is a great disappointment to my friend opposite. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is nonsense. EOS BOS This week, the Government of Nigeria and the International Committee of the Red Cross pleaded for the ratification of the arms trade treaty. EOS BOS This would help us keep illegal weapons out of the hands of terrorist groups like Boko Haram, which is responsible for kidnapping 200 girls in Nigeria. EOS BOS Will the minister listen to the Government of Nigeria and sign the treaty to save lives? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of any Canadian arms that have gone to Boko Haram or any of the examples she has cited, so I am not sure how those problems would have been stopped. EOS BOS What we do have is strong domestic legislation that controls Canadian arms from finding their way into the hands of the very organizations and governments that she just suggested. EOS BOS She talks about the government of Nigeria. EOS BOS Obviously we have some concerns in many respects of that government in terms of exporting arms, given its abysmal human rights record. EOS
BOS There have been consultations among the parties. EOS BOS Therefore, before the hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs rises to make a statement, I would invite all hon. EOS BOS members to rise for two minutes of silence to commemorate our veterans.[A moment of silence observed] EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by first recognizing the important anniversary we are observing this year. EOS BOS On July 27, 1953, a ceasefire was finally brokered on the Korean Peninsula. EOS BOS With the beginnings of the Korean War armistice, two bitter foes agreed to put down their weapons. EOS BOS Sixty years later, we still remember the more than 26,000 Canadians who served courageously on land, at sea, and in the skies during some of the most brutal and bloodiest fighting of the Korean War. EOS BOS Approximately 7,000 Canadians continued to serve there after the fragile ceasefire was reached and, as we sadly remember, 516 brave Canadians made the ultimate sacrifice so the world might one day know peace. EOS BOS Despite all of this, the Korean War has long been viewed by many as the forgotten war, and that is why our government sought to correct this wrong by making this year, 2013, the Year of the Korean War Veteran. EOS BOS We all respect the official record of this place. EOS BOS Every word we speak in the House is captured indefinitely by Hansard, and this is why at the end of my speech I will table, in both official languages, a list of every Canadian who perished in the Korean War. EOS BOS I do so with the hope that all Canadians will know the names of those who made the ultimate sacrifice, that their names will be enshrined in Hansard for future generations to come. EOS BOS It is truly an honour to rise this afternoon to deliver my first Veterans' Week statement as Canada's new Minister of Veterans Affairs. EOS BOS At the outset, I want to thank the Prime Minister for the privilege of serving Canada's veterans and their families, serving those who have served our country so bravely and so well. EOS BOS Our men and women in uniform have an incredible sense of duty and commitment to service above self. EOS BOS We recognize the toll their service takes on their families, the extra responsibilities and duties their loved ones assume on the home front each day, the constant fear that comes with not knowing how loved ones are doing or even where they are. EOS BOS This reality is unique to our military families and as I salute them for their contributions, I ask all Canadians to do likewise. EOS BOS It is these realities that have motivated me to stand in the chamber today to thank all of our military families for sharing their loved ones with us. EOS BOS We truly are a grateful nation and we remember fondly the devotion and sacrifice of the men and women who have chosen to demonstrate their love of country by wearing the maple leaf. 
							I have been privileged to travel far and wide to meet with some of our veterans and see the respect and gratitude they have earned around the world. EOS BOS Even more profoundly brought home to me time and again is the sense of altruistic patriotism shown by the veterans themselves, proud, honourable and distinguished Canadians, past, present and, no doubt, future, truly the best Canada has to offer. EOS BOS I cannot say how proud I felt to be a Canadian when I accompanied our Korean War veterans on their return visit to the Korean Peninsula in July. EOS BOS Let me also assure everyone that South Korea is a nation that continues to honour and remember the great sacrifices of the Canadian men and women who protected their freedom some 60 years ago. EOS BOS I felt equally privileged to be with Canadian veterans and Canadian Armed Forces personnel in Sicily to mark the 70th anniversary of Operation Husky and the Italian campaign that liberated my native Italy from the tyranny and oppression of the day. EOS BOS Just as important, I have been meeting veterans and their families here at home, in their communities, from coast to coast, in places like Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, London and Sarnia, in Fredericton, Halifax, Charlottetown and Vancouver. EOS BOS These men and women, as well as their strong and supportive families, represent the very best of what it means to be Canadian. EOS BOS (1510)It is tempting to say that we are fortunate people, or to believe that fate has looked kindly upon us, but Canada did not become a great nation by accident. EOS BOS This prosperous and democratic country that we love, this way of life we hold so dear, is owed in large measure to the generations of men and women who have courageously stood up and put themselves at risk to defend our shared ideals and values. EOS BOS They have stood up for Canada, for our core beliefs of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. EOS BOS They have stood up for a caring and conscientious peace-loving people, and that is why we are here today. EOS BOS We appreciate that Canada is a precious gift, made by many who have served and continue to serve at home and abroad: on land, at sea and in the air. EOS BOS We are their heirs to peace, security and quality of life that we can never take for granted. EOS BOS We never will. EOS BOS This Veterans' Week, we come together as a proud nation to honour the more than two million Canadians who have worn our nation's uniform during times of peace and war, and to remember the 118,000 brave men and women who have paid for our freedom with their lives. EOS BOS Whether these are profound memories and personal reflections of sacrifices, or in any way those we can tribute today, be they in Europe or elsewhere where our soldiers are buried, at the cenotaphs or services of remembrance, Canadians will never forget. EOS BOS One such profound recent reminder was at the Royal Canadian Legion General Wingate Branch, No. EOS BOS 256, in Toronto. While honouring the sacrifice of Canadian Jewish World War I heroes, Mr. Murray Jacobs, past president, captured the significance of the day when he said something that was reflective of the weather, the temperature, and the inclement conditions we were under there. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS We are reminded that the rain is really teardrops as we remember our fallen brethren”.That is our history, our proud military heritage, which predates our nation itself. EOS BOS This is who we are. EOS BOS It is a history that our government is proud to honour, revere and commemorate. EOS BOS Next year, we will be commemorating the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of the Second World War, as part of our plans leading to the celebration of Canada's 150th birthday in 2017. EOS BOS We are determined to ensure future generations of Canadians never forget the people and events that shaped our nation, that they never forget the terrible loss of life or the scale of the devastation, destruction, sacrifice and trauma that the tragedy of war brings. EOS BOS It is indeed regrettable that after all these years we still cannot claim world peace in our time. EOS BOS A new generation of Canadian men and women have instead known the horrors of modern-day war, and fighting during the Afghanistan and Libya campaigns. EOS BOS Canadians are still serving in the cause of peace and freedom, from Cyprus to the Golan Heights, to the Sudan and the Congo. EOS BOS They are continuing to serve in the proud traditions of those who came before them, defending Canada with honour, courage and distinction. EOS BOS As we return to our communities, and as we await with great anticipation for the return of the final group of personnel from Afghanistan, and as we prepare to gather at local cenotaphs and memorials, I ask all Canadians to make this Veterans' Week a time of reflection and gratitude. EOS BOS Let us make it a time to remember those to whom we owe so much, those who sacrificed, those who have given us what we can never fully repay, those upon whose shoulders this and future generations of Canadians stand. EOS BOS Lest we forget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs and the government for their kind remarks on Veterans' Week. EOS BOS I would like to highlight the names of some veterans and their families throughout this country who have given so much. EOS BOS They are not only Canada's heroes, but some are my personal friends. EOS BOS There is Major Dan Gagnon, who served so bravely in Rwanda, and Major Tom Wilson, who retired after 36 years of valiant service. EOS BOS Between the two of them, they have 72 years of proud military tradition in the Canadian military. EOS BOS Lily Snow, Helen Rapp, Louise Richard and Nichola Goddard, Nichola having paid the ultimate sacrifice, are brave women who served side by side with the men who served so bravely in all the wars and conflicts that Canada has entered into. EOS BOS There is Murray Brown of the RCMP. EOS BOS We must not forget about our RCMP and their families, who serve so bravely, not only internationally but at home as well. EOS BOS There are great people, such as, Medric Cousineau and his campaign for service dogs, Michael Blais with the Canadian Veterans Advocacy, and veterans advocate Sean Bruyea. EOS BOS Also worth noting are the Royal Canadian Legion and many organizations that advocate, not only for remembrance of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, but for those who are still with us. EOS BOS I would also mention Mr. Peter Lahey of the International Transport Workers' Federation, who is going to Liverpool on November 10 to lay a wreath on behalf of all seafarers and merchant mariners throughout the world. EOS BOS I congratulate Mr. Nathan Greenfield, an author who wrote a fantastic book called The Forgotten. EOS BOS He has written about prisoners of war and those who escaped various conflicts when they were in prison in World War I and World War II. EOS BOS However, there is one person who stands out. EOS BOS That is Mr. Ed Carter-Edwards, of Smithville, Ontario. EOS BOS He is now 95 years old. EOS BOS I swear, if Canada were at war tomorrow, he would be the first one to sign up. EOS BOS He was in the bomber command that was shot down over Europe. EOS BOS He and his colleagues were in the Buchenwald concentration camp, which went against the Geneva Convention. EOS BOS Somehow he ended up surviving to tell us the story of what happened. EOS BOS Recently, in a book signing at the Armoury in Ottawa, he told a bunch of new officers of the Canadian military about the tremendous experiences of what he went through. EOS BOS When doing so, one could have heard a pin drop. EOS BOS This is one of Canada's true national heroes. EOS BOS He is about five feet tall, but as tough as they get. EOS BOS I personally want to salute Mr. Ed Carter-Edwards, on behalf of all of us in the House of Commons, and all Canadians, for his tremendous fighting spirit and efforts in reminding us of the price of war. EOS BOS I also want to congratulate the Government of Canada for making this the year of the Korean veteran. EOS BOS We would like to say to all of those who served in Korea, and their families, that the Korean War is forgotten no more. EOS BOS I am very proud that the minister presented the 516 names into Hansard today, so that all Canadians will be able to look upon them as true Canadian heroes, as well as those who have served and sacrificed, were injured, and eventually came home. EOS BOS We truly will not be able to have peace in Korea until North Korea and South Korea become a unified country. EOS BOS I hope that all of us will be alive when that gracious day comes. EOS BOS On behalf of the leader of the New Democratic Party and all of my colleagues from coast to coast to coast, we say to each and every veteran who has served, their families, and those who will serve and become veterans in the future, that there is a gravesite in Brussels from World War I. When the individual passed away, the family put something on the gravesite. EOS BOS It states, “ EOS BOS This Canadian left his home so that you can live in yours”. EOS BOS I am a Dutch-born Canadian. I know that the minister is from Italy. EOS BOS We know all too well about the liberation that was made possible by what Canadians did so that our families and our countries could be free. EOS BOS On behalf of all of us, we say God bless to our veterans and their families. EOS BOS May God have mercy on the souls of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am truly humbled to speak on behalf of my leader and the Liberal Party of Canada as we honour the men and women who have answered the call to serve their country. EOS BOS A lot of them are here today and we need to recognize them, and a lot of them are now missed as members of Parliament. EOS BOS Throughout our history, young Canadians have enlisted to fight for freedom in faraway lands. EOS BOS They have answered the call to serve in two world wars, and the Korean War, as peacekeepers and as peacemakers. EOS BOS They have left home, their mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, their sweethearts and their wives and children. EOS BOS They have gone to fight for freedom and justice. EOS BOS They have gone to fight for those who are oppressed and persecuted. EOS BOS They have gone to keep warring sides apart and to maintain shaky peace treaties. EOS BOS They have gone to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. EOS BOS I cannot imagine facing what each of them has faced. EOS BOS I cannot imagine the rush of adrenalin as they face the enemy or come under fire. EOS BOS I cannot imagine seeing their comrades being killed or wounded, and I cannot imagine the horrors they have witnessed. EOS BOS In 1914, young Canadians from across the country enlisted to fight in Europe. EOS BOS By the end of the First World War, 619,636 had gone to war. EOS BOS George Herald Baker, a member of this House of Commons, was one of the 66,000 who did not come home. EOS BOS Through the blood of our soldiers, Canada won its place at the treaty table. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the war to end all wars did not end all wars. EOS BOS Once again, between 1939 and 1945, 1.1 million young Canadians went off to war, and 45,400 did not make it home. EOS BOS There were 54,000 Canadians who came home with physical wounds, and countless others came home with psychological wounds. EOS BOS Between 1950 and 1953, 26,791 Canadians served in the Canadian Army Special Force, in Korea. EOS BOS There were 1,516 young Canadians who did not come home and 1,042 were wounded. EOS BOS Since the Korean War, more than 1,800 Canadians have fallen in the line of duty. EOS BOS They were serving on peacekeeping missions and other foreign military operations, on domestic operations and training. EOS BOS The 158 Canadians who have fallen in Afghanistan are included in this number. EOS BOS Others have returned home with physical and mental wounds. EOS BOS These men and women exemplify the best of what it means to be a Canadian: strong, caring and compassionate, with a sense of justice and a willingness to defend and protect the weak and the helpless. EOS BOS In 2005, I had the privilege of visiting two DART camps, one in Sri Lanka, after the tsunami, and one in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. EOS BOS In Pakistan, I watched as a young Canadian doctor spoke to an injured child in his own language. EOS BOS I heard about doctors and medics who put on their boots, strapped their medical supplies to their backs, climbed the mountains, and delivered medical care to those who were too injured to make it to the DART hospital. EOS BOS In 2006, I had the opportunity to go to Vimy Ridge and saw the soaring monument to the 3,598 Canadians who lost their lives during that four-day bloody battle. EOS BOS I saw the landscapes that still bear the scars of the exploding shells. EOS BOS I saw the trenches where our soldiers lived and died. EOS BOS At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month each year, we remember those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. EOS BOS However, every day of the rest of the year, every time we see a veteran or a member of the Canadian Armed Forces, we should stop and take a moment to shake their hands and say, “ EOS BOS Thank you for your service. EOS BOS We are in your debt”. EOS BOS Lest we forget. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Remembrance Day is an opportunity for each of us to realize that we owe a debt to veterans and their families. EOS BOS We have a duty to teach future generations about those who put what was best for their country ahead of what was best for them. EOS BOS We all have to appreciate that, without the sacrifice of our veterans in the two great wars, our democratic way of life would not be what it is today. EOS BOS In the same breath, we must recognize the extraordinary courage of today's troops, some of whom have sacrificed their physical or mental health to defend our values. EOS BOS On this Remembrance Day, we have a collective duty to honour the soldiers and their families. EOS BOS We must ensure that their legacy lives on. EOS BOS We have been commemorating this day to preserve the memory of our veterans and demonstrate solidarity with them and their families for nearly 100 years. EOS BOS Canada's commemorative symbol is the red poppy and France's is the blue cornflower or bleuet de France. EOS BOS Red and blue were the colours of the trenches in those days. EOS BOS Remembrance Day has a special meaning to the people in my region. EOS BOS Together we remember the heartbreak of watching soldiers departing and the emotional homecomings. EOS BOS Every day, I run into men and women who have a direct or indirect connection with the military base in my region, CFB Bagotville, who have ties with the soldiers who go overseas but remain close to their hearts. EOS BOS Every day I see the joy on the faces of children and their family members. EOS BOS Sometimes I reflect on the sacrifice of soldiers and their families, their courage and bravery. EOS BOS I thank our Canadian soldiers. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to join the other parties in paying tribute to the Canadian citizens who make sacrifices overseas. EOS BOS [English]I want to start by reminding us that when we wear these poppies, we are financially supporting the work of the Royal Canadian Legion. EOS BOS I want to publicly thank the Royal Canadian Legion for the amazing work they are doing. EOS BOS They are providing much-needed assistance to our veterans in post-traumatic stress disorder assistance, they are providing housing, and they are stretching themselves to meet needs. EOS BOS I am deeply indebted to them for their work. EOS BOS I encourage people to remember to wear the poppy, and when one falls off to be sure to put more money in the box before they pick up their next one. EOS BOS This is important work they are doing. EOS BOS (1530)[Translation]The Green Party and I are very aware of the huge sacrifice that soldiers must make to defend our Canadian values. EOS BOS [English]We have seen many generations go to war. EOS BOS We can think of their sacrifices, and on days like this—indeed, in weeks like this—we pay homage. EOS BOS However, we have, as non-combatants, the very real risk of trespassing the line between remembering and honouring the sacrifice of the fallen and glorifying war. EOS BOS We know that those who have served and those who have been in battle will be the last ones who would ever want us to do that. EOS BOS One of my closest friends is someone who fought and served in the Second World War. EOS BOS Despite an age difference, I can say that I feel I am one of his contemporaries, although he is 92. EOS BOS Farley Mowat served in the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, known as the Hasty Ps. EOS BOS In his book And No Birds Sang, he recounts in grim, evocative detail what it was like in the Sicily campaign. EOS BOS He speaks of that period and says: I came back from the war rejecting my species. EOS BOS I hated what had been done to me and what I had done and what man did to man. EOS BOS It is in that spirit that we should all recommit ourselves to find the way forward to peace, and in doing so, do it in the name of every son, brother, father, mother, sister, and child who has gone to war without coming back. EOS BOS We do it to say that we are committed to a path to peace, knowing that it is not an easy path and knowing that we do it to honour those who have sacrificed so much so that we have the liberty to try. EOS BOS [Translation]Peace remains a realistic dream, but we will have to work hard to achieve it. EOS BOS [English]Today, with all of us gathered on one of those days when we are truly joined in spirit and in purpose, we say, “ EOS BOS Never again. EOS BOS Lest we forget.” EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the tragedies in Newfoundland and Labrador as a result of inadequate search and rescue continue to mount. EOS BOS The latest victim is 14-year-old Burton Winters of Makkovik, Labrador. EOS BOS The defence department revealed Wednesday that its Goose Bay-based Griffon helicopters were out of service. EOS BOS Déjà vu. EOS BOS In 2009, when the Cougar helicopter went down off Newfoundland, the Gander-based Cormorants were in Nova Scotia and also unavailable. EOS BOS How many more tragedies must there be before search and rescue problems are finally addressed? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said a number of times, our thoughts and prayers are with the family of young Burton Winters, his friends and the entire community of Makkovik. EOS BOS Officials were in Newfoundland yesterday providing detailed analysis of the circumstances around this tragedy. EOS BOS A full investigation has now been completed. EOS BOS We have a much greater understanding of the timeline and the way that these tragic events unfolded. EOS BOS Both the RCMP and Canadian Forces officials have explained some of these circumstances. EOS BOS There are improvements that can be made perhaps in protocol and we are in a constant state of update and improvement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is cold comfort for Newfoundland and Labrador mariners. EOS BOS That is no comfort. EOS BOS It is one thing for National Defence to state it met its own standards. EOS BOS It is another to say the response to Makkovik was satisfactory and the equipment adequate. EOS BOS Yesterday's press conference raised more questions than it answered. EOS BOS First we learned weather delays prevented the rescue. EOS BOS Now we learn the helicopters in the region were out of commission. EOS BOS What is the real story? EOS BOS Will the government finally fix search and rescue? EOS BOS Will the government finally fix what is broken? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us keep a few facts in mind. EOS BOS Our country has the largest search and rescue territory on the planet. EOS BOS We have dedicated SAR techs who do their best each and every time. EOS BOS As officials said yesterday and the member has just repeated, the weather in Makkovik was a factor when the first call came in. EOS BOS It impacted on officials' decisions as to when to dispatch aircraft. EOS BOS As explained by Admiral Gardam yesterday, the weather was an issue. EOS BOS The first call came 20 hours after this young man had apparently left his home. EOS BOS A second call came some 51 hours later. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian families in my constituency of Saskatoon—Humboldt are pleased with the government delivering on results for 100% of Canadian families with children through our family tax cut and universal child care benefit. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Employment please give the House an update on how our plan is delivering for hard-working, middle-class Canadian families? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our family tax cut and benefits help 100% of families with kids. EOS BOS Family tax cuts through income splitting will put up to $2,000 in the pockets of couples. EOS BOS The universal child care benefit will grow to $2,000 per year for kids under age six, and $720 for kids ages six through seventeen. EOS BOS The Liberals have announced that they would raise taxes on families. EOS BOS They would replace the family tax cut with a Liberal family tax hike. EOS BOS They would roll back the tax-free savings accounts. EOS BOS Even after all that, they admit that they would have a $2 billion hole. EOS BOS We are lowering taxes for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a new study reveals that women now earn 72% of what men earn. EOS BOS That kind of discrimination is unacceptable and unfairly affects women. EOS BOS Thanks to the NDP, a parliamentary committee will propose an action plan to achieve pay equity. EOS BOS Will the government promise today to pass the proactive bill on pay equity so that equal work for equal pay, the slogan women have chanted for too long, can become a reality? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, having a gender wage gap in Canada in 2016 is unacceptable. EOS BOS As the first commitment toward pay equity, our Prime Minister appointed a gender-balanced cabinet. EOS BOS We are firmly committed to a public service that reflects the diversity in society, which includes gender parity, and we have supported the appointment of a special committee on pay equity. EOS BOS We will continue to lead by example and work with all members of the House and our provincial and territorial partners to close the gap. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not just about wages. EOS BOS Women are also far more likely to be engaged in precarious work. EOS BOS Two-thirds of all part-time workers and more than half of all temporary workers in Canada are women. EOS BOS This makes it harder for women to earn a stable income, to afford food and rent, and to qualify for programs like employment insurance. EOS BOS Why did the Liberals let Canadian women down by voting against lowering the threshold on EI? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely true that the gap is growing for women, and that more and more are not able to access the very services they deserve. EOS BOS That is why we committed during the election to review the EI system, modernize it, and bring it into today's world, which will serve all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, today is International Women's Day, a day when we celebrate women's achievements and their potential in Canada and globally. EOS BOS Speaking of achievements, we saw a record number of 88 women elected to the House in the last election. EOS BOS The Prime Minister appointed an equal number of women and men to cabinet. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Status of Women inform us of other actions this government is taking to ensure women can participate more actively in democratic and public life? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is committed to advancing gender equality in all areas of Canadian life. EOS BOS The theme of International Women's Day this year is “ EOS BOS Women's Empowerment Leads to Equality”.I recently launched a call for proposals for projects that would increase women's participation by supporting the work of indigenous women in their communities and amplifying the voices of women working to enhance their civic and political participation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this Conservative government, since taking office, has delivered a lot for Canadian municipalities. EOS BOS Thousands of infrastructure projects have received federal funding. EOS BOS Can the minister please explain how the government is planning to support recreational infrastructure going forward? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague. EOS BOS Amateur sport infrastructure projects are still eligible under the new building Canada fund. EOS BOS We have doubled the funds available for this kind of project through the gas tax. EOS BOS Mayors asked us for more flexibility with the gas tax fund, the most generous portion of the plan, and we delivered. EOS BOS With the new building Canada fund, we will support projects to make our economy more competitive, create jobs, and promote long-term growth and prosperity by supporting Canadian municipalities. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, raising the age for old age security from 65 to 67 years is nothing short of a Conservative attack on seniors. EOS BOS Conservatives claim that all seniors are flush with cash, but we know the opposite is true. EOS BOS Seniors and those nearing retirement make up more than 30% of bankruptcy filings in Ontario and have more debt than younger people have. EOS BOS Many others face growing debt and tight cashflows. EOS BOS Doubling the TFSA limits will be of no help to seniors filing for bankruptcy. EOS BOS Why do the Conservatives have such contempt for Canada's seniors? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, for seniors who have just downsized and want to invest the proceeds of their sale, or seniors who have had one spouse pass away with a small inheritance following, the tax-free savings accounts allow them to save. EOS BOS That is why almost two-thirds of those who max out their tax-free savings accounts have incomes below $60,000. EOS BOS However, the Liberal plan has a $2 billion hole and that means they will not only have to eliminate income splitting for families, but they will also eliminate it for seniors. EOS BOS Raising taxes on vulnerable seniors is the last thing we should be doing. EOS BOS We should lower their taxes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian grain farmers had a record harvest this past year. EOS BOS This bumper crop is testing our supply chain, as producers are depending on the railways to efficiently move the crops to market. EOS BOS This week, grain farmers faced the threat of a CN Rail strike. EOS BOS I understand that there is now a tentative agreement with the Teamsters. EOS BOS What concerns me is that while Conservative members were standing in the House defending farmers, an NDP member attacked the government for doing so. EOS BOS Could the Parliamentary Secretary please tell the House how our government is continuing to put hard-working Canadian farmers first? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his excellent question. EOS BOS The threat of a CN strike would be disastrous for the grain sector. EOS BOS That is why our government will, if necessary, introduce back-to-work legislation. EOS BOS However, while our priority is to protect farmers and the economy, the NDP member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie had the audacity to attack the government for doing just that. EOS BOS The member's suggestion that the government should do nothing if a strike occurred is completely offside with farmers. EOS BOS The railways are facing challenges moving grain to port. EOS BOS Canadian farmers are paying the price, and that is unacceptable. EOS BOS Our government has always put farmers first, and I ask the NDP to put farmers first. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I asked the minister specifically about when the personal data on 600,000 Canadians went missing. EOS BOS She refused to confirm when it went missing or whether the data went missing as a result of criminal actions. EOS BOS Therefore, I will ask again very clearly, but this time my question is for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS How long has this hard drive been missing, two months, four months, eight months? EOS BOS These are clear questions. EOS BOS Canadians want answers. EOS BOS When was the last time that this hard drive was in the possession of the minister's department? EOS BOS It is a simple question. EOS BOS We would just like an answer. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government takes the privacy of Canadians extremely seriously. EOS BOS This loss by the department is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been notified and an investigation is ongoing to safeguard against future incidents. EOS BOS The Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development has taken significant action and will continue to do so. EOS BOS Once again, I will emphasize that the government takes this very seriously and the loss by the department is completely unacceptable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I guess the Conservatives do not take the issue of when they last had contact with that hard drive very seriously. EOS BOS They certainly have not been forthright with sharing that with the public. EOS BOS I have another simple question. EOS BOS What about the private information of the parents or of the spouses? EOS BOS Could the parliamentary secretary share with any certainty if this information has been exposed as well? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister was very clear yesterday, and I will be clear today. EOS BOS There has been no fraudulent use of this information. EOS BOS I will emphasize again that the government takes extremely seriously the privacy of Canadians and the loss by the department of this information is completely unacceptable. EOS BOS The minister has taken action. EOS BOS We will continue to do so. EOS BOS The privacy commissioner is investigating this. EOS BOS The loss by the department is completely unacceptable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since being elected, I have met many incredible people and groups in my riding. EOS BOS I think that the people in my riding should have more access to their MPs and that it is too bad that we sometimes have to refuse, cancel, or put off such meetings. EOS BOS Can the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons explain to the House how the work he is doing to improve work-life balance in Parliament will also help the people in my riding? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Shefford for his question. EOS BOS We recognize the importance of modernizing our institutions and making them accessible to everyone, including people with children. EOS BOS We must also provide people with better access to their MPs. EOS BOS They should not have to wait, as my colleague said, sometimes more than a month to meet us in our constituency offices. EOS BOS Our constituents know the important work we have to do within our communities, and it is time that our institutions reflected that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last month, the Minister of National Defence committed to considering the proposal from the Duchess of Kent Legion, in London, to move into the officers' mess at Wolseley Barracks. EOS BOS Like so many branches of the Legion across Canada that care for and reach out to our veterans, the contribution of this Legion to the London community and our veterans is immeasurable. EOS BOS However, time is running out. EOS BOS Has the minister made a decision on the proposal? EOS BOS If not, when can the Legion and the community expect an answer? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, properties are rightly assessed to ensure they meet all requirements. EOS BOS In this case, these buildings are aging infrastructure that is almost 60 years old and is no longer suitable or required for the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS BOS The Government of Canada remains fully committed to the military presence in London; this includes a joint personnel support unit, a military family resource centre, and the reserve force units' medical and dental clinics located there. EOS BOS This government will continue to use taxpayer dollars wisely and stand up for our forces. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the urgency of getting the Commonwealth to address lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. EOS BOS Remember, in 41 of 54 member states, being gay is still illegal. EOS BOS The Prime Minister of Britain and the Australian foreign minister have now spoken out strongly saying this issue must be on the agenda for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. EOS BOS Will the minister now make the same clear commitment and ensure that these basic human rights are a priority at the Commonwealth meetings next week in Perth? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, human rights will be front and centre at the Commonwealth summit next week in Perth, Australia. EOS BOS We will be considering the adoption of the report by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, on which Senator Hugh Segal assisted, with nine other leaders in the Commonwealth. EOS BOS The rights of gays and lesbians are tremendously important. EOS BOS It is completely unacceptable that homosexuality continues to be criminalized in a majority of Commonwealth countries. EOS BOS We will certainly take that issue to the summit. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have yet to learn their lesson. EOS BOS The sudden closure of Canada's consulate in Buffalo was a complete fiasco. EOS BOS And now we hear that the Conservatives are closing Canada's consulates in Detroit and Seattle, even though there are thousands of files that have been sitting there for two or even three years, waiting to be processed. EOS BOS They are making exactly the same mistake all over again. EOS BOS While those forgotten in Buffalo are still waiting for help, how does the minister plan on managing all of these new files? EOS BOS What is his plan? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the question shows that the official opposition has absolutely no grasp of immigration-related issues. EOS BOS The offices in Detroit and Seattle dealt primarily and almost exclusively with temporary visas, not permanent visas. EOS BOS Permanent residency applications that were received in the Buffalo office and then moved to the Ottawa office are being processed more quickly than they were before. EOS BOS We have reduced the backlog of permanent residency applications by nearly half. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the opposition opposed all of the positive changes that we made. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been nine long months and 85% of the files are still waiting to be processed. EOS BOS We have been calling on the Conservatives to take action on the forgotten applications from Buffalo. EOS BOS Instead, the minister is making matters worse, closing the Detroit and Seattle immigration offices without a plan. EOS BOS How can the minister suggest that these families of men, women and children will be treated any better than those from Buffalo who are still waiting and still forgotten? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, frankly, the more the New Democrats ask about these issues the more it reflects that they have no understanding of our immigration system. EOS BOS The offices at Seattle and Detroit dealt almost entirely with visitor visas, not permanent residency visas. EOS BOS They are mixing apples and oranges. EOS BOS Here is the real problem. EOS BOS We had a total immigration backlog of permanent residency applications that capped out at a million. EOS BOS It is now close to 600,000 thanks to the actions this government has taken. EOS BOS That means we have dramatically reduced processing times. EOS BOS However, if the two opposition parties had their way, if they had defeated the power of ministerial instructions in the Immigration Act, the backlog today would be 1.6 million with 15-year wait times. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, tragically, Lucia Vega Jimenez, a Mexican women being held in detention under the authority of CBSA, hanged herself on December 20. EOS BOS She died in hospital eight days later. EOS BOS This is a sad, unnecessary loss of life, at age 42, while being held by Canadian authorities. EOS BOS My question is not about why she was being deported but about just how is it possible that a woman, naturally despondent over her situation, could commit suicide while under CBSA authority. EOS BOS Why was monitoring and supervision contracted out at this detention centre, and why this failure under the minister's watch? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, privacy legislation prevents me from discussing the details of this case, in fact any case. EOS BOS However, I do agree it is important to determine the circumstances surrounding any loss of life. EOS BOS CBSA is assisting. EOS BOS I want to assure members of the House and the Canadian public that CBSA is assisting the RCMP and the British Columbia coroners' office by providing all of the information it has on this case. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the opposition parties sadly oppose our tax cuts for northern families and, instead, propose tax hikes on the middle class. EOS BOS They even support a carbon tax, which would make life far more difficult for northern families. EOS BOS When the Liberals were in government, they failed to meet the obligations to the people in Nunavut and— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The member should know that questions should touch upon the administrative responsibilities of the government, not other parties. EOS BOS We will move on to the hon. EOS BOS member for Thunder Bay—Superior North. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I asked the Minister of Employment and Social Development to explain why it is taking so long to process the skills link program applications from organizations in my riding. EOS BOS The minister said that he could not be up on every file. EOS BOS However, I am not talking about a specific file. EOS BOS This is a general problem across Quebec. EOS BOS Do these delays have anything to do with the fact that the minister wants Ottawa to be in charge of employability measures again? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the skills training programs we have, and there are so many communities across the country that have applied for them. EOS BOS We are working with communities, employers, and non-profit organizations to deliver programs like this and services to Canadians. EOS BOS EDSC does receive many proposals, and unfortunately, not all can be selected. EOS BOS There are several organizations that do important work, some that are receiving government funding and some that are not. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Minister for International Development recently returned from a productive visit to Africa, where among other accomplishments, he was able to see first-hand some of the important work being done by Canada. EOS BOS The flagship priority of our government, as outlined in the Speech from the Throne, is maternal, child, and newborn health, along with achieving real results for those living in poverty abroad by engaging private sector expertise. EOS BOS Notwithstanding that the NDP oppose Canadian businesses at every opportunity and refuse to support any of our initiatives, would the minister offer an update on his most recent engagement in Africa? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the excellent question. EOS BOS I returned to Canada with great hope for a bright and self-sufficient future for Tanzanians. EOS BOS During my visit, I was able to underline Canada's full support in encouraging sustainable economic development to create prosperity in Africa, which will reduce poverty. EOS BOS On maternal, newborn, and child health, Canada is working to save thousands of mothers during pregnancy and childbirth as well as to prevent millions of children from dying before their fifth birthdays. EOS BOS The theme of International Development Week this year is “We are making a difference”, and Canada certainly is. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Crown has played an integral role in shaping Canada's unique history. EOS BOS It is central to our institutions of government and is at the very heart of our democratic institutions. EOS BOS The Crown is particularly relevant as we mark the final days of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. EOS BOS Like all institutions, the Canadian Crown has evolved over time and today our government is introducing legislation to formally assent to the next step in this evolution. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage please tell the House more about his legislation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, today we have tabled legislation that will ensure that gender equality will indeed be in place for all successors to the throne. EOS BOS This modernization makes good sense. EOS BOS The Prime Minister told Canadians that we would put this reform forward and we are. EOS BOS Given what we know the legislation to be about in the near future, on behalf of the government and I think indeed all members of Parliament I want to say that we wish the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge all the best in the coming months and indeed many years. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, subsequent to a Bloc Québécois motion that was unanimously adopted in the House, for nearly 10 years, the Canadian negotiation policy required negotiators to keep the supply management system intact. EOS BOS The government said repeatedly that it would defend that position. EOS BOS However, now, the Prime Minister is saying that we will have to make sacrifices during the negotiations for the trans-Pacific partnership. EOS BOS Everything seems to indicate that the federal government is preparing to sacrifice supply management. EOS BOS Can the Minister of International Trade confirm that the negotiators' mandate is still defined by the Bloc Québécois motion that received unanimous support? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, what has the Bloc Québécois done for agricultural producers in Quebec and Canada? EOS BOS Nothing. EOS BOS What will the Bloc Québécois do for them? EOS BOS Nothing. EOS BOS What we have been doing since 2006 is negotiating free trade agreements and providing economic freedom while protecting the principles of supply management. EOS BOS That is something concrete, and I am telling agricultural producers in Quebec that the past is an indication of what the future holds. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, since I am a member of the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie, and since the Minister of International Development and La Francophonie will be participating in the Sommet de la Francophonie in Madagascar in just under a month, can she tell the House what Canada is doing to fight poverty and promote inclusive growth in francophone countries? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Glengarry—Prescott— EOS BOS Russell for his question. EOS BOS Canada already contributes to a number of projects in French-speaking Africa in the areas of education, health, reproductive health, and agriculture in the era of climate change, but young Africans, particularly adolescent girls, need more opportunities to achieve their full potential and contribute to the economic growth and stability of their countries and the world. EOS BOS At the Sommet de la Francophonie in Madagascar, I will be making a series of announcements about Canada's renewed presence in French-speaking Africa. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of State for Agriculture has made a fool of himself by using the Canadian charter to explain his government's lax approach in dealing with the porcine epidemic diarrhea issue. EOS BOS In his view, respect for individual freedom would preclude the cleaning of trucks that cross the border. EOS BOS Pork producers have had enough obstacles to overcome over the past few years. EOS BOS There is no need for the minister to laugh at them too. EOS BOS If there is one serious member in this government, could he or she confirm that biosecurity measures, such as truck cleaning, will be mandatory, as demanded by MAPAQ, the Fédération des producteurs de porcs du Québec, swine veterinarians in Quebec and, finally, the Government of Quebec?Could anyone give an answer without invoking the Canadian charter to prevent the cleaning of trucks? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this virus does not pose a risk to human health or food safety. EOS BOS However, the virus is certainly a serious risk for the industry. EOS BOS That is why our government has announced that the CFIA will issue permits to authorize the administration of the iPED+ vaccine to pigs. EOS BOS The minister has asked the CFIA to work with the provinces and assist them if necessary. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, just yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs sought clemency in the Raif Badawi case, but a simple call for clemency does not mean he will be immediately and unconditionally released and reunited with this family in Quebec. EOS BOS Will the government explicitly call for the immediate and unconditional release of Raif Badawi, as required by the motion adopted unanimously by the House yesterday, so that Raif can be reunited with his family here in Quebec? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with the passage of the motion, that is exactly what we are doing. EOS BOS We consider the punishment of Mr. Badawi to be a violation of human dignity. EOS BOS There have been representations made to the ambassador and to the government, and the government will continue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is now 130 days since the Muskoka minister took a dive on accountability of the G8 slush fund. EOS BOS We now know that Huntsville was green-lighted to blow $30 million in federal money without tenders. EOS BOS We now know that the Muskoka minister got a job for his buddy. EOS BOS We now know that his campaign manager-turned-lobbyist hit up the federal government for millions in grants. EOS BOS The Auditor General said that the rules were broken and that it was Parliament's job to investigate. EOS BOS Will the government commit to a full parliamentary investigation to find out how $50 million was diverted into a personal slush fund for the rogue Muskoka minister? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it will not come as any surprise to that member or to the House that I categorically reject the premise of the member's question. EOS BOS What we do know is that I approved 32 public infrastructure projects to support municipal, provincial and airport authority infrastructure in that region. EOS BOS As the Auditor General has reported, every dollar was accounted for in terms of the municipalities that incurred these infrastructure expenses. EOS BOS The Auditor General has come forward and made reports on how we can be even more accountable and more transparent to Parliament. EOS BOS We have completely accepted her good recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board used a $50 million slush fund to award untendered contracts, give jobs to his friends and build an Olympic-sized arena, gazebos, a media centre that was never used and a campus that students do not go to. EOS BOS Last week, he described himself as the government's chief operating officer. EOS BOS First, that is very telling. EOS BOS Second, now we know why the President of the Treasury Board is not rising: his title has changed. EOS BOS Now, can the government's chief operating officer stand up and explain himself? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, all 32 of these projects had an individual contribution agreement with the municipalities or independent orders of government for which this government has always shown considerable respect. EOS BOS Each contribution agreement requires and sets out expectations and these expectations are expected to be followed. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, last week you allowed a question from a Conservative to a Conservative minister that touched on the Avon Maitland District School Board and whether or not they would be providing unpaid leave to an employee EOS BOS .I can give you many other examples of Conservative questions to Conservative ministers that have absolutely nothing to do with the federal government at all, not government operations or government administration, but those questions are allowed. EOS BOS Today we had two very relevant and pertinent questions from the member for La Pointe-de-l'Île and the member for Timmins—James Bay. EOS BOS Those questions touched on the ministry of justice, on the work of the Auditor General currently in examining the Senate spending scandal. EOS BOS Even more important, the Senate spending scandal and the Prime Minister's appointment of those senators are actually issues that have been debated in this House of Commons around appropriations bills. EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, as you know, Bill C-54 was adopted and given royal assent on March 24, 2015. EOS BOS That was a bill that was debated in this House of Commons. EOS BOS There are traditions in this House that go back for decades. EOS BOS Those traditions allow for questioning the government on its administrative responsibilities. EOS BOS Your decision today was inexplicable, and I would like to say that— EOS </s> BOS I will stop the hon. EOS BOS member there. EOS BOS As the member will know, when questions fall outside the bounds of the administration of government, as today, both on the NDP side and on the government side, as it turns out, they are ruled out of order. EOS BOS As I mentioned to the member the last time he brought this up, I can provide him with the ruling I gave in January 2014 and hope that will help him understand, going forward. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when it comes to RCMP members, the Liberal government has been taking the Conservative approach as well. EOS BOS The men and women of the RCMP put themselves on the line every day for Canadians, but on average they are making 11% less than their counterparts across the country. EOS BOS That is why back in 2015, the RCMP commissioner submitted a request for an RCMP pay raise to the Treasury Board Secretariat for approval. EOS BOS It has now been over a year since the Liberals were elected and RCMP members are still waiting for action on that raise. EOS BOS To the President of the Treasury Board, why are RCMP members still waiting for the respect and pay they deserve? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the pay issues with respect to the RCMP are important. EOS BOS This is an iconic police force. EOS BOS We want them to serve Canadians with professionalism and distinction and we will take their requests fully into consideration as the government makes its decisions with respect to future salary arrangements. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it seems as though VIA Rail has given us a raw deal. EOS BOS For months, we were promised that passenger rail service would resume in the Gaspé as soon as the railway was fixed. EOS BOS The repairs will be finished at the end of June. EOS BOS However, VIA Rail has now announced that service cannot resume because the employees were let go. EOS BOS Enough with the excuses. EOS BOS Will the government remind VIA Rail that it must follow through on its commitments, or are the Conservatives simply going to abandon the regions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would remind the member that it is this government that has been supportive of VIA Rail in terms of appropriations time and again and it is the party opposite that continues to vote against it, though members say somehow they are supportive of it.I would remind the member opposite that any decisions by VIA Rail are in fact VIA Rail's own decisions. EOS BOS It is an independent crown corporation that operates at arm's length from the government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, without warning the Conservatives have cut the direct mailing of tax packages to Canadians, which has a disproportionate effect on seniors. EOS BOS The Conservative plan to get more people to file their taxes online has security experts raising alarm bells that the new system is opening up greater chances for fraud. EOS BOS As the Privacy Commissioner now conducts her investigation, would the minister commit to sending tax packages to Canadians until the matter is resolved? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the way that Canadians file their taxes is changing and we are changing to meet those needs. EOS BOS Taxpayers can still file on paper. EOS BOS Tax forms are available on request or at their local post office or at a Service Canada centre. EOS BOS Last year more than 1.3 million packages were mailed out and never used. EOS BOS That is 80 million pieces of paper that ended up in the garbage. EOS BOS We do not think that is the best, most efficient use of our resources. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the live-in caregiver program immigration stream provides vital support for families who are looking after loved ones with physical or mental disabilities. EOS BOS Can the minister assure the House that when he finally tables the long-overdue immigration levels report, that there will not be cuts to spots available in the live-in caregiver program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleague that the caregiver program, as it is now called because the people are no longer obliged to live in, is an integral part of our immigration program. EOS BOS It provides extensive and much-needed care, not only for seniors but also for young children. EOS BOS The House can be assured that this program will remain an important part of what we do in terms of immigration. EOS
BOS I will take that as a “quite possibly”, Mr. Speaker.Immigration, via the federal skilled worker program, has long helped to build and strengthen the Canadian economy. EOS BOS With an aging workforce and major infrastructure projects on the line, provinces and territories and job-creating companies have been left waiting to hear from the government on its overdue immigration levels report so that it can plan for the future of our economy. EOS BOS Can the minister assure the House that when he finally tables this report, which is long overdue, that there will not be cuts to spots in the federal skilled worker program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member might understand that the reason the report is a little late is because something called an election happened. EOS BOS That caused the delay. EOS BOS I can assure the House that this report will be tabled within the prescribed time. EOS BOS While I cannot comment on the numbers yet, the report will produce a large number of additional refugees— EOS BOS I think we all know that—but it will also do justice to caregivers, to economic immigrants, and to the family class, all of which need our support. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Immigration says that the Liberals need to change the citizenship guide because it is a bit heavy on the War of 1812. EOS BOS Less than one page out of the 68-page book is dedicated to this nation-building event that ensured Canada's continued existence. EOS BOS Do the Liberals oppose letting new Canadians know that English, French, and first nations people can work together effectively? EOS BOS Do they oppose letting Canadians know that when we fight, even against the odds, we win? EOS BOS Why the Liberal war on history? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is a bit much. EOS BOS It leaves me a little speechless. EOS BOS We are not conducting a war on history. EOS BOS We may put in a little less than is the Conservative vision of history, but we are a party of history. EOS BOS We are a party of evidence, a party of science, and one of the worst things that party did was to abolish the long-form census. EOS BOS I think its view of history is in the same pattern. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said Americans should know more about the rest of the world, but he wants Canadians to know less about their own country. EOS BOS Now, thanks to the citizenship guide, new Canadians do know the history of their country. EOS BOS They even know the difference between the great Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge and the craven Vichy regime in France. EOS BOS Why does the Minister of Immigration want to reduce the historical literacy of new Canadians? EOS BOS Just because he does not value Canadian history does not mean that we should leave new Canadians in the dark about their country. EOS BOS Why the Liberal war on history? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to the hon. EOS BOS member that the Liberals have a great appreciation of history. EOS BOS He says I do not know history. EOS BOS I do have a Ph.D. in the economic history of Canada, so I think I know a little bit. EOS BOS We are in the process of revising this document to make it a little less political. EOS BOS However, in the end result, there will be a lot of history in there. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, DFO announced it will end the popular education program called “salmonids in the classroom”. EOS BOS For 40 years, this valuable program taught hundreds of thousands of students about the salmon life cycle. EOS BOS For a salmon-dependent region like British Columbia, to lose this cost-effective program is shameful. EOS BOS Hundreds of teachers, students, and parents have expressed their profound disappointment at this Liberal cut. EOS BOS They want the funding restored. EOS BOS Can the minister provide a clear explanation of why he made the reckless decision to kill the salmonids in the classroom program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has invested massively in marine science, ocean protection, and habitat protection.
              We are proceeding, I hope this fall, in collaboration with the members of the standing committee to restore loss protections that were taken out of the Fisheries Act. EOS BOS We recognize the important contribution that the salmonid enhancement program has made for a long time, in particular and including the work of volunteers across the province of British Columbia, including in the classrooms. EOS BOS I was in Victoria last week to announce a significant investment in exactly this kind of initiative, and we will work with these groups to ensure that this important work continues. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers understand the importance of a free trade agreement with the European Union, but they are not prepared to accept just anything. EOS BOS They cherish the richness of their culture and obviously want to protect agricultural supply management, public services and water resources. EOS BOS The Conservatives are negotiating in a vacuum and are not giving the public any information. EOS BOS They are merely providing assurances, as the parliamentary secretary did earlier, that important progress is being made in key sectors, without providing any details. EOS BOS In short, we fear the devil is in the details. EOS BOS Does the minister understand that the implications of this agreement are too important to keep Parliament and the public in the dark? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians know, farmers know, and the House knows our strong commitment to supply management. EOS BOS We promote supply management and we have defended it in our trade agreements. EOS BOS This is no different in our negotiations with the European Union. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, just days after the 25th anniversary of the Morgentaler decision and just days after we heard the Minister for Status of Women acknowledge that Canadians do not want the abortion debate reopened, we see another attempt by the Conservative backbench to do just that. EOS BOS These Conservatives are trying to get the RCMP to investigate abortions as murders. EOS BOS Will the government make it clear that this question was settled 25 years ago? EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister make it clear that he and his government understand that abortion is not murder? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think all members of the House, whether they agree with it or not, understand that abortion is legal in Canada. EOS BOS This government, myself included, have made it very clear that the government does not intend to change the law in this regard. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has consistently put victims first. While there is nothing more difficult than losing a loved one, more measures of closure can be found when Canada's missing are located and are able to be laid to rest. EOS BOS Could the Minister of Public Safety please update the House on the steps that have been taken to ensure that law enforcement has effective tools to help locate missing individuals and identify remains? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the RCMP has launched a new national website for missing persons and unidentified remains at www.canadasmissing.ca. EOS BOS This website gives the public a chance to make a difference and help bring closure to the families of the victims of a sampling of missing persons cases from across Canada. EOS BOS We will continue to build on our government's strong record of standing up for victims. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, documentary evidence confirms that the Minister of National Defence is having some trouble with the truth. EOS BOS Military officers say the story about showcasing search and rescue helicopters is “a guise” to hide a minister wrongfully commandeering defence equipment for his own personal use. EOS BOS The definition of “guise” is “pretence, make-believe”, and this one cost tens of thousands of dollars. EOS BOS When first nations children are living in desperate conditions at Attawapiskat, why does the government defend such waste and dishonesty? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has already answered these questions. EOS BOS There are really no new facts here. EOS BOS The fundamental facts remain the same. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence paid for air travel to and from his personal vacation; government aircraft were used only when he was called away on government business. EOS BOS Our government has reduced average annual spending on ministers' Challenger flights by some 80% compared with the previous Liberal government. EOS BOS It was not that difficult, because that hon. EOS BOS member used to use the Challenger every weekend as his personal taxi to get home. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, David Orchard would recognize what is going on here, as do the brave men and women of the Canadian Forces, and they have blown the whistle. EOS BOS Search and rescue equipment was misused. EOS BOS It took not one trip, but a reconnaissance mission too. EOS BOS It cost $32,000 per hour. EOS BOS The chopper could not land. EOS BOS The minister had to be hoisted aboard in a basket, and all the while quick, inexpensive alternatives were available by land and boat. EOS BOS Before this guise gets any worse, why will the government not simply accept the honesty of Colonel Ploughman and apologize? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, none of the facts here have changed. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence paid for the travel to and from his own personal vacation. EOS BOS Government aircraft were only used when he was called away on government business. EOS BOS Without any facts and without any changes, I know the hon. EOS BOS member can make a great deal of noise. EOS BOS I know he knows a lot about the use of government aircraft from his own personal experience. EOS BOS Our practices are very different from those of his government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that is not what the emails say. EOS BOS Under the pretext of participating in a search and rescue mission, the Minister of National Defence hailed a flying taxi at a cost of $32,000 an hour. EOS BOS A rescue helicopter is like a fire truck or an ambulance. EOS BOS The Department of National Defence is not a Toys "R" Us. EOS BOS The minister does not seem to understand that this is serious. EOS BOS Why does he have such contempt for the Canadian Forces? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has already answered all these questions. EOS BOS There are no new facts here. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence paid for the travel to and from his personal vacation. EOS BOS Government aircraft were used only when he was called away on government business. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this morning's edition of Le Devoir stated that Donald Trump intends to renegotiate NAFTA and that he wants to abolish the cultural exemption that has protected our distinct culture for 30 years. EOS BOS This means that our films, our music, and all of Quebec culture will get no protection from the American steamroller. EOS BOS Even Liza Frulla, president of ADISQ, is sounding the alarm. EOS BOS This morning, she had this to say about the minister: “ EOS BOS Her intentions are still not clear. EOS BOS We want to know what the federal government's position is on this file.” EOS BOS When it is at the negotiating table, the government will have to defend our distinct culture. EOS BOS One must be clear when negotiating. EOS BOS Will the minister immediately declare that the cultural exemption in our free trade agreements is non-negotiable? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his important question and recognize his passion for this matter. EOS BOS Of course we recognize the important contribution of the arts and culture to society and Canada's economy. EOS BOS NAFTA negotiations have not begun. EOS BOS However, if Canada receives notification of the intent to negotiate, we will be ready EOS BOS .
              I would like to remind my colleague that cultural diversity is the basis for my efforts. EOS BOS That is why I am working in Canada and abroad to preserve cultural diversity in the digital age. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, subsequent to the point of order my colleague from Joliette raised on November 8, I would like to share some additional observations that I hope will inform your consideration of the matter. EOS BOS I also believe that the vote was marred by irregularities and should be retaken. EOS BOS As my colleague from Joliette said, the code of conduct for members of Parliament, which is part of our Standing Orders, clearly prohibits an elected member from furthering his or her private interests. EOS BOS In addition to taking part in the vote on Motion No. EOS BOS 42, a motion that will have an impact on his private interests, the Minister of Finance influenced the debate through his then-parliamentary secretary, the member for Saint-Maurice— EOS BOS Champlain. EOS BOS As stated in the “ EOS BOS Guide for Parliamentary Secretaries”, issued by the Prime Minister on January 16, 2016, a parliamentary secretary speaks on behalf of the minister. EOS BOS In other words, when a parliamentary secretary takes the floor in the House, it is the minister's words that we hear, as we can see on pages 1 and 2 of the guide. EOS BOS On page 1, under Your Role and Responsibilities, it says:
              
                
                  Section 47 of the Parliament of Canada Act sets out the following succinct job description: “ EOS BOS The Parliamentary Secretary or Secretaries to a minister shall assist the minister in such manner as the minister directs.” EOS BOS In this context, the responsibilities of parliamentary secretaries generally fall into two broad categories: (1) House business and (2) department-related duties. EOS BOS On page 2, under House Business, it says:
              
                
                  In this context, the role of parliamentary secretaries in supporting ministers’ House duties includes:
                
              
              
                
                  --attending Question Period; 
                
              
              
                
                  --piloting the minister’s legislation through the legislative process on the floor of the House, in parliamentary committees...and with caucus and opposition MPs;
                
              
              
                
                  --supporting the minister’s position on Private Members’ Business;
                
              
              Later on, the guide specifically talks about the role of parliamentary secretaries with respect to private members' business. EOS BOS On page 4, under Private Members' Business, the guide states:
              
                
                  Given that ministers do not generally participate directly in debates on Private Members’ Business, this is an opportunity for parliamentary secretaries to bring their parliamentary skills to bear. EOS BOS This is particularly so since all Private Members’ Business comes to a vote. EOS BOS Parliamentary secretaries play a key role in the Government's handling of Private Members’ Business, in that they: 
                
              
              
                
                  --may be called upon to speak for the minister during Private Members’ Hour; 
                
              
              
                
                  --work with the Government House Leader’s office to organize and deliver the minister’s response to Private Members’ Bills and motions;
                
              
              As members can see, Minister of Finance, by way of his his parliamentary secretary, reassured members of the House about the government's actions on this matter. EOS BOS He also urged them to vote against Motion No. EOS BOS 42. EOS BOS I remind members that if this motion had passed, it would have affected the minister's personal interests. EOS BOS I want to be clear. EOS BOS The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance should have recused himself from the debates on Motion No. EOS BOS 42, since he speaks on behalf of his minister. EOS BOS I repeat, this minister's interests are directly affected by Motion No. 42. EOS BOS As my colleague from Joliette pointed out, we are talking about the results of a vote and about the integrity of the House of Commons as an institution, which you oversee, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS We are here, at the heart of representative democracy, and at the heart of the trust that the public must have in its representatives. EOS BOS This vote should be taken again, since it was tainted. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. member for Montcalm for raising this point of order. EOS BOS As he said, it is related to another point of order that was recently raised by the hon. EOS BOS member for Joliette and that I already responded to, but I will come back to the House at a later time. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Manicouagan on a point of order. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I wish to seek consent for the following motion: That this House call on the Department of Transport to prohibit the carrying of a knife with a blade measuring less than six centimetres on board aircraft. EOS </s> BOS Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members:  No. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP continue to mislead Canadians on trade. EOS BOS They forget that one in five Canadian jobs is generated through exports. EOS BOS While the NDP snipes from the sidelines, our government is busy opening new markets for our exporters. EOS BOS We have signed free trade agreements with nine countries, investment protection agreements with eleven more, and are negotiating with some of the largest and most dynamic markets in the world. EOS BOS Could the parliamentary secretary please share with the House how our government is standing up for Canadian exporters? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder that the NDP wants to hide from its anti-trade record. EOS BOS Its members opposed free trade with Norway. EOS BOS They opposed free trade with Liechtenstein. EOS BOS They opposed NAFTA. EOS BOS The NDP member for Burnaby—New Westminster even worked against Canadian exporters, calling Buy American a perfectly logical policy. EOS BOS The NDP wants a Canada that hides from the world. EOS BOS Only our government's ambitious pro-trade plan is creating new opportunities for our workers and our exporters. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, young people across this country are looking for work, but coming up against closed doors. EOS BOS The Conservative plan is not working. EOS BOS The youth unemployment rate is twice as high as the national average. EOS BOS If youth employment for my generation were a priority for this government, we would not have an unemployment rate as high as it was in 2009, at the height of the recession. EOS BOS Conservative inaction is costing the youth of my generation $11 billion. EOS BOS What exactly do the Conservatives plan to do to tackle the abnormally high rate of youth unemployment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, why does the NDP not make this a priority and support what this government is doing with the youth employment strategy to make sure that young Canadians have opportunities for employment?This government has been focused on creating jobs, in fact, 920,000 net new jobs; 50,000 of which were through the youth employment strategy. EOS BOS I encourage the NDP, when it is given another chance, to support our youth employment strategy because that is what helps create Canadian jobs. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I was not going to rise on this point of order today, but after the exchange between the Conservative leader and the government today and the obvious lack of respect for the people of Alberta, I thought I would rise on this point of order. EOS BOS Yesterday, during the vote on a private member's bill, the member for Lakeland stood and we applauded. EOS BOS I thought I heard from the other side a disparaging comment about the people of Vegreville. EOS BOS I would like to give the hon. EOS BOS member who said it an opportunity to apologize, not just to the people of Vegreville but to the member as well. EOS </s> BOS I thank the hon. member for Barrie— EOS BOS Innisfil for raising his point of order. EOS BOS He says he thought he heard something. EOS BOS If a member wishes to apologize for something he or she said, I am prepared to hear that. EOS BOS I do not see anyone rising. EOS BOS I do not know what else the hon. EOS BOS member for Barrie—Innisfil has to add to this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order, I believe there were Liberal members who heard this as well. I believe it was the member for Newmarket—Aurora, so I would like to give him an opportunity to apologize. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am baffled by this. EOS BOS I did not say anything disparaging at all, so I do not know how to address this. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, under our Constitution, managing natural resources falls under provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS Therefore, we have a simple question for the Prime Minister: does he think that the provinces have a say when foreign dictatorships try to grab a piece of their natural resources? EOS BOS Do the provinces have a say in the matter, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have the Investment Canada Act. EOS BOS Under the process set out by the legislation, the government consults with the provinces and territories on a regular basis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there he goes again, confusing Investment Canada with the China FIPA that he just signed. EOS BOS Now that the Government of China owns Nexen, it is to be treated like any other Canadian company. EOS BOS It is therefore allowed to buy up an unlimited number of oil and gas leases in this country. EOS BOS It has nothing whatsoever to do with an Investment Canada review. EOS BOS I repeat my question for the Prime Minister. EOS BOS He promised two years ago that foreign countries, especially foreign dictatorships, would not be allowed to get their hands on Canadian resources. EOS BOS Why is he denying Alberta the right to control its resources? EOS BOS Why is he selling out Alberta resources? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it would take an amazing leap of logic for anybody in Alberta to think the NDP is going to trust their resources to them. EOS BOS Our foreign investment protection acts are subject to the Investment Canada Act, and obviously, in the case we have before us, this is an agreement we have reached with the Government of China that is widely and strongly supported by Canadian investors, because they need these protections, and we are making sure that our exporters and investors have legal protections in this market. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, perhaps when the Prime Minister is in Washington then, he can ask President Obama to reverse his decision on Keystone and make— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh!
							[Translation]Hon EOS BOS . Rona Ambrose: EOS BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberal members will have an opportunity to vote on the Conservative motion and help Bombardier sell more planes, but the Liberals keep getting in the way, especially the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. EOS BOS Why would the Prime Minister rather reward his friend than help Bombardier create good jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, even after their defeat in the last election, the Conservatives are still trying to pit one part of the country against another. EOS BOS We respect local desires, concerns, and interests. EOS BOS That is how you build a strong country, rather than exploiting the differences between provinces for ideological, strategic, and political purposes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Toronto island airport is a driver of jobs and economic growth. EOS BOS Allowing it to expand would create a multi-billion customer for the new Bombardier C Series and create thousands of jobs in Toronto and Montreal. EOS BOS The Liberals just do not understand that jobs do not come out of thin air. EOS BOS Will the minister get out of the way, approve the expansion, and help get the C Series program off the ground? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we were delighted to hear recently that Air Canada intends to buy 45 airplanes from the C Series because it believes in this aircraft, which, by the way, is the best in its class in the world. EOS BOS We can also be proud of the fact that the Quebec government is intending to drop its litigation against Air Canada. EOS BOS We are making progress in creating jobs in the aerospace industry in this country. EOS BOS I would like to know why the member for Beauce thinks that the C Series is not an airplane that anyone wants to buy. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Bombardier's new plane is quieter than those that were allowed to land at the Toronto island airport when the tripartite agreement was signed in 1983. EOS BOS Rather than block the creation of good jobs, the minister should follow his own advice and use evidence-based decision-making to modernize the regulations governing the use of this airport. EOS BOS Will the minister accept the evidence, consider the thousands of jobs created, and allow the Toronto island airport to expand? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I will say it again. I had the opportunity this morning to make a 20-minute speech, but the official opposition members have obviously had difficulty understanding the basis of our decision with respect to the tripartite agreement. EOS BOS We made it very clear that we were achieving the right balance between commercial interests and the interests of the community. EOS BOS We do care about local issues. EOS BOS Unfortunately, the current opposition does not seem to share the same approach. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in recent years, every time Ottawa has negotiated an agreement, it has used supply management as a bargaining chip. EOS BOS When it wanted to open the European market to western beef producers, Quebec paid the price. EOS BOS When it wanted to open the trans-Pacific market to grain producers, our Quebec producers paid the price. EOS BOS The worst part is that Ottawa cannot even be bothered to give them appropriate compensation. EOS BOS With the Minister of Finance on his way to Washington, can the government guarantee that, for once, supply management will not be used as a bargaining chip? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as my hon. EOS BOS colleague is well aware, we have and will continue to support the agricultural sector in our country, including supply management. EOS BOS My hon. EOS BOS colleague is well aware that we put a $350 million fund in place for innovation in the dairy farming processing sector. EOS BOS What the government is doing is making sure the farmers and the processing sector have the tools in order to do the job. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Americans are engaging in unfair competition by generously subsidizing dairy products, but the federal government is turning a blind eye and letting our people down. EOS BOS The reason supply management is not covered by NAFTA is to protect Quebec dairy producers, who are the first to pay the price for Ottawa's neglect. EOS BOS Now that he has his limousine and his portfolio for betraying Quebec to the banks, will the Minister of International Trade do something to protect supply management? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question. EOS BOS He will be pleased to know that I met with dairy producers just this morning to reaffirm our commitment to supply management in Canada. EOS BOS We will work for all Canadians. EOS BOS We are working for farmers. EOS BOS We are working to promote trade by creating jobs. EOS BOS That is what we promised to do, and we will keep that promise. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the failure on Keystone shows how this out-of-touch government is mishandling our key trading partnerships. EOS BOS The Americans understand that protecting the economy and the environment go hand in hand, yet our government has stuck its head in the oil sands, exporting unrefined bitumen and killing thousands of Canadian jobs. EOS BOS Thankfully for Canadians, New Democrat MPs have flown to Washington to help explain that most Canadians disagree with the Conservatives. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives start putting Canadian jobs and the environment first? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in a bizarre anti-trade mission the NDP has travelled to Washington to fight against the creation of Canadian jobs. EOS BOS Apparently, those NDP members forgot to ask for permission from their union bosses. EOS BOS Today, Buzz Hargrove supported the Keystone project because it would generate thousands of jobs. EOS BOS The NDP is totally out of touch with ordinary Canadians and economic reality. EOS BOS Send in the clowns. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as the opposition leader, the Prime Minister appeared on Fox News and criticized the Canadian government for refusing to go to Iraq. EOS BOS Conservatives know what our MPs are doing in Washington. EOS BOS What the Conservatives failed to do was stand up for Canadian jobs and the environment. EOS BOS Like Americans with Keystone, first nations communities in B.C. do not want the risky Enbridge and TMX pipelines going through their communities. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop playing oil sands cheerleader and agree to consult and protect British Columbian communities? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are extremely fortunate to have the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world. EOS BOS This project will generate hundreds of thousands of jobs, trillions of dollars in economic activity and revenue to support social services, including education and health. EOS BOS Are the NDP members so star-struck by jet-setting Hollywood stars that they are blind to the needs of Canadian workers and their families? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government does not understand that in the 21st century, jobs and the environment go hand in hand. EOS BOS That is why two of my colleagues are currently in Washington to pick up the government's slack. EOS BOS The United States has decided to allow more time for studying the Keystone pipeline project because it is concerned about the environmental impact. EOS BOS However, on this side of the border, the Conservatives continue to move forward with blinders on. EOS BOS Will this government follow the example of our neighbours to the South and take the time to truly assess the environmental and economic impact of the Keystone pipeline project? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Keystone XL will create tens of thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in economic activity. EOS BOS These revenues will help fund important social services such as health care and education. EOS BOS Nonetheless, the NDP has gone to the United States, determined to hinder this project and job prospects for Canadians. EOS BOS The NDP position would be laughable if it were not so harmful to Canada's national interests. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are in Washington to tell Americans that the majority of Canadians want natural resources to be developed in a sustainable manner. EOS BOS Both the environment and thousands of jobs are at risk. EOS BOS Several refineries have already closed their doors in Montreal East resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs, especially in my riding. EOS BOS The facts are there and speak for themselves. EOS BOS Now the government wants to export thousands of jobs outside the country. EOS BOS That is exactly what will happen with the Keystone project. EOS BOS When will this government prepare a plan for the sustainable development of Canadian resources and the accompanying jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the NDP seems oblivious to the facts and does not listen very well either. EOS BOS This project would generate hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity. EOS BOS Does the NDP care at all about Canadian workers and their families? EOS BOS Is it so ideologically driven that it is blind to the interests of Canadians? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government should be presenting its plan and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions today. EOS BOS Unfortunately, I think we are never going to see that plan. EOS BOS The government's inaction is making Canada a laughingstock in the eyes of its allies. EOS BOS Mexico submitted its plan. EOS BOS The United States presented its commitment and Russia is doing the same as we speak. EOS BOS Why is Canada the black sheep on this issue? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we will submit Canada's greenhouse gas emissions targets in the weeks ahead. EOS BOS We are seeking information from the provinces and the territories on how they will meet their targets. EOS BOS Our Conservative government is the first government in Canadian history to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. EOS BOS We will continue to take action in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, without introducing a job-killing carbon tax supported by the Liberals and the NDP. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister's talking points continue to be more fiction than fact, because the government consistently misses deadlines. EOS BOS It missed its own repeated deadlines for oil and gas regulations, and it is on track to miss its reduction targets. EOS BOS Now it is missing out on an important North American approach to fighting climate change. EOS BOS Why is Canada refusing to co-operate with Mexico and the United States, our NAFTA partners, when it comes to protecting our environment and our economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we welcome the United States' announcement. We have always said that to effectively reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, all major emitters must be on board. EOS BOS Canada has one of the cleanest electricity system supplies in the world, our energy coming from sources that emit no greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the United States has only 30%.Leading up to Paris, we will continue to take action to reduce emissions, without introducing a job-killing carbon tax supported by the NDP and the Liberals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is not only missing in action, it is missing the point. EOS BOS Not only is climate change a threat to our health, our environment, and our economy, it is an economic opportunity that is waiting for us. EOS BOS A study by the new NewClimate Institute shows that the U.S. targets announced today will reduce its reliance on foreign oil, avoid 7,000 premature pollution deaths every year, and create 470,000 renewable energy jobs by 2030.When exactly is the minister going to stop stalling and announce Canada's commitment? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have stated, Canada will be submitting the greenhouse gas emissions targets in the weeks ahead. EOS BOS We are seeking information from the provinces as well as the territories on how they will meet their targets. EOS BOS Our Conservative government is the first government in Canadian history that has reduced greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. EOS BOS We will continue to take action, without introducing a carbon tax, proposed by the NDP and supported by the Liberals. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration got a little hung up on this question yesterday, so I would like to give the Prime Minister a chance to answer. EOS BOS How many Syrian refugees have been brought into Canada? EOS BOS [Translation]How many Syrian refugees are on Canadian soil? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am rather surprised these days to hear the leader of the NDP saying someone else got hung up on answering some questions.I believe it is over 1,000. EOS BOS In the meantime, in terms of helping Syrian refugees or any of the activities the Government of Canada is involved in, the leader of the NDP should return the improper funds that his party took on mailings and offices and make sure we can do good things for Canadians and for people around the world. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that answer is still a little off.
							[ EOS BOS Translation]How many of the 200 refugees that the government promised to sponsor have actually made it here to Canada?Can the Prime Minister tell us that? EOS BOS [English]How many of the government-sponsored refugees that Canada promised to help have actually made it here to Canada? EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister tell us that? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think I have answered the question. EOS BOS Canada has been one of the biggest contributors to refugee assistance around the world. EOS BOS Once again, the real question that Canadians are asking is when the NDP is going to return the public money that it took completely illicitly to use on partisan mailings and partisan offices under the guise of parliamentary spending. EOS BOS The NDP knows, from top to bottom, that this was inappropriate, incorrect, and fraudulent. EOS BOS It should do the right thing and return the money. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, let us look at real generosity toward refugees. EOS BOS Lebanon, a country of 4.8 million people, has taken in over a million Syrian refugees. EOS BOS Turkey has taken in 800,000 refugees. EOS BOS Canada has promised to take in 200—not 200,000, but 200.How many of the 200 refugees that the government said it would take in have actually made it to Canada? EOS BOS He still has not answered. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, obviously hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, where they are temporarily residing. EOS BOS I do not think it is an intention of those countries to resettle literally millions of Syrians in their countries. EOS BOS The Government of Canada will continue to assist Syrian refugees by bringing some to Canada and helping those who are sheltered around the world. EOS BOS I visited some in Jordan. EOS BOS However, once again, none of this excuses the NDP from misusing public funds for partisan purposes. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I was elected by people who understand that Liberal policies, especially the carbon tax, destroy economic opportunities and drive up costs for families in my riding. EOS BOS Carbon taxes diminish our competitiveness, hurt our economy, and negatively impact Canadians who are already struggling to make ends meet. EOS BOS Will the Liberals finally listen to hard-working Canadians and scrap the carbon tax? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives of the previous government had a Democrat in the White House for almost a decade, and they accomplished nothing to address climate change. EOS BOS Now with a Republican in the White House, they want Canada to continue to do nothing. EOS BOS That is not the approach we plan to take. EOS BOS Canadians voted for a government that would transition to a low-carbon economy to stimulate growth, provide access to new markets, and create good, middle-class jobs. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are going to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I know that the Prime Minister respects the French language, and Canadians appreciate the fact that he answers questions in French. EOS BOS However, the Conservatives' political decisions should reflect that respect. EOS BOS For example, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is cutting funding for French-language newspapers, such as Manitoba's La Liberté and Sudbury's Le Voyageur, in half. EOS BOS The minister says that he cannot do anything because there is a formula, but the minister is the one who came up with the formula. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister scrap the minister's formula, or the minister for that matter, and save Canada's French-language newspapers? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this government's level of support for such activities is unprecedented. EOS BOS Our commitment to the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality is unprecedented. EOS BOS Also unprecedented is the fact that the NDP fields unilingual candidates in francophone ridings. EOS BOS The Conservative Party has never done that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to move the following motion:MotionThat, at the conclusion of today's debate on the opposition motion in the name of the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan, all questions necessary to dispose of the motion be deemed put and a recorded division deemed requested and deferred to Tuesday, February 5, 2013, at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders. EOS </s> BOS Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to propose this motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS BOS (Motion agreed to) EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if that were accurate, the Liberals would release the numbers. EOS BOS Canadians are worried about the Prime Minister's plan to impose a carbon tax, while refusing to say just how much this tax will cost them. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is not being transparent on the carbon tax, and now he will not tell Canadians how much they are going to have to pay for his out-of-control spending. EOS BOS Canadians are worried that he is hiding his real agenda. EOS BOS Will the Liberals tell Canadians today whether they are planning on axing income splitting for seniors in this upcoming budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government has made a commitment to helping seniors within this country. EOS BOS It is our government that reversed the age of retirement from 67 to 65. EOS BOS We have also put in place an increase in the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors, and we have made an increase of 10%. EOS BOS That is substantial for seniors, because it is, on average, $1,000 more a month. EOS BOS Our government is committed to helping seniors, and we are going to continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is not just the Coast Guard. EOS BOS Conservatives have also wilfully ignored concerns from across British Columbia about the northern gateway pipeline. EOS BOS Concerns have come from the coast, from communities along the proposed route and first nations, and these voices of British Columbians have been dismissed by the government. EOS BOS British Columbians have been clear. EOS BOS We want to protect our sensitive coastal environment and we want to protect the good jobs that come from a clean environment. EOS BOS Why are Conservatives refusing to listen? EOS BOS Why are they gutting our environmental protection laws? EOS BOS Why are they running roughshod over British Columbians? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth and the member opposite knows that. EOS BOS He knows full well that the northern gateway pipeline is being reviewed by an independent panel. EOS BOS That panel is basing its determination on science, not on, in spite of what he would like, partisanship. EOS BOS The review is an open process. EOS BOS People have been able to come and make their presentations. EOS BOS Interested parties, including aboriginal groups, have come and expressed their views. EOS BOS The member opposite should take his own advice and be willing to listen to the people. EOS BOS We will see where this project goes when the review is done. EOS
BOS Amendment negatived I declare the amendment defeated. EOS </s> BOS The next question is on the main motion. EOS BOS [English]
							 The question is on the motion. EOS BOS Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Agreed. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: No. EOS BOS The Speaker: All those in favour of the motion will please say yea. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Yea. EOS BOS The Speaker: All those opposed will please say nay. EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: Nay. EOS BOS The Speaker: In my opinion the nays have it. EOS BOS And five or more members having risen: EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, there are motions in front of the immigration committee to study the illegal border crossing crisis. EOS BOS This urgent situation is straining resources of the RCMP, the CBSA, provincial housing, legal aid, and health care services. EOS BOS Canadians are confused as to why the Liberals shut down debate on this matter not once but twice. EOS BOS Would the chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration please update Canadians as to when this urgent will be debated at committee, or are the Liberals just going to keep shutting it down over and over again? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows well, it is the committee itself that decides what studies to study and which studies they will study in the future. EOS BOS Presently we are studying immigration consultants, an issue of tremendous importance, and the House mandated us to do an Atlantic immigration study, which we will be doing throughout the rest of this session and into the fall. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I get the feeling that many Canadians will not be satisfied with that answer. EOS BOS The Prime Minister could be doing many things to address this issue, including closing a loophole in the safe third country agreement. EOS BOS Instead, the Liberals have announced a whole— EOS BOS wait for it—$30,000 for first responders in Manitoba. EOS BOS For those counting, that is a whopping $609 more than they just spent on Broadway tickets for wealthy investment bankers. EOS BOS My question simply is this: can the Prime Minister stand up and tell Canadians why his priority is Broadway and not the border? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our priority is applying Canadian law and keeping Canadians safe. EOS BOS In fact, crossing the border in an irregular fashion is no free ticket to Canada. EOS BOS Those people are apprehended, they are identified biographically and biometrically, and their information is checked against data systems in Canada as well as internationally. EOS BOS If there is a danger, they are detained and they go before the IRB to hear their claims, and if their claims cannot be justified, then deportation proceedings are commenced. EOS BOS The law is applied, as are Canadian treaties. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise again today to speak about a potential disaster in Notre Dame Bay in Newfoundland. EOS BOS It deals with the Manolis L. which is a sunken large ship off the coast. EOS BOS It was leaking oil. EOS BOS The Coast Guard has done a patch job on it to make sure no more oil is getting out. EOS BOS However, it a very serious issue. EOS BOS There are over 520 tons of fuel oil still in that ship on the ocean floor. EOS BOS This could be a large-scale environmental disaster for the northeast of Newfoundland. EOS BOS I beg this government, I beg this minister, what is the next step to get that oil out of the water? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government continues to monitor the situation very closely. EOS BOS Divers have been down on the vessel. EOS BOS A program of containment and remediation is under way. EOS BOS When conditions permit, action will be taken to contain this spill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are demanding to know why the government is continuing to push the reckless northern gateway pipeline project. EOS BOS It is not only a significant danger to the environment and the economy, but B.C.'s mayors, first nations and businesses are all lined up against it. EOS BOS Now we learn that the government's own officials at Natural Resources Canada have told the Conservative government that there is already enough capacity in the pipeline system for exports. EOS BOS Will the natural resources minister from Toronto finally stand in his place and tell the people of British Columbia why he is willing to put our way of life and our environment at risk for his friends in the oil sector? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of the Environment has referred the northern gateway pipeline project to a joint review panel, which is the highest level of scrutiny possible. EOS BOS This review is an open process where any interested party, including aboriginal groups, can express their views. EOS BOS We are committed to ensuring that any project is environmentally sustainable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government cannot continue to hide behind the joint review panel while spending millions to push the project. EOS BOS From the beginning, the people of British Columbia have said that the risks far outweigh the benefits, not only from the pipeline but from the hundreds of oil tankers that would be operating off our coast. EOS BOS Why will the government not just say no to Enbridge and ban oil tankers off our B.C. coast? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the National Energy Board is a strong independent regulator that ensures pipeline safety. EOS BOS It is mandated to ensure the safety and the security of pipelines from when they are first proposed until they are abandoned. EOS BOS Unlike the opposition member, I do not believe that decisions should be influenced by cheap politics. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this government is finally responding to NDP pressure to build a new Champlain Bridge. EOS BOS We barely had time to celebrate— EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS Is there a problem with the translation?The hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we hope the bridge will not be built in Muskoka. EOS BOS We barely had time to celebrate before we learned that families will be the ones footing the bill. EOS BOS Why is the government taking money from families instead of making their lives more affordable? EOS BOS Can the government tell us how much each family must pay to cross the bridge? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is an odd question. EOS BOS I have an article here written by Louis-Gilles Francoeur on December 23, 2005. EOS BOS This article says that in a hotel in Montreal North in December 2005, the member for Outremont, then the environment and sustainable development minister, openly said he was in favour of extending Highway 25 and the bridge, a project that included tolls. EOS BOS Some people began to call it the Mulcair Bridge . EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport is saying that there will be a toll on the Champlain Bridge but that the bridge will not cost taxpayers a penny. EOS BOS Let us be clear, it is families that will pay. EOS BOS The municipalities of Montreal's south shore are wondering why their residents will be the only ones footing the bill. EOS BOS Families are also wondering why they are being punished. EOS BOS It is currently free to cross the bridge. EOS BOS Why should families have to pay? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, this is an odd question because the member for Brossard—La Prairie has also publicly stated that he is open to a toll system. EOS BOS I do not understand this double standard. EOS BOS Everyone is happy about the bridge. EOS BOS They should be looking at this in a positive light and stop casting a shadow on this wonderful news. EOS BOS There will finally be a new Champlain Bridge that will be sustainable for future generations and affordable for Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS That is what is important. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's vague announcement is going to hurt Montreal families right in their pocketbooks. EOS BOS First, it decided to ding commuters every time they go to work; then, it saddles taxpayers with a cost overrun we know will come from these risky private ventures. EOS BOS Could the minister tell this House who will own the bridge? EOS BOS Does he even know how much these tolls will cost? EOS BOS Will the government have any say? EOS BOS Or will the new bridge become a cash cow for some private company? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I just stated what the member for Brossard— EOS BOS La Prairie said and I will quote him. EOS BOS He said, “ EOS BOS In terms of tolls, it's still to be seen. EOS BOS Like we've always said, we're open. EOS BOS With regard to the Champlain Bridge's replacement, we're not dismissing the idea of tolls”.What is the problem today? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I will also try to build bridges. EOS BOS The Champlain Bridge construction project contains no plans for public transit. EOS BOS The minister says that that is a provincial responsibility, but if this bridge is 100% federal, as he likes to remind everyone, why are there no plans for federal-provincial coordination of public transit? EOS BOS That is important. EOS BOS So, the federal government is going to spend $5 billion on the bridge, while, at the same time, further down the same road, the provincial government is spending $3 billion on the Turcot project. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives work in partnership with Quebec for more public transit, or is $8 billion going to be spent to wind up with the same congestion problems? EOS BOS Talk about short-sightedness. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear: everyone seems to agree that a toll system is a viable solution for Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS Finally, a new bridge will be built. EOS BOS The Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities has been very clear. EOS BOS We have taken the first step. EOS BOS We know where we are headed. EOS BOS We know that this viable infrastructure will be there for future generations. EOS BOS Yes, consultations will be held with the mayors in question and with the province in order to maximize this investment. EOS BOS That is how we will move forward. EOS BOS Let us be clear: this viable infrastructure will serve future generations and will be affordable for Canadian taxpayers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary referred to the fact that there are taxes that are a real burden on Canadians and I think everyone could agree. EOS BOS The issue that really arises right now is the question of taxes on employment. EOS BOS It is the question of the proposal by the government to increase taxation on employment by $1.2 billion starting January 1, 2012.I ask the Minister of Human Resources, does the government not understand that this is a killer of jobs, a direct attack on employment and is going to further hurtle us toward a recession? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let us take a look at our record through our economic action plan. EOS BOS We have created almost 600,000 net new jobs since the worst of the recession. EOS BOS That is a record unparalleled in the developed world. EOS BOS We did that in a number of ways including putting a freeze on EI premiums. EOS BOS We had to do that to make sure that companies were encouraged or at least were not prevented from employing people. EOS BOS We also have to strike a balance and make sure that the EI fund is balanced. EOS BOS That was our commitment to Canadians, that we would not create a $53 billion EI surplus like the Liberals did. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in its report, the RCMP says that the anti-petroleum movement—the RCMP's word, not mine—is a threat to Canada. EOS BOS No one here encourages or tolerates violence. EOS BOS However, this report clearly targets environmental organizations. EOS BOS In light of Bill C-51, that is very strong language. EOS BOS Does the minister think that environmentalists really pose a risk to the stability of the Canadian economy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our bill is clear. EOS BOS It targets people who commit acts of terrorism. EOS BOS Now, the RCMP also wants to monitor people who commit such acts. EOS BOS The member should read clause 2 of the bill, which clearly states that peaceful demonstrations, protests, and dissent are not covered by the bill. EOS BOS That should reassure her. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians are right to be concerned that the Conservatives are going too far with this bill. EOS BOS Yesterday the minister failed to explain how the bill would impact legitimate dissent, and so today let us talk about another section. EOS BOS Bill C-51 proposes a new criminal offence: to advocate or promote terrorism in general. EOS BOS Canada already has strong laws that make it an offence to incite a terrorist act. EOS BOS Can the minister provide a single example showing that such a new offence is necessary? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we saw this weekend that Copenhagen and the world are at war with the jihadist international movement. EOS BOS Our anti-terrorism bill is clear. EOS BOS Our security agencies can only target those who pose a risk to Canada and not legitimate dissent. EOS BOS The member should read clause 2 of the bill, which clearly states that an activity that undermines the security of Canada “does not include lawful advocacy, protest, dissent and artistic expression”. EOS BOS Please read the bill. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the word “ EOS BOS lawful” is a new insertion there, which seems to say that most dissent is something other than lawful. EOS BOS Today the government failed to give us a single example of the new activities CSIS would be allowed to engage in to disrupt under Bill C-51. EOS BOS The minister still cannot clearly explain the provisions of the bill that experts think will impact legitimate dissent and free speech. EOS BOS How can Canadians trust the current government if members will not answer basic questions about what is in the bill with anything except talking points? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, last week, we saw the NDP oppose a bill to fight terrorism. EOS BOS Yesterday, we saw them oppose measures to improve parliamentary security on the Hill. EOS BOS They are even incapable of saying that the attacks on October 22, here in Ottawa, were terrorist attacks. EOS BOS Canadians can count on our government to put effective measures in place to protect Canada from terrorism. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two-thirds of the members of the Association des économistes québécois support regulations governing credit card processing fees.Credit card processing fees for merchants are excessive and affect a company's profitability. EOS BOS The Conservatives need to implement mandatory regulations instead of an ineffective voluntary code of conduct. EOS BOS Otherwise, profit margins for small and medium-sized businesses will continue to shrink. EOS BOS Will the Conservatives stop hiding behind their ineffective voluntary code of conduct? EOS BOS Will they finally take the measures needed to fix this problem, which has been raised by merchant associations across the country? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact we heard the concerns of small business and introduced the code of conduct with the support of retailers, consumers and small business, and we have updated the code from time to time. EOS BOS It is working and is accomplishing the goals that were set by consumers, by small business and by the retailers. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations has joined the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and thousands of residential school survivors in calling for an official apology from the Catholic Church for the role that it played in this sad chapter of our history. EOS BOS The Prime Minister met with the Pope today. EOS BOS I have a simple question. EOS BOS Did he ask Pope Francis to apologize, yes or no? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs has written to the provinces, the territories, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and the Vatican to notify them of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report and recommendations. EOS BOS The Prime Minister also drew attention to the letter sent by the minister to the Holy See during his meeting with Pope Francis. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, many residential school survivors have said that an apology from the Pope would help them find closure and healing. EOS BOS They were hoping that the Prime Minister would raise the issue with the Pope during his meeting today. EOS BOS According to reports, the Prime Minister invited the Pope to visit Canada for its 150th celebration. EOS BOS When the Prime Minister extended that invitation, I would like to know if he also asked the Pope if he would be willing to issue an apology when he comes. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I just said, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development has written to the provinces, territories, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and the Vatican to inform them of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. EOS BOS The Prime Minister, when he met with the Pope today, also drew attention to that letter. EOS BOS We are taking action on the recommendations of the commission and are committed to a fair and lasting resolution of the legacy of the Indian residential schools. EOS BOS We will continue to move forward in the spirit of reconciliation between non-aboriginal and aboriginal Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on the weekend, thousands of people marched in Sorel to demonstrate their opposition to the unchecked use of the St. Lawrence River for exporting oil from the oil sands. EOS BOS They refuse to remain silent about the increased number of giant oil tankers on the river and refuse to accept the risk of an oil spill, which would be disastrous. EOS BOS Unfortunately, neither the NDP, the Liberals, nor the Conservatives were there to listen to what the elected officials, citizens, and groups had to say. EOS BOS When will the government acknowledge the concern caused by the oil being shipped on the St. Lawrence and listen to what people have to say? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government believes in responsible resource development and that is why we are signing so many free trade agreements. EOS BOS Part of that as well is being ready for the increase in traffic. EOS BOS That is why about a year ago we embarked upon the world-class tanker safety system. EOS BOS We have introduced a number of measures that do uphold the three pillars, which are to prevent a spill from happening, to respond if it does unfortunately happen and to ensure that taxpayer dollars are kept safe. EOS BOS Under prevention, we have one of the best smart navigation systems in the world and we will continue to invest in that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while Canadians wait for the budget, the Minister of Finance is actually cutting funds for his department's fiscal and economic analysis unit by more than a third. EOS BOS The minister has a history of making mistakes and introducing bad policy. EOS BOS There is his so-called small business job credit, which rewards firing workers. EOS BOS Then there is his $2 billion a year income splitting plan, which manages to be unfair, fiscally irresponsible and bad for growth. EOS BOS Why is the minister getting rid of the evidence that might prevent him from making more mistakes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is no mistake that we are giving families tax cuts and tax benefits. EOS BOS It is also no mistake, and Canadians know, that just as we are giving them those benefits, if the Liberals had the chance, they would end the income splitting for families, they would end income splitting for seniors. EOS BOS They are going to vote against the expanded and increased UCCB, so we know what they are going to do with that. EOS BOS We will continue to give money back to Canadian families, Canadian seniors, Canadian job creators. EOS BOS The Liberals can try to take it away and increase taxes. EOS BOS We will never do that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are more focused on advertising the budget than they are on writing it. EOS BOS Now they are spending $7.5 million tax dollars on budget ads this spring. EOS BOS Meanwhile, young Canadians are struggling to find summer jobs. EOS BOS A single ad during the hockey playoffs could help pay for more than 30 jobs in the Canada summer jobs program. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop wasting tax dollars to promote themselves and when will they start investing in summer jobs for Canadians and help young Canadians get the jobs they need? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians are always amused when the Liberal Party talks about government funding for advertising. EOS BOS We are still looking for the missing $40 million from over there. EOS BOS What our advertising will tell Canadians is that they are entitled to claim $1,000 for the children's fitness tax credit to help soccer moms and hockey dads, that they will get an increased universal child care benefit of almost $2,000 for kids under 6 and $720 for kids 6 through 17, and that income splitting for families and pensioners will put money directly into the pockets of the middle class. EOS BOS The Liberals do not want people to know about it because they would take that money away. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the problem with this government is that every time it opens its mouth, there is a big disconnect. EOS BOS As members will recall, they said they would make revenue-neutral tax changes. EOS BOS Instead, they have dug a $1.7-billion hole. EOS BOS Now, they are turning their attention to pensions. EOS BOS We are worried and we have every right to be worried. EOS BOS Can the government promise not to increase Canadians' CPP payroll taxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we want to have a pension plan that will allow Canadians to live their retirement years with dignity. EOS BOS That is why we want to enhance our pension plan. EOS BOS I am working with the provinces in order to help Canadians retire with dignity. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives like to thump their chests and brag about trade deals, despite the fact that under their watch, Canada has experienced unprecedented trade deficits 52 times. EOS BOS They just recorded the two worst monthly trade deficits in history. EOS BOS The current Conservative government continues to look for scapegoats for its incompetence, blaming others for its inability to close a deal. EOS BOS When will the Conservatives stop the blame game, get CETA properly finalized, and include the federal portion of the $400-million fund promised to Newfoundland and Labrador? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, no government has done more to advance Canada's trade interests than this Conservative government right here. EOS BOS Our government has concluded free trade agreements with 38 countries, with many more to come. EOS BOS Had the member actually reviewed the statistics, she would have found, if we factor in the recent decline in energy prices, that our exports are actually up 6.2% compared to last year. EOS BOS When the Liberals were in power, in 13 years they got three deals done, compared to our government, which since taking office has signed 38 free trade agreements. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is about to require $8 billion in cuts per year, twice as much as it anticipated in its economic statement presented just one month ago. EOS BOS At the same time, the Conservatives are going to spend $19 billion on prisons, $30 billion on fighter jets, and tens of millions of dollars on monarchist symbols and the commemoration of a forgotten war against the United States. EOS BOS Will the Minister of Finance get his priorities straight by making cuts in those areas and guarantee that service to the public and transfers to Quebec will not be affected? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this review is focusing on responsible government spending to ensure ongoing value for Canadian taxpayers. EOS BOS This review is also an opportunity to modernize how we do business. EOS BOS Canadians have trusted us to make responsible, reasonable and judicious decisions. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals claim that the $8.48 billion cut in this year's defence budget relates to the fixed-wing search and rescue and upgrades to the light armoured vehicles, but according to defence analyst David Perry, these two projects at most could account for $2.84 billion. EOS BOS Perry also says that finance officials cannot account for the $5.6 billion shortfall, so what other equipment does the Prime Minister plan on taking away? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that when it comes to flowing the money, it is making sure that we have the money in the appropriate years for the combat surface combatant, the fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft—the contract we signed—that we finally can have for our search and rescue technicians, and a laundry list of other equipment as well. EOS BOS This is about making sure we have the right money in the right years to pay for the full life-cycle costs of these projects.
               We are committed to the Canadian Armed Forces. EOS BOS We have a defence policy that is coming out shortly. EOS BOS I look forward to presenting that to this House and to the rest of Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada must pull its weight internationally. EOS BOS With this budget's $8.5-billion cut to military equipment spending, this is becoming less and less possible. EOS BOS The Liberals are not only putting at risk the livelihoods of tens of thousands of skilled industry workers, we are also pushing the schedules for our shipbuilding strategy further and further away. EOS BOS Canada has a long, proud military history. EOS BOS Why are the Liberals gutting our defence capabilities to pay for their out-of-control spending? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we have very good news for our men and women in uniform, including naval officers. EOS BOS Our government is committed to equipping the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard with the ships they need to serve Canadians. EOS BOS The strategy is a long-term commitment and will bring economic benefits to both coasts of our country, and indeed, to suppliers across this country. EOS BOS It will reinvigorate our marine industry, support Canadian innovation, and result in middle-class jobs for Canadians across the country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, another new story has come out about Phoenix. EOS BOS Apparently, the government was going to save taxpayers $688 million by using this new program, but as everyone knows, the opposite is true. EOS BOS The Phoenix fiasco has been dragging on for almost two years, and thousands of workers are still seeing no light at the end of the tunnel. EOS BOS Now that they are halfway through their term in office, will the Liberals stop blaming the Conservatives, do their job, and make sure that Phoenix works for all public servants? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that it is unacceptable that people are not being paid properly and promptly for the work they do. EOS BOS That is why we are working so hard to resolve this situation we inherited. EOS BOS We are working with the public service and the unions. EOS BOS Employees throughout the public service are working extremely hard with our government to resolve this problem as quickly as possible because it is unacceptable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in my region, problems at the border are a reality that cannot be ignored. EOS BOS Yet the Minister of Public Safety has announced $146 million in cuts to the Canada Border Services Agency. EOS BOS Some 260 jobs will be eliminated. EOS BOS There is already a network of smugglers at work, and several hundred immigrants have been the victims of human trafficking. EOS BOS This is not the time to be making cuts. EOS BOS Why is the minister not taking this seriously? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have said on numerous occasions, our government increased front-line officers by 26%, but while we were doing that, that member was voting against Bill C-31, the legislation that provides tools to address exactly the issue the member is now complaining about. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, once again, it is completely absurd and irresponsible for the minister to just bury his head in the sand. EOS BOS If smugglers are at work in Stanstead and human trafficking is a problem, how do we know that drugs and weapons are not also being smuggled in through that border crossing? EOS BOS What is the government hiding? EOS BOS The solution to this problem is not rocket science: the Canada Border Services Agency must be given the resources it needs, period. EOS BOS The problem already exists and now is not the time to be making cuts. EOS BOS Is the minister willing to work with us to come up with solutions, to come and see the extent of the damage for himself and to work with the community? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we do know that it is not the NDP that is preventing any of that, whether it is drug trafficking, human trafficking or guns. EOS BOS That party voted consistently against all of the measures, including Bill C-31, that this government has taken in order to stop those measures. EOS BOS The member can go back to his constituents and tell them that he sat down on the job when he should have been standing up and voting with us on Bill C-31. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the Prime Minister another question, this one from Monique in Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix. EOS BOS Monique would like to know how the government can justify spending Canadians' money on negative partisan advertising. EOS BOS She does not think that is productive for anyone, except the Conservative Party, and she thinks that there are many other causes that would be worthy of her tax money and that would help Canadians. EOS BOS She wants to know why the Prime Minister is wasting her tax dollars on negative partisan advertising. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank Monique for her question EOS BOS .I will say that advertising is an essential means for informing Canadians about important issues, such as temporary stimulus measures, tax credits and public health issues. EOS BOS [English]I would say, of course, that our rates of advertising are much lower than those of the previous Liberal government, and we will continue to do so to make sure that the taxpayer is defended. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada on the Indian residential school system will be released tomorrow. EOS BOS The testimony of more than 7,000 people was heard. EOS BOS There are thousands of stories about children being taken from their families and forced to deny their culture and language. EOS BOS Many of them were physically and sexually abused. EOS BOS This is a veritable tragedy and a blot on Canada's history. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister seize this opportunity and finally answer the call of our first nations? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the record will show that in 2008, on behalf of all Canadians, the Prime Minister apologized to all survivors, their families and the communities affected by this dark chapter in Canadian history. EOS BOS We know that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is finishing its work this week, and it is important for all Canadians to continue supporting reconciliation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Commissioner Murray Sinclair was clear: “...it takes more than words. EOS BOS In addition to the apology, there has to be atonement and there has to be action”.First nations have been dismayed by the government's failure to embrace reconciliation. EOS BOS The Truth and Reconciliation Commission had to go to court to get key documents released. EOS BOS Victims have been denied compensation or treated with suspicion and hostility. EOS BOS Will the government change its attitude and work with first nations to achieve reconciliation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when the Prime Minister made an historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008, the government recognized that the Indian residential schools caused great harm and had no place in Canada. EOS BOS While we cannot undo the past, we can learn from it, and we are taking steps necessary to bring closure to the legacy of the Indian residential schools. EOS BOS We encourage all Canadians to continue promoting reconciliation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the reality is that since the 2008 apology, little has changed for indigenous people. EOS BOS The legacy of residential schools is still present today in high rates of poverty and unemployment, in the high number of children in foster care, and the unacceptably high number of missing and murdered indigenous women. EOS BOS If the government is serious about reconciliation, it will have to do a lot more to show it. EOS BOS Will the government commit to honouring the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we welcome the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and we thank the commissioners for their hard work in uncovering and documenting the truth about residential schools in Canada. EOS BOS We look forward to receiving a full report to be able to fully understand and respond to the recommendations. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government's record following the apology does not give a lot of hope. EOS BOS According to National Chief Bellegarde, “ EOS BOS The relationship has not improved to the point where we can say reconciliation has started”.Last year, the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars fighting aboriginal and treaty rights. EOS BOS That is not how to build a relationship. EOS BOS Will the government work with aboriginal peoples to build a new relationship that is founded on respect and reconciliation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, our government remains committed to a fair and lasting resolution to the legacy of Indian residential schools. EOS BOS As acknowledged by the Prime Minister on behalf of all Canadians in 2008, there is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential school system to ever prevail again. EOS BOS While this is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's closing event, the work to heal the relationship between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians needs to continue. EOS BOS The government will continue to fulfill its obligations as set out in the agreement. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government must take this opportunity to take a serious look at its chronic failure to act. EOS BOS Some 20 years after the last residential school closed, education programs for first nations children are receiving less money than those for other children. EOS BOS The same goes for health care and social services. EOS BOS There can be no reconciliation when we are constantly being treated as second-class citizens. EOS BOS Will the government ever do something to ensure that every child has the same chance for success? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I believe that the report will show that we have made a significant effort to improve the situation for first nations members and aboriginal people across Canada. EOS BOS In fact, not so long ago, in the budget before this one, we proposed a major investment to ensure that first nations children had the same degree of education and services as other Canadians. EOS BOS Unfortunately, for reasons beyond our control, we were unable to move forward with this initiative, but we are continuing to work with first nations on improving the situation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release the long-anticipated report of its important work. EOS BOS Canadians will learn a great deal about the truth of this dark chapter in Canadian history. EOS BOS However, essential work lies ahead in order to achieve genuine reconciliation. EOS BOS Would the government commit to following up on the symbolism of the apology with concrete actions to facilitate real healing for the survivors and their families, and to engaging all Canadians in the real work of reconciliation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I indicated earlier, we welcome the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. EOS BOS We thank the commissioners and the survivors who came forward to tell their stories because it was time that all Canadians know the truth about that sad legacy of Canada. EOS BOS The government remains committed to working with first nations, all aboriginal peoples across Canada, to address the challenges that we all inherited as a people living in Canada on account of that history. EOS BOS What is important is working in partnership in the future. EOS BOS That is what we are committed to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I do not want to pre-empt what the government will be enlightening us on, but I understand that we will possibly be debating the Paris accord next week, which we welcome. EOS BOS We hope that the government will pay that same important attention if the Liberals decide to send Canadian men and women into harm's way and will take its time on those important decisions. EOS BOS With that in mind, I want to ask the hon. EOS BOS House leader what the government is proposing for the rest of this week and for next week. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we will continue to debate the NDP opposition motion. EOS BOS Tomorrow we will resume debate on Bill C-22, on the national security committee of parliamentarians. EOS BOS [English]I understand that tomorrow will be the final day of debate at second reading. EOS BOS I thank the opposition for their co-operation on this matter. EOS BOS Next week we will debate a motion for the ratification of the Paris Agreement. EOS BOS As my colleague mentioned, I anticipate a very robust debate, as there is much interest by hon. EOS BOS members on all sides. EOS BOS I am working with the other House leaders to complete the debate with a vote on Wednesday. EOS BOS Pursuant to Standing Order 51, the House will have a debate regarding the Standing Orders and procedures next Thursday. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, may I remind the minister that the first thing the government did was to create a huge deficit? EOS BOS With no plan to return to zero deficit in this country, this is totally unacceptable. EOS BOS [Translation]
              If the government really wants to be nice to Canadian taxpayers, could it tell them the truth for once? EOS BOS This government was elected by promising small deficits and a balanced budget in 2019. EOS BOS Could the government tell us when Canada will have a balanced budget? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that my colleague from Louis-Saint-Laurent is asking me a question. EOS BOS The first thing we did was cut taxes for the middle class. EOS BOS The reality is that nine million Canadians pays less taxes. EOS BOS In my colleague's riding, in the Quebec City region, thousands of people are paying less tax thanks to our government. EOS BOS In 2016, we invested in families, the economy, and infrastructure. EOS BOS In 2017, we invested in training and innovation. EOS BOS That is exactly what responsible governments do; they invest in their people. EOS BOS That is what we have done and what we will continue to do. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, like me, you listened closely to the minister's reply and, like me, you noted that the government cannot tell Canadians when it will balance the budget. EOS BOS That is unacceptable. EOS BOS The Liberals have no plan for balancing the budget and they are doing very little, if anything, for farmers, those people who feed us and who feed all Canadians. EOS BOS Agriculture is not mentioned in the government's budget document until page 107. EOS BOS Why has the government turned its back on those who feed Canadians? EOS BOS Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS </s> BOS Order, please. I know members, including the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, are very engaged in this discussion, but I would ask them to restrain themselves until they have the floor. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have been in the House a long time and to be able to present as Minister of Agriculture the type of budget our Minister of Finance presented to the House is certainly a credit to our agricultural sector and certainly gives me great pride. EOS BOS There is $950 million to enhance Canada's global competitiveness by focusing on industry, $200 million for clean technology, and $1.26 billion for innovation. EOS BOS What this government has done is made sure that our— EOS </s> BOS The hon. member for Nanaimo—Ladysmith. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the Minister of National Defence said, his limo ride on a search and rescue helicopter was not a demonstration. EOS BOS The military says that it only did it at the minister's request. EOS BOS He was lifted from his friend's fishing lodge in a basket. EOS BOS Our troops crossed their fingers and hoped the helicopter would not be needed to respond to an actual emergency. EOS BOS Either the Minister of National Defence is saying that the military is lying or he is misleading this House. EOS BOS Which is it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as has been said many times, the Minister of National Defence left personal time to return to work early. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence paid for his air travel to and from his personal vacation and used government aircraft only when called away on government business. EOS BOS The policy for the Prime Minister and ministers requires that commercial travel be utilized for public business, with government aircraft being used when commercial travel is not available or is not compatible with security requirements. EOS BOS Our government has reduced average annual spending on ministers' Challenger flights by over 80% compared to the previous Liberal government. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence can go ahead and keep saying the same thing, but when he is contradicted by other reports he will have to change his talking points. EOS BOS We now know that he was collected from an isolated fishing lodge in Newfoundland under the pretext of an imaginary rescue operation. EOS BOS We could say that the minister's story is nautical miles from reality. EOS BOS Will he admit his mistake and apologize for using a Canadian Forces search and rescue helicopter for personal reasons? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, this is all about piling it on. EOS BOS All of these issues have already been addressed many times by the Minister of National Defence. EOS BOS There is no point in repeating the same response which is that he used the aircraft while on vacation to fulfill requirements to do with his job. EOS BOS How much more does the member need to know than what has already been said? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Mary Ng, the Liberal candidate in Markham—Thornhill and former director of appointments to the Prime Minister, bragged she was responsible for the appointment of members of the Immigration and Refugee Board. EOS BOS The Prime Minister's hand-picked candidate is undermining the confidence in the board. EOS BOS Could the Prime Minister ensure that the integrity of the Immigration and Refugee Board has not been compromised as a result of Mary Ng's political ambitions? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member will be proud to know that this government has introduced a new government-wide appointments process that is open, transparent, and merit-based. EOS BOS Our approach will actually result in the recommendation of highly qualified candidates who achieve gender parity and truly reflect Canada's diversity. EOS BOS All opportunities to apply are available online, and I encourage Canadians to apply. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know the Minister of Finance owns $32 million in shares in Morneau Shepell. EOS BOS His ethics filings show they are held in a numbered company. EOS BOS The minister lives in Toronto, Morneau Shepell is headquartered in Toronto, but the numbered company is located in Alberta. EOS BOS Do any of the Minister of Finance's tax changes stop people from registering their assets in a place they do not live in order to pay less tax than everyone else? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we know our tax system encourages wealthy Canadians to incorporate so they pay a lower rate of tax than middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS We have identified that this is important for us to look at to make sure our system is fair. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing. EOS BOS We know that to do this, we need to listen to Canadians and understand the consequences to make sure we get it right. EOS BOS That is exactly what we are doing. EOS BOS Our consultation period is intended to listen to Canadians so we can end up with a tax system that is fair for all Canadians, today and tomorrow. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Morneau Shepell is located in Ontario and the Minister of Finance lives in Ontario. EOS BOS However, his numbered company that holds his $32 million in Morneau Shepell shares is located in Alberta. EOS BOS Is there anything in the Minister of Finance's tax plan that would prevent a resident of Ontario from registering a corporation in another province for the purpose of sheltering a family fortune from higher taxes? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, again, we want to make sure that we are very clear on our objectives. EOS BOS We want to make sure we have a system that is fair to all Canadians. EOS BOS We know that right now there are incentives that encourage wealthy Canadians to incorporate to have a lower rate of tax than other Canadians. EOS BOS That is something we need to deal with. EOS BOS To do that, we need to make sure we get it right. EOS BOS We have been consulting with experts for a year. EOS BOS We have been listening to Canadians to make sure we end up with a tax system that is fair. EOS
BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I want to point for some members who insist on heckling when someone else is speaking that they may be putting their own side in danger of losing a question. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Beauce. EOS </s> BOS So, Mr. Speaker, no answer.
              [Translation] EOS BOS The Liberals think that their tax penalty plan will affect just a small  number of business people in Canda, but that is not true. EOS BOS Why is the Minister of Finance insisting on imposing a tax system on St-Georges Toyota, in Beauce, which will have to pay a 73% tax, when the Prime Minister's family fortune and the finance minister's family business will not be affected? EOS BOS When will the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance finally start respecting small businesses in Canada? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have a clear answer. EOS BOS We currently have a system that encourages the wealthy to incorporate in order to pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. EOS BOS The facts are clear. EOS BOS We also have a situation where small and medium-sized businesses have the lowest tax rate in the G7. EOS BOS That is very important for the future and for investment. EOS BOS At the same time, the system has to be fair. EOS </s> BOS What is clear, Mr. Speaker, is that there is one rule for the Minister of Finance and another rule for everyone else, one rule for big business and one rule for small businesses. EOS BOS The government is overtaxing small businesses, overtaxing mechanics, overtaxing corner store owners. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS To have more revenue to fix a deficit that the Liberals themselves created. EOS BOS The solution is very simple: reduce expenditures and provide a fair system for all the country's entrepreneurs. EOS
BOS I must ask the hon. member for Bellechasse— EOS BOS Les Etchemins—Lévis not to bang his desk. EOS BOS He knows that it is not acceptable in the House, and I would prefer that he not do it in the future. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have often said, we feel that is very important to make investments. EOS BOS Our decision is to invest in our country. EOS BOS We began with investments in infrastructure. EOS BOS Now, the report is clear: we have a higher rate of growth than 10 years ago. EOS BOS We have created almost 400,000 more jobs than last year. EOS BOS Our program is working, and that is very important to Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have heard loud and clear from the people of Abbotsford, including those in the Liberal riding of Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon. EOS BOS They are angry as hornets over these terrible tax proposals. EOS BOS Blueberry farmers, entrepreneurs, and small business owners are up in arms. EOS BOS In 12 years as a parliamentarian, I have never seen such outrage, and that outrage grew when they found out that the Prime Minister's and the finance minister's own family fortunes will not be touched by the tax. EOS BOS You tell me, how is that fair? EOS </s> BOS I hope my hon. friend has not started asking me questions. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Finance. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we know that Canadians want to have a tax system that is fair. EOS BOS We know they want the rules to apply to everyone. EOS BOS That is why we are putting forth rules that will ensure the richest among us do not have an incentive to lower their tax rate through a private corporation, paying a lower rate of tax than middle-class Canadians, and so we are looking toward putting in place a system that will ensure the system is fair for all Canadians. EOS BOS That is why we are listening to Canadians' points of view from across the country. EOS BOS That is important, but what we are going to do is move forward to make sure our system creates incentives and is fair for all Canadians. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Tyler and Jody from Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, started their own small business 15 years ago at the age of 26. EOS BOS He told me, “ EOS BOS At 41 years old, we just now started again putting money away.... EOS BOS Our life savings is our company....” EOS BOS He cannot imagine why the minister would attack his business and his retirement savings with a 73% tax while protecting the family fortune of the Prime Minister and the minister's own personal family business. EOS BOS How is this fair? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are looking toward making sure our system is fair. EOS BOS We are looking toward making sure we do not encourage wealthy Canadians to set up a private corporation so they can pay a lower rate of tax than middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS We do not want people to be spreading misinformation. EOS BOS The facts are clear. EOS BOS Our low small business tax rate is important. EOS BOS We believe that should be continued. EOS BOS That will allow small businesses across the country to invest in their business to grow the economy. EOS BOS We are going to continue that to make sure that works while also ensuring that this generation, and the next generation, has a tax system that is fair. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is now clear to everyone watching that the Liberals have totally screwed up their small business tax plan. EOS BOS How do we know this? EOS BOS It is because even Liberal MPs are admitting that the Liberals have totally screwed up their small business tax plan. EOS BOS Why will the finance minister not take up the proposal from New Democrats and from small business owners to expand the review to include all big businesses and to extend the consultations so everyone is heard? EOS BOS Let us all now watch the finance minister get up and try to defend his botched plan, or maybe he will finally tell Canadians why he is so gosh-darned determined to protect his wealthy and well-connected friends. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share and the middle class have a fair tax rate is something we have been on for the last two years. EOS BOS We have lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the one per cent. EOS BOS We have introduced the Canada child benefit and put a billion dollars in the Canada Revenue Agency. EOS BOS Now we are looking toward closing tax advantages for wealthy Canadians. EOS BOS My question for the member opposite is why has his party not supported any of these measures that are helping the middle class. EOS BOS Why is his party sitting on the sidelines as we are making a real difference for Canadians today and tomorrow? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, only a Liberal could ignore the biggest abuse in our tax system and call it fairness. EOS BOS [Translation]
              Mr. Speaker, have you ever seen an iceberg? EOS BOS They are as impressive as they are deceptive. EOS BOS In fact, they are exactly like the Liberals' tax reform. EOS BOS If the Minister of Finance were serious, he would keep his promise to abolish the loophole for CEOs, which is costing us $750 million, and then he would go after tax havens, which are costing us billions of dollars. EOS BOS Could the minister's red herring be a way for him to appear progressive while still protecting his friends on Bay Street? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians expect a fair tax system. EOS BOS That is what we promised during the election campaign and that is what we are doing. EOS BOS In the last two budgets, we invested over $1 billion in the fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS Those investments are bearing fruit: $13 billion in taxes owed last year will be recovered, and 335 cases are under criminal investigation, not to mention 123 search warrants, 37 convictions, $10 million in fines, $44 million in penalties— EOS </s> BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Mégantic—L'Érable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government promised to run a small $10-billion deficit, but now it is almost double that and there is no end in sight. EOS BOS The Compton family has had a family farm on Prince Edward Island for over 100 years. EOS BOS Three generations have invested everything they have in that farm. EOS BOS Today, the Minister of Finance wants to pick their pockets in order to pay off the huge deficit. EOS BOS He is jeopardizing the transfer of the farm to the next generation. EOS BOS Why is the Minister of Finance coming up with a system where the Compton family would pay 73% in tax, while the Prime Minister's family fortune and the Minister of Finance's family business will not be affected? EOS BOS [English] EOS BOS How is that fair? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it is very important to have a fair system. EOS BOS We want to establish a program that does not encourage the wealthy to incorporate in order to pay a lower tax rate and that also sets a very low tax rate for small and medium-sized businesses. EOS BOS That is very important. EOS BOS Our investments are very important for the economy, for farmers, and for all Canadians because we are currently experiencing the highest growth rate in a decade. EOS BOS That is very important for SMEs, farmers, and all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Roy and Ross Newman are farmers in Alberta. They were hoping to pass on their family farm to their sons who would be the fifth generation of Newmans working their land near High River, but they are very concerned about the Liberal tax changes. EOS BOS In fact, tax experts across the country agree. EOS BOS These changes could wipe out the family farm. EOS BOS Why has the finance minister designed a system that protects his own family fortune and the family fortune of the Prime Minister, but could mean this generation of Newmans is the last on their family farm? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I know that farmers, other small business people, and Canadians across the country want to make sure their tax system is fair, not only for them, but for their families. EOS BOS They want to make sure it is not a system that encourages people to do tax planning so they will have a lower tax rate than middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS That is what we are working toward. EOS BOS In the case of farmers, we know we want to listen to make sure our tax proposals, which are important to make the system fair, do not have unintended consequences. EOS BOS That is why we are listening to farmers across this country. EOS BOS We know how important they are. EOS BOS We are going to listen to them and we are going to get this right. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I have not had one farmer or rancher call me in support of these tax changes; that is thousands. EOS BOS The Hochstein family in my riding are farmers. EOS BOS They have been working the land for four generations. EOS BOS They budget tightly to ensure that their operation can stay afloat, but they are very concerned that the Liberals cannot manage their out-of-control spending and they are coming for their farm to pay for it. EOS BOS Why would the finance minister design a system where the Hochstein family has to pay 73% tax, whereas the family fortunes of the Prime Minister and the finance minister are untouched? EOS BOS How is that fair? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a good economy helps all Canadians. EOS BOS A fair tax system helps all Canadians. EOS BOS We are working to achieve both. EOS BOS We are making investments in our economy, but we are making sure that we do not have a tax system that encourages the wealthiest to incorporate to have a lower tax rate. EOS BOS That is really important. EOS BOS What we will see through the changes that we are putting forward is that, over the long term, farms and small businesses will be better off with a fairer tax system and a strong economy. EOS BOS That will help them and that will help the next generation. EOS BOS We are going to make sure that happens. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, here are the facts. EOS BOS The Prime Minister thinks that small business owners are tax cheats, so it is easy for him and the finance minister to demonize them and create a system whereby they are paying 73% tax while companies and family fortunes like those of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are sheltered. EOS BOS It is not fair. EOS BOS We all know that. EOS BOS When will the Liberals abandon this cowardly and self-serving plan and stand up and do something for small business owners in this country? EOS </s> BOS Actually, Mr. Speaker, here are the facts. EOS BOS We now have a situation where people who are wealthy are encouraged to go to incorporation in order to lower their tax rate—
              
                Some hon. EOS BOS members: EOS BOS Oh, oh! EOS
BOS Order. I am having trouble hearing the answer from the hon. EOS BOS Minister of Finance. EOS BOS I need to hear the answer in case he breaks any rules, so I am aware of that EOS BOS . I would ask members to try to restrain themselves and to hear the answer whether they like it or not, because that is what we do here. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of Finance. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we believe it is important not to spread misinformation. EOS BOS What is really important is to make sure we observe what is going on right now, which is a system that encourages the wealthiest to incorporate to pay a lower rate of tax. EOS BOS What we have right now also is a system where small and medium-sized businesses pay the lowest rate of tax among G7 countries. EOS BOS That is important. EOS BOS We want to maintain that because we want to allow them to continue to invest in their businesses and our economy. EOS BOS We will go forward to make sure that is the case, and at the same time we will make sure our tax system works for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General has expressed concern over the significant weaknesses in Canada's oversight of its railways. EOS BOS The very purpose of any government is to guarantee public safety. EOS BOS In light of the events in Lac-Mégantic and the Auditor General's report, we see that the Conservatives have failed miserably at protecting the public when it comes to rail safety. EOS BOS When will they protect the public instead of private companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. EOS BOS The Auditor General notes that we have a system that works most of the time. EOS BOS In fact, accidents are on the decline in Canada. EOS BOS The Auditor General also notes that our government has made new investments since coming into power. EOS BOS However, he made some important recommendations that the government will accept and act on. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I was overjoyed to learn that Abby and Dominic Maryk were reunited with their mother and returned to Winnipeg after being abducted by their father and taken to Mexico four years ago. EOS BOS It has been a complex and sad case, but one with a happy ending. EOS BOS Could the Minister of State responsible for Consular Affairs please update the House on this case? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the excellent support she has provided to these constituents. EOS BOS The Maryk children did indeed return to Winnipeg yesterday with their mother. EOS BOS It was a coordinated effort. EOS BOS I sincerely thank consular officials, our partners in Mexico, the Province of Manitoba, the RCMP and the CBSA for their hard work in locating and returning these children. EOS BOS I hope the mother and her children can now rebuild their family life and that those responsible for this abduction will be held responsible. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, every time I ask a question about pyrrhotite, which is destroying thousands of homes in Trois-Rivières, the Conservative government refuses to take responsibility. EOS BOS Every time the government tells me to talk to the Government of Quebec. EOS BOS A recent court ruling—specifically about the CSA A23.1 standard, which determines the amount of pyrrhotite that can be contained in concrete before causing a disaster—contradicts the Conservatives' argument. EOS BOS That is a federal standard. EOS BOS I repeat: that is a federal standard. EOS BOS Will the government commit to amending the federal CSA A23.1 standard to protect the public? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the use of pyrrhotite is a provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS It is up to the provincial government to resolve. EOS BOS In this case, it is Quebec that needs to resolve this issue for Quebeckers. EOS BOS This is not a federal jurisdiction. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, no one uses pyrrhotite, since it can cause concrete cancer. EOS BOS The government said that it would help victims, but, based on what it is telling us now, we can see that that was a joke. EOS BOS Pyrrhotite victims are demanding answers. EOS BOS It is our duty to prevent any further victims in Trois-Rivières or elsewhere in Canada. EOS BOS Can the Conservatives explain how the federal standard that regulates the tolerances of concrete structures can be a provincial jurisdiction? EOS BOS Will they continue to make up excuses to avoid helping pyrrhotite victims back home? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, unfortunately for the member, his question about the use of pyrrhotite is a provincial jurisdiction. EOS BOS The provincial governments, including the Government of Quebec, are responsible for this issue. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it has been over five years since the Conservatives promised to give back the surplus land that was expropriated by Transport Canada to build Mirabel airport. EOS BOS This was supposed to be resolved back in December. EOS BOS Several files are still dragging on and the farmers fear that not all 11,000 acres of land will be given back. EOS BOS Will the government act quickly to give back all 11,000 acres to the farmers of Mirabel? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the airport was built in the early 1980s, and it took until 2006 for a former transport minister in this government to initiate the process to return the land. EOS BOS Thus, it took over 20 years to begin the process. EOS BOS The process is proceeding normally, and our team in the cabinet, in the department, continues to work hard on this file. EOS BOS Of course, much like the land owners, we would prefer this to move more quickly. EOS BOS We are working hard on this and we will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadian students are out there looking for summer work, and they cannot find it. EOS BOS The youth employment rate today is six points worse than it was five years ago. EOS BOS In fact, last year's summer job numbers were the worst since Stats Canada started tracking the data in the 1970s. EOS BOS With so many more young Canadians desperately looking for work this summer, why have the Conservatives cut by half the Canada summer jobs program? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in fact, in the very first economic action plan we increased the amount of funds available to the Canada summer jobs program, and two years ago we made that increase permanent. EOS BOS We want to help young Canadians get the experience they need for future jobs but also earn money to help them pay for post-secondary education. EOS BOS This summer, some 36,000 students will benefit from the Canada summer jobs program, but in our budget 2013 we have also added funding for some several thousand internships to help students get the experience they need. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister just boasted about 36,000 summer jobs for students. EOS BOS The fact is that back in 2006 that program created 113,000 summer jobs. EOS BOS Government support has gone down, according to the minister's own figures. EOS BOS Government support for summer jobs has gone down under the government. EOS BOS Youth employment numbers are, again, six points worse than they were five years ago. EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives cutting in half the summer jobs program when the situation is so much worse? EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives throwing a generation of young Canadians under the bus? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member's numbers are totally and completely wrong. EOS BOS The fact is that some 36,000 jobs will be created through the Canada summer jobs programs, but there are other programs within the government that will help young people get experience and get the funding they need for university. EOS BOS It is so important that we help them get both of those things for their future career success. EOS BOS That is why there will be an extra several thousand internships available through the career skills program. EOS BOS If the Liberals are sincere in their desire to help young people, they should support the budget that has these efforts in it. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we cannot support the budget because it offers less, not more, than in 2006 to support youth summer jobs. EOS BOS The minister did not answer the question. EOS BOS The problem now is that TD Economics estimates that high youth unemployment and low salaries will cost this generation of young Canadians, now at the beginning of their careers, some $23 billion. EOS BOS You heard correctly, $23 billion. EOS BOS With our aging population and the challenges that will bring, why are the Conservatives abandoning the Canada of tomorrow? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are helping young Canadians prepare for and find jobs. EOS BOS In fact, the apprenticeship grants we introduced are just one example. EOS BOS Some 400,000 of these grants have gone to young Canadians to help them get the skills they need to work in skilled trades. EOS BOS This measure is very important to them and to our country. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, two months ago we heard shocking revelations about the extent of sexual assault in the military. EOS BOS The minister promised a review, but only dealing with policies and procedures. EOS BOS The internal review is now out, and it claims “ EOS BOS There are no assessed gaps in policy”. EOS BOS Every day five individuals in the Canadian military are victims of sexual assault. EOS BOS Could the minister explain how that can leave him satisfied with current policy? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, any allegations of sexual harassment in the armed forces are truly disturbing. EOS BOS This is why the Chief of the Defence Staff is conducting an external review, not the internal review that the hon. EOS BOS member just referred to. EOS BOS I look forward to that review, because this kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister keeps saying he takes this seriously, but he talks about sexual harassment, not sexual assault. EOS BOS It has been two months since we have had these revelations, yet the military's internal review says no serious changes are needed. EOS BOS It hardly even mentions the subject of criminal sexual assault. EOS BOS What could be a better sign that an independent review is necessary?Would the minister now agree that we need a truly independent inquiry, led by someone who is not hand-picked by the military brass and supported by independent counsel? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, that member has no confidence in the military leadership of this country. EOS BOS He missed the point again. EOS BOS An external review is being conducted for this unspeakable and unacceptable kind of behaviour. EOS BOS He should get onside with us. EOS BOS We are the ones who stand up for victims of sexual assault in this country. EOS BOS That is our record, and I am proud of that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, even though an estimated one-third of women in the Canadian Armed Forces have been sexually harassed, an internal report concluded that a significant overhaul is not necessary because, it says, harassment rates are falling and the existing administrative policies are just fine. EOS BOS Seriously. EOS BOS When the senior ranks of the Canadian Forces continue to deny that the army has a sexual harassment problem, how are victims, citizens and military personnel supposed to believe that anything will be done to address the situation? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the senior ranks are not denying the problem. EOS BOS As I pointed out to the member's colleague, an external review is being conducted on the orders of the Chief of the Defence Staff. EOS BOS We look forward to that report, because this is a priority for this government and for the military. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the minister is making a mistake by asking the Canadian Forces to investigate their own problems. EOS BOS I do not understand what he does not get about this issue. EOS BOS The internal report clearly shows that the senior ranks are downplaying the sexual harassment problem. EOS BOS They are more interested in managing their own image than in finding solutions. EOS BOS Contrary to their claims, harassment in the army is a serious and widespread problem that demands a comprehensive independent inquiry. EOS BOS How can the minister suggest that the recently announced review will be independent, considering that the senior ranks will choose who is going to be in charge of it? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the hon. EOS BOS member is not listening to what has taken place. EOS BOS There was an internal review, as I indicated, but the Chief of the Defence Staff is conducting an external independent review of these serious charges. EOS BOS The member should pay attention to that. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as the Liberals dither, the Prime Minister has even gone so far as to dismiss the safety concerns of our border communities, calling those asking for his help “fearful and closed in.” EOS BOS This is precisely the arrogant attitude that is frustrating so many Canadians, and it is why the Prime Minister needs to actually talk to those on the front lines of this crisis. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister commit right now to visiting Emerson to speak directly with the families impacted by his inaction? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, some weeks ago, it was my privilege to visit Emerson. EOS BOS I had the opportunity to meet with the reeve and the council. EOS BOS I had the opportunity to meet with many of the citizens there. EOS BOS I noticed that members of the opposition paid a visit last week. EOS BOS It is interesting that a good many of the citizens of that community challenged the opposition members for the kind of attitude that they were displaying on this issue. EOS BOS It is important to respect Canadian law. EOS BOS It is being enforced in every way. EOS BOS It is also important to honour Canada's international obligations in the proper treatment of asylum seekers. EOS BOS We are applying both in a measured way. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians thought that the Liberals were going to change the marijuana laws as soon as they came to power. EOS BOS Why did everyone think that? EOS BOS It is because it was clearly stated in their election platform and because the Prime Minister said so himself about 100 times. EOS BOS Since the campaign, however, the Liberals have encouraged the police to continue arresting Canadians for simple possession of marijuana. EOS BOS Why would the government rather give tens of thousands of Canadians criminal records instead of decriminalizing marijuana now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as we have said all along, and we have been consistent, we are committed to legalization, restricting access, and strictly regulating marijuana to achieve the ultimate objective of keeping it out of the hands of kids, and the proceeds out of the hands of criminals. EOS BOS As my friend across the way has indicated in the past, it would be a mistake just to decriminalize because to simply decriminalize would not achieve those objectives. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, actually, decriminalizing would make sure that young people do not drag criminal records with them for the rest of their lives when we are about to legalize. EOS BOS The government has just created massive confusion in the justice system. EOS BOS Judges are calling the situation absurd. EOS BOS While the government is talking legalization, the courts are being forced to convict. EOS BOS Even the Conservative Party now calls for marijuana possession to be removed from the Criminal Code. EOS BOS Why will the Liberal government continue to hand out criminal records to tens of thousands of mostly young Canadians instead of decriminalizing marijuana now? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to the legalization and strict regulation of marijuana. EOS BOS Simply decriminalizing will not achieve the objectives of keeping it out of the hands of children and keeping the proceeds out of the hands of criminals. EOS BOS We have committed to introduce legislation in the spring of 2017. EOS BOS In that intervening period, we will engage with experts in the health area, public safety, justice, and law enforcement to ensure that we proceed in an orderly manner that will achieve the objectives we are committed to achieving. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, “transparency”, “openness”, and “integrity” are words the Liberals opposite keep bandying about, but they never walk the talk. EOS BOS The first officer of Parliament appointment is a partisan one. EOS BOS Donating to Liberal Party coffers or helping our famous Prime Minister during his election campaign is a path to becoming the commissioner of official languages. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister put partisanship aside and protect official languages ahead of his personal interests? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, both our official languages are an important part of our history and our Canadian identity and they are important to us. EOS BOS As far as appointments are concerned, our government is firmly committed to having a strong, open, and transparent appointment process and finding the best candidate for each position. EOS BOS The role of commissioner of official languages is very important and we are sure that the person recommended will have all the required qualifications. EOS BOS An announcement will be made in due course. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we have learned that the Prime Minister plans to appoint a recently retired provincial Liberal minister as the new official languages watchdog. EOS BOS The Prime Minister promised a new appointments process and, while this is certainly new, appointing a clear partisan to be an officer of Parliament, an officer of this place, is unprecedented. EOS BOS Will the Prime Minister withdraw this nomination before he completely undermines the impartiality and the independence of the Commissioner of Official Languages? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I am happy to provide the same response in our second official language, English. EOS BOS Our two official languages are at the heart of who we are as Canadians. EOS BOS Our government is firmly committed to a rigorous, open, and transparent process for all public appointments. EOS BOS The Commissioner of Official Languages is a critically important role. EOS BOS We will ensure that the recommended person is highly qualified. EOS BOS Our announcement will be made in due course. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, rail in Canada has reached a state of crisis. EOS BOS The government has no rail strategy. EOS BOS Service and safety and Canadians suffer. EOS BOS VIA rail trains are forced onto the sidings, while dangerous goods just roar past. EOS BOS Does the minister agree with former Conservative prime minister Robert Borden, who called for the nationalization of Canada's key strategic rail beds? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the former prime minister Borden of course being a Nova Scotian, it would be tempting to agree with him. EOS BOS However, that being said, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate what our government has done on the issue of rail safety. EOS BOS We have increased the number of inspectors. EOS BOS We have invested $100 million into ensuring that our goods can travel safely and securely. EOS BOS With the full support of the Canadian public, we are working hard on the matter and will continue to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, while the NDP members continue to bend and twist Canada's rich military history to suit their far left leanings, our government is committed to commemorating Canadian veterans and their accomplishments. EOS BOS In January our government proudly marked 2013 as the Year of the Korean War Veteran, and today the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the Minister of National Defence made yet another great announcement. EOS BOS Would the Minister of Veterans Affairs please update this House on how we are continuing to recognize Canada's great accomplishments during the Korean War? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the member for Don Valley West is right. They were young and reckless. EOS BOS Along with more than 15 countries with the United Nations 60 years ago, they fought in Korea for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law against communism. EOS BOS Today, the Minister of National Defence and I presented a certificate of recognition to our great Canadian Korean War veterans to show our deepest gratitude and recognition for their many sacrifices.
							[Translation]I thank our Korean War veterans. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, when the Minister of Finance announced his tax increases on small businesses and family farmers over the summer, he was meticulous in sheltering his assets from any higher taxes. EOS BOS If we only knew what holdings he had, we would know what taxes he will not raise. EOS BOS However, we do not know what holdings he has because he is hiding them in a myriad of numbered companies. EOS BOS Will the finance minister tell us what holdings he is hiding in these numbered companies, so Canadians can surmise the small list of taxes that he will not raise? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to assure my hon. EOS BOS colleague that the Minister of Finance has always done what all MPs do, by working with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to make sure he is always fully transparent with her and follows the rules. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance has always followed the Ethics Commissioner's recommendations, and he announced that he would go even further to make sure he can continue the important work he does for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we could all have a little more confidence in the truth of that statement if the finance minister would just come clean about the holdings he is sheltering in his vast network of numbered companies and trust funds. EOS BOS It took investigative journalists to find out that he was hiding $20 million of holdings in Morneau Shepell, a financial company that he regulates, and a financial company on which he very carefully avoided imposing any new taxes. EOS BOS Will the finance minister tell Canadians what holdings he is hiding in his numbered companies and trust funds, so they can know that he is acting in their interest and not his own? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, acting in the interests of Canadians was lowering taxes for nine million Canadians, lowering taxes for small businesses from 10.5% to 9%, helping 300,000 kids be lifted out of poverty with the Canada child benefit, and growing this economy at the fastest pace in the G7, something the Conservatives were never able to achieve. EOS BOS That is working in the interests of Canadians. EOS BOS That is Conservatives playing politics. EOS BOS That is Liberals working for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Liberals raised taxes on 87% of middle-class Canadians. EOS BOS Second, their child poverty claims were declared, even by The Canadian Press, to be a lot of baloney. EOS BOS Third, while the Liberals raised taxes on everybody else, the finance minister was very meticulous in ensuring that none of the tax increases applied to him or Morneau Shepell. EOS BOS Once again, will he finally reveal what he is hiding in this vast network of numbered companies and trust funds, so Canadians can be assured that their finance minister is acting in the public interest, not for his private profit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the finance minister has always been transparent and forthcoming with the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS He has always followed the rules and followed the recommendations, and he has announced he will go even above and beyond.
              I understand why the Conservatives do not want to talk about the economy and prefer to talk about the finance minister. EOS BOS If we remember, and I will give the number, 1.6% was the real annual GDP growth for a decade. EOS BOS That was the worst since Mackenzie King, the worst in 69 years. EOS BOS Let us compare that to today, when Canada is growing its economy at the fastest pace in the G7, and it is 3.7% over the last year. EOS BOS That is what we are doing. EOS BOS That is, again, Conservatives playing politics, and Liberals working for Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, it is one distraction after another. EOS BOS The Prime Minister, his cabinet, the parliamentary secretaries, and the Liberal caucus are the only ones who refuse to acknowledge the obvious fact that the Minister of Finance was indeed in a conflict of interest. EOS BOS He paid a fine for hiding his villa in France, and now he is casting doubt on the Ethics Commissioner's word. EOS BOS Instead of being complicit in this sad affair where the rich can cut a fat cheque to get themselves off the hook, will someone in the government stand up and ask the finance minister to tell us what he is hiding in his numbered companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance has always worked with the Ethics Commissioner and will continue to do so with full transparency to make sure he is following the rules. EOS BOS He has announced that he will go even further by divesting himself of his shares in Morneau Shepell and placing all of his assets in a blind trust so he can continue the important work he does for Canadians. EOS BOS He has been doing this work very successfully for the past two years, which has led to the strongest growth in 10 years—much stronger than anything the Conservatives achieved for Canadians during their 10 years in office. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance has always lived in a world where money can fix everything. EOS BOS He thought he could buy some peace and quiet by writing one big fat cheque and one small cheque. EOS BOS While the big fat cheque is impressive, it is the small cheque that says it all. EOS BOS It confirms that the Minister of Finance was caught red-handed. EOS BOS Knowing that, does the Minister of Finance understand that paying $5 million and $200 does not excuse what he did? EOS BOS Canadians deserve more transparency from their finance minister. EOS BOS When will he tell Canadians what he is hiding in his numbered companies? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the institution responsible for preserving the integrity of Parliament, an institution that we have the utmost faith in and the greatest respect for, is the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS The Minister of Finance has always worked with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and he continues to work with her to ensure that he continues to act on her recommendations and go even further to have the full confidence of Canadians and continue the important work he does for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Government in the House of Commons what bills his government plans to debate for the rest of the week and the week the House returns. EOS BOS This morning, the government once again invoked closure to limit debate on a bill because it views legitimate discussion of its bills as an obstacle. EOS BOS It has invoked closure no less than two times in two days.
							[ EOS BOS English]When my colleague from Skeena—Bulkley Valley spoke weeks ago about a lack of agenda from the government, it did not mean that the government should return to its old ways of shutting down debate at every opportunity. EOS BOS [Translation]Perhaps the hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Government in the House of Commons could tell us what bills he intends to place on the order paper for the rest of this week and the week the House returns. EOS BOS Could he also tell us how many debates he intends to limit? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our focus as a government is on an agenda that puts at the forefront job creation, economic growth and long-term prosperity, with a very clear focus on making our streets and communities safer. EOS BOS With regard to that clear agenda, we have several items to propose for the time ahead. EOS BOS Today we will continue the third reading debate on Bill S-9, the nuclear terrorism act. EOS BOS That is a cornerstone in making our communities safer. EOS BOS After that, we will return to second reading debate on Bill S-12, the incorporation by reference in regulations act. EOS BOS Tomorrow we will finish the second reading debate on Bill C-48, the technical tax amendments act, 2012, again resulting in a more stable and secure economy. EOS BOS After we return from our constituency week on Monday, March 18, the House will consider Bill C-55, the response to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. Tse act, at report stage and third reading now that it has been reported back from committee. EOS BOS This is an important justice measure. EOS BOS I must remind the House that this legislation responds to a Supreme Court decision that takes effect over the Easter adjournment, so it is very important that we be able to pass it here and get it to the Senate for it to deal with before that time. EOS BOS [Translation]Once the House deals with Bill C-55, it could then consider Bills S-9 and S-12, if they are still held up in the House; Bill C-15, the Strengthening Military Justice in the Defence of Canada Act, at report stage and third reading, since that bill has now been reported back from committee; and Bill S-7, the Combating Terrorism Act, at third reading. EOS BOS All these bills are necessary and important for Canadians' safety. EOS BOS [English]Wednesday, March 20, shall be the seventh and final allotted day. EOS BOS As a result, the House will then consider the usual supply motions and appropriation bills that evening. EOS BOS We will give priority to debating Bills C-15 and S-12 on Thursday and Friday, March 21 and 22.I hope that makes clear the agenda that the opposition House leader has apparently been unable to perceive of the government, our clear agenda of delivering on job creation, economic growth, long-term prosperity and safe and secure communities for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, women who have undergone female genital mutilation suffer infections, difficult urination and childbirth, pain during intercourse, and more. EOS BOS Raising awareness of FGM is a core part of the fight against it. EOS BOS This is why it is listed in Canada's citizenship guide as a practice that Canada does not tolerate. EOS BOS No one can put nuance around the violent removal of a woman's clitoris, and if they try to, we should not listen to them. EOS BOS Will the minister end his consultations and decide today that warnings about FGM belong in Canada's citizenship guide? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member opposite that FGM is an abhorrent practice. EOS BOS It is against the laws of Canada. EOS BOS I can assure members of this House that the new guide will reflect Canada's diversity and laws, including the laws on gender-based violence. EOS BOS It will highlight and include, in a better way than the previous government, visible minorities, LGBTQ2 communities, the contributions of women, francophone communities, and indigenous peoples. EOS BOS We will listen to the experts. EOS BOS We will produce and introduce a non-partisan guide, unlike the previous government. EOS
BOS Here is another fairytale, Mr. Speaker. EOS BOS Once upon a time the Conservatives came to Ottawa and promised so much before they broke all of those promises. EOS BOS They promised to stand up for everyday Canadians to end entitlements, and to fight against waste and corruption. EOS BOS They were going to clean up this place, and a big part of that was making changes to the Senate. EOS BOS Remember the triple-E Senate? EOS BOS That was then and this is now. EOS BOS Now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister is reduced to arguing that changing the Senate just is not possible. EOS BOS What has changed? EOS BOS Why did these Conservatives give up all that they stood for? EOS BOS Why have they failed— EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, that gentleman just called the words that I quoted “another fairytale”. EOS BOS Unfortunately for him they are his words. EOS BOS These are the things that he said while he was throwing the member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley under the bus. EOS BOS He admitted that there was $189,000 debt, but it was not his, it was the previous occupant of the House leader's office. EOS BOS It was the member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley's debt. EOS BOS There is one taxpayer. EOS BOS You owe them $2.7 million. EOS BOS Pay it back. EOS </s> BOS Order, please. EOS BOS I will once again have to remind the hon. parliamentary secretary to address his comments through the Chair and not directly at other members. EOS BOS Sometimes it leads to a bit of disorder, which we seem to be experiencing now. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Scarborough—Rouge River. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's guide also says that ministers must stand and be accountable for themselves to Canadians but, still, nothing from the minister. EOS BOS The last election was also tarnished by voter suppression from that party. EOS BOS The Minister of National Defence stood in this House and said that the culprit had been caught. EOS BOS Michael Sona's name was leaked and he was thrown under the bus. EOS BOS Who in government leaked the name? EOS BOS Was it a Prime Minister's office staffer or a ministerial staffer? EOS BOS What evidence did the minister have in leaking the name? EOS BOS Who is next to be thrown under the bus by the government? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. EOS BOS The Conservative Party of Canada ran a clean and ethical campaign and it was not involved in any voter suppression. EOS BOS Obviously, we are all concerned about what took place in the riding of Guelph, which is why we are working with Elections Canada on this important issue. EOS BOS We do know that one conviction has been rendered about robocalls and breaking the law, and that, of course, was by the Liberal campaign that has been convicted and fined for breaking the law, as it properly should be. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives did not hesitate to throw Michael Sona to the wolves in the Guelph robocalls case. EOS BOS Since then, we have not heard a thing. EOS BOS But yesterday we learned from CBC that Andrew Prescott, a Guelph campaign worker, was identified as the individual who downloaded the voter data that was used to commit this fraud. EOS BOS Can the Conservatives confirm that it was indeed Andrew Prescott who had access to this data and that they have handed over the information about this individual to Elections Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our party is working directly with Elections Canada to get all the facts and identify the individuals associated with the allegations about the situation in Guelph. EOS BOS I find it ironic that the New Democratic Party is rising in the House to condemn these violations of the act, when the NDP accepted $340,000 in illegal union donations. EOS BOS The member should rise and provide an explanation. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, such an absurd response to a serious question shows some disturbing and tacit complicity on the part of the Conservatives. EOS BOS Elections Canada has been investigating these fraudulent calls for a year and a half now. EOS BOS This is the worst fraud in Canada's election history, and yet no charges have been laid. EOS BOS If Elections Canada had more power, then perhaps this would have already been sorted out. EOS BOS The NDP had a motion on this subject adopted last spring, but the Conservatives are still dragging their feet. EOS BOS Why are they not fulfilling their promise to give Elections Canada more investigative power? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, I think what is disturbing to all Canadians is that the NDP accepted $340,000 in illegal donations. EOS BOS This is a concern. EOS BOS It is for that reason that we are bringing forth a comprehensive proposal and that proposal will be brought forward in due course. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the changes made to the Parliamentary Protective Service are not working. EOS BOS The House of Commons protective service officers have been without a contract since March, and negotiations have stalled. EOS BOS Furthermore, we recently learned that the employer has started threatening employees who are simply exercising their charter rights. EOS BOS Let me be clear. EOS BOS The colour of a baseball cap does not make me and my colleagues feel any less safe. EOS BOS Will the government amend the Parliament of Canada Act to guarantee the independence of the Parliamentary Protective Service? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are working to restore a culture of respect for the public service, and we will continue to do so throughout our public service, which includes the House of Commons protective service. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would hope that by now we could assume that the minister has finally completed his homework and is up to speed on the 31-page Federal Court decision on veterans pensions. EOS BOS With only a few days before the Conservatives must decide whether to appeal this very clear ruling, is the government now in a position to tell the House and thousands of affected veterans what action it intends to take? EOS </s> BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of National Defence. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the government has allowed the debate to be reopened, despite what it says today. EOS BOS For more than two years the Minister of Health has failed to address the critical issue of drug shortages. EOS BOS Health Canada experts warned that a voluntary system would not work, but the minister ignored them. EOS BOS Now the crisis continues. EOS BOS A recent survey shows that 94% of pharmacists are still experiencing shortages of the drugs that patients need. EOS BOS Why is the minister ignoring the facts and putting the health of Canadians at risk? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our approach has been to work with the provinces and the drug companies so they can share information about drug shortages publicly on a website. EOS BOS It was also encouraging that at this year's health ministers meeting, all ministers agreed to work collaboratively on the issue. EOS BOS We will also continue to monitor whether companies make the information available to doctors and patients and if they do not, then we are open to considering passing regulations requiring them to do so. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, international shipping interests are pushing for five huge commercial anchorages off the shores of Gabriola Island. EOS BOS This is causing great concern in the riding. EOS BOS This project has no local benefit. EOS BOS It threatens the community and the sensitive ecology of our coastline. EOS BOS The Liberal government should not use Harper's environmental rules to assess this project. EOS BOS Will the transport minister reject the request for Gabriola bulk anchorages? EOS BOS It is bad for our local economy, bad for climate change, and there is no upside for Canada. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are committed to delivering on a mandate, and we are putting significant money, $1.5 billion, into an oceans protection plan. EOS BOS We need to manage our natural resources, all of our resources, and we need to spend taxpayers' money responsibly. EOS BOS In support of the Canadian transportation sector, it will be about building new markets and new gateways, providing better service to Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, another week goes by, another Friday night special, a late-night decision on foreign investment by the Conservatives. EOS BOS This time it is the approval of the $15 billion takeover of Nexen by the Chinese government that was delayed. EOS BOS What investors and Canadians are looking for is some sort of certainty, predictability, a clear set of rules. EOS BOS Conservatives have been leaking that the criteria and the process will be changed shortly. EOS BOS Is this true? EOS BOS Will they be changing the entire process before the new Nexen deadline? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government and the minister are taking a thoughtful review of this important transaction. EOS BOS The minister is looking to find out whether it is in the best interests of Canadians, and he is taking the time necessary to get it right. EOS BOS He is taking into consideration the views of stakeholders. EOS BOS They will be considered, including those that are being put forward by Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, what form will that consultation of Canadians take? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry hears regularly from Canadians from coast to coast to coast. EOS BOS He is looking at this transaction, which is a large transaction, to make sure that it is in the best interests of Canadians. EOS BOS That is something that is tremendously important. EOS BOS This is a big deal, and he is taking the time necessary to get it right. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, this should not be such a difficult question. EOS BOS India is an important market, a growing economy. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is there right now. EOS BOS What are the criteria for investing in Canada? EOS BOS What will be his response to Indian investors? EOS BOS What criteria are used to determine the net benefit to Canada? EOS BOS What will be his response to the Indian government? EOS BOS Why are the Conservatives not providing a clear answer to the question? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Canada has received a lot of foreign investment. EOS BOS We welcome foreign investment where it is in the best interests of Canada. EOS BOS Foreign investment helps create jobs and opportunities. EOS BOS The government's policies of keeping taxes low and keeping regulations low have been a real magnet for jobs, investment and opportunity. EOS BOS What the leader of the NDP wants to do is bring in more regulation and a large carbon tax. EOS BOS Let me say, that will be something that would not be welcomed in India or in anywhere else that looks at Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, seven years ago today in this chamber, the Prime Minister apologized to the survivors of residential schools. EOS BOS Today, the Prime Minister was given the unique opportunity to take the first step toward reconciliation. EOS BOS One of the TRC's key calls to action was for the Pope to apologize for the Catholic Church's role in this cultural genocide. EOS BOS Today, at the meeting with His Holiness, the Prime Minister did not ask him to apologize. EOS BOS Apparently, he merely referred to a letter from his Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, which does not even ask for an apology. EOS BOS Why? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development has written to the Vatican to draw its attention to the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. EOS BOS The Prime Minister met with the Pope today and drew attention to that letter as well. EOS BOS It was our Prime Minister who made that historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008. EOS BOS There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that allowed the Indian residential school system to take place. EOS BOS We will continue to move forward in a spirit of reconciliation to take concrete measures to benefit aboriginal Canadians and non-aboriginals alike. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, for the last year and a half, I have been asking the minister what she will do to ensure financial transparency for first nations. EOS BOS In return, I have had platitudes. EOS BOS I have had talk about transparency being important, that she and the chiefs are talking, but nothing has been done. EOS BOS Somehow she says that empowering grassroots band members to have the same information that everyone else has is paternalistic. EOS BOS How much longer do they have to wait? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we fully believe in an open and transparent process of dealing with first nations. EOS BOS We believe in full accountability for all first nations. EOS BOS There is a process in place at this time whereby members can obtain the information through their bands in their respective areas. EOS BOS However, the government is working with first nations toward a new model of transparency and accountability on disclosure of expenses and income EOS BOS . We will continue to do that in consultation with the indigenous councils. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, again, more platitudes and a lack of transparency for the people who are desperately asking for it. EOS BOS It is unacceptable. EOS BOS The Liberal government chooses to enforce the laws that it wants and not the other ones. EOS BOS Liberals have no trouble saying 15,000 youth can go to jail for marijuana possession because that is the law. EOS BOS There is a law on the books. EOS BOS The Liberals either need to have the guts to get rid of it, or enforce it. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, the former government imposed legislation and policy around transparency and accountability on first nations. EOS BOS That is not the way we do business. EOS BOS We work in consultation with first nations. EOS BOS We have been working hard with many indigenous organizations, including the AFN and the Aboriginal Financial Officers Association, on ways to enhance that mutual accountability. EOS BOS We are going to be implementing a process that is a consensus of all involved that will have full accountability and transparency measures. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the F-35 fiasco and the government's monumental incompetence. EOS BOS Why? EOS BOS Because it accepted the generals' decision in 2010 without questioning it, without taking into consideration costs, technical risks, industrial spinoffs and even the main mission of this aircraft, and without using a competitive bidding process. EOS BOS We are talking about tens of billions of dollars. EOS BOS Why is this government being so irresponsible with taxpayers' money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as part of our seven-point plan, a panel of experts at arm's length from the government determined that the evaluation of the various options conducted by the Royal Canadian Air Force was both rigorous and impartial. EOS BOS I would like to sincerely thank this panel for its service to Canada. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are still waiting for that public report. EOS BOS This has been a complete fiasco. EOS BOS We all remember when the ex-minister of defence jumped into that F-35 mock-up like a kid. EOS BOS This was two weeks after he told us there would be a public, fair, open, and transparent competition. EOS BOS That was just a joke. EOS BOS What about all those fantasy costs at the beginning? EOS BOS They have just exploded. EOS BOS Where are we today? EOS BOS We are no further ahead. EOS BOS When is the government going to have a fair, open, and transparent competition to save Canadians money? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as members know, we launched a seven-point plan to review all of the options available to replace the fleet of CF-18s, something that the Liberals never actually did. EOS BOS As part of that, an independent panel reviewed the RCAF evaluation and had this to say about the process:In the end, we are confident in saying that the evaluation process was conducted professionally, that it was not biased in favour of any of the four aircraft and that the resulting report to ministers by the RCAF evaluation team is therefore fair, objective, and impartial in all material respects. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for the quality of his French. EOS BOS There will be an economic update tomorrow. EOS BOS Will the minister be providing an update on his election promises, particularly those relating to small and medium-sized businesses?During the election campaign, the Liberal Party promised to reduce the tax rate to 9%, but it has not done so. EOS BOS Instead, it brought in the Liberal carbon tax and higher Canada pension plan contributions. EOS BOS The government's plan is not working, so what is it going to do to help small businesses, which create wealth and jobs? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, tomorrow I will be telling the House about our economic plan for the future and reviewing the current economic situation. EOS BOS We will have a long-term plan to improve our economy, thereby helping small and medium-sized businesses, families, and the middle class. EOS BOS That is our goal. EOS BOS We have a long-term plan to make things better for our country and the future. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the paradise papers reveal that the Prime Minister's chief fundraiser, Stephen Bronfman, moved millions of dollars to offshore tax havens through a complex web of entities in the U.S., Israel, and the Cayman Islands. EOS BOS The papers show evidence of bogus records to hide payments, false invoicing, and six-figure gifts to avoid paying tax attributed to Bronfman. EOS BOS At the height of a softwood lumber dispute, the Prime Minister chose to take Stephen Bronfman to a state dinner at the White House, leaving his Minister of Natural Resources behind. EOS BOS I have a simple question. EOS BOS What business did Bronfman have at the White House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, if you will permit, on behalf of all Canadians, I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed in Texas, and we hope for a speedy recovery for all of those who were injured yesterday. EOS BOS It is appalling that this act took place in a place of worship, where worshippers should have felt safe. EOS BOS Canada, as a nation, stands in solidarity with the United States during this difficult time. EOS BOS On the other matter, I can assure the opposition that we are fully committed to fighting tax avoidance and tax evasion, and we will continue to ensure that the CRA pursues all infringers upon that for the many years to come. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister spent part of the summer and the fall treating small business owners like tax cheats. EOS BOS He accused them of using loopholes to save on taxes. EOS BOS Let us see what he will do now that some of the Liberals' closest advisers were named in the paradise papers and they are the ones who allegedly used loopholes to shelter their fortunes. EOS BOS How long has the Prime Minister known that Liberal bagman Stephen Bronfman avoids paying all of his taxes in Canada? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, we are fully committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. I will let the individuals concerned comment on their own situation, but I will say that the Canada Revenue Agency is reviewing links to Canadian entities and will take every appropriate action with respect to the paradise papers. EOS BOS In the last two budgets, we invested a historic amount of money to combat tax avoidance and evasion, and our plan is working. EOS BOS There have been 627 cases transferred to criminal investigations, 268 search warrants, and 78 convictions. EOS BOS We will continue— EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Leader of the Opposition. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, first it was the Minister of Finance and now it is Liberal bagman Stephen Bronfman who has been caught red-handed. EOS BOS He apparently hid part of his personal fortune in a tax haven. EOS BOS Why is the Prime Minister still making honest, middle-class Canadian families pay more while allowing his friends to avoid paying taxes in Canada? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, in the last two budgets, we invested nearly $1 billion to identify high-risk taxpayers here and abroad. EOS BOS The Canada Revenue Agency is reviewing links to Canadian entities and will take every appropriate action regarding the paradise papers. EOS BOS Our investments have already yielded results. EOS BOS We have identified $25 billion in unreported income. EOS BOS We will continue to work to create a system that is fair for all Canadians. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Stephen Bronfman once said that his goal was to, “raise a lot of money and to help... EOS BOS [him] become the next Prime Minister. EOS BOS ”
              Bronfman became the Liberal Party's head of revenue, and he hosted cash-for-access events with the Prime Minister. EOS BOS One event was advertised as an opportunity for donors to “form relationships and open dialogues with our government.” EOS BOS Clearly, Bronfman believed that giving money to the Prime Minister would yield favourable outcomes. EOS BOS When did the Prime Minister learn that Bronfman's interests included protecting favourable offshore tax treatment? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as you well know, we are fully committed to fighting tax evasion and tax avoidance EOS BOS . I will let individuals comment on their own situation. EOS BOS However, with respect to the paradise papers, the CRA is reviewing links to Canadian entities and will take every appropriate action. EOS BOS In the last two budgets, we invested nearly $1 billion to identify high-risk taxpayers in Canada and abroad. EOS BOS Our investments have already yielded results. EOS BOS We are on track to recuperate $25 billion from our efforts against tax avoidance and tax evasion. EOS BOS We will continue to work for a system that is fair. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, over the past two years the current Liberal government has demonized retail workers who enjoy an employee discount. EOS BOS It has demonized hard-working entrepreneurs and business owners, and characterized them as tax cheats. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is even raising taxes on diabetics to pay off his billion dollar deficits. EOS BOS Meanwhile, he is here in the House defending a man who hid his assets from the Ethics Commissioner. EOS BOS Why is it that under the current government, it is always the middle class and working Canadians who pay a bit more, while wealthy friends like Stephen Bronfman always end up getting away paying less? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I am happy to talk about what we have done over the past two years. EOS BOS We raised taxes on the wealthiest 1% so we could lower them on the middle class. EOS BOS We have delivered a Canada child benefit that gives more money to nine out of 10 Canadian families to help with the high cost of raising kids. EOS BOS We did that by stopping to sending child benefit cheques to millionaire families. EOS BOS On top of that, we are lowering small business taxes to 9%. EOS BOS We have put more money in the pockets of our most vulnerable seniors, almost $1,000 more, in the guaranteed income supplement. EOS BOS We made it cheaper and more affordable for young people to go to school. EOS BOS That is what we have been doing. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the stats that Prime Minister is quoting actually shows his government is doing a good job going after the small taxpayer, going after ordinary Canadians, but it always lets the big fish go. EOS BOS We know about Stephen Bronfman through the paradise papers, but let us not forget that the government, through committee, stalled the study on KPMG and the Isle of Man. EOS BOS Let us not forget that the government has done nothing about the Panama papers. EOS BOS The government has not taken seriously the issue of tax havens and offshore accounts. EOS BOS When will it? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we have always fought strongly against tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS Indeed, this is a multi-billion dollar issue. EOS BOS That is why we made a billion dollar investment to tackle it. EOS BOS We are reviewing leaks to identify any links to Canadian entities and we will take every appropriate action. EOS BOS We use the information received through leaked lists when they arise, but we do not wait on these lists to attack the problem. EOS BOS That is why the CRA has more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations related to offshore financial structures, under way as of September 30. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government is going after the small taxpayer, but not the big fish. EOS BOS The Prime Minister was elected on the promise to work hard for the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS BOS The middle class cannot afford accounts on the Cayman Islands, but the Liberals' rich and wealthy friends can. EOS BOS The Prime Minister said shortly after his election “Tax avoidance, tax evasion is something we take very seriously”, and promised swift action. EOS BOS Canadians are still waiting. EOS BOS What is the Prime Minister waiting for? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, we are fully committed to fighting tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS That is why we put close to a billion dollars in the last two budgets to do just that. EOS BOS In investing historic sums to make sure we have the right tools to crack down on tax evaders, we have concrete results delivered. EOS BOS There are 627 cases transferred to criminal investigations, 268 search warrants executed, 78 convictions. EOS BOS We will continue to work hard every day for a tax system that is fair for everyone. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, hiring more inspectors without changing the current treaties with tax havens will not amount to much. EOS BOS An international consortium of journalists published a list of new names of people who are benefiting from tax havens: the Queen of England, rock stars, Trump's entourage, and, in Canada, the Liberals. EOS BOS What a surprise. EOS BOS Former Liberal prime ministers, former Liberal senators, and Liberal organizers were named. EOS BOS Are the Liberals doing nothing to combat tax havens in an effort to protect the Liberal family? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, Canadians know full well that in our first two budgets we invested nearly $1 billion to combat tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS We continue to work every day to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. EOS BOS The results speak for themselves: 627 cases have been transferred to criminal investigation, and there have been 268 warrants and 78 convictions EOS BOS . 
              We will continue to work hard every day to create a tax system that is fair for all Canadians. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Cayman Islands is the kind of place where there are more bank accounts than people. EOS BOS Members of the middle class and those working hard to join it do not have bank accounts in the Cayman Islands. EOS BOS For those who do not know, Stephen Bronfman was once the head of the Prime Minister's leadership campaign and is the chief fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada. EOS BOS He also happens to manage a trust in the Cayman Islands. EOS BOS Have the Liberals failed to crack down on tax havens in order to protect Liberal organizers and friends of the Prime Minister? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, as I said, I will let the individuals involved comment on their own situation. EOS BOS Our government continues to crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS We will continue to work for the middle class and those working hard to join it. EOS BOS That is why we lowered taxes for the middle class and raised them for the wealthiest 1%. EOS BOS That is why we created the Canada child benefit, which gives more tax-free money to nine out of 10 families every month. EOS BOS That is why we are in the process of lowering the small business tax rate to 9%. EOS BOS That is what we are doing for the middle class. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, meanwhile, with his tax reform, the Prime Minister spent weeks essentially accusing our farmers, entrepreneurs, and professionals of fraud. EOS BOS The paradise papers scandal is proof of the Liberals' hypocrisy. EOS BOS The names in there are not those of ordinary people. EOS BOS One is the Liberal Party's chief fundraiser, Stephen Bronfman. EOS BOS Another is former Liberal senator Leo Kolber. EOS BOS Both are very good friends of the Liberal Party. EOS BOS My question is simple. EOS BOS When did the Prime Minister find out that his organizer had direct connections to tax havens? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to combatting tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS In our first two budgets, we took concrete steps. EOS BOS We invested $1 billion, we have targeted four jurisdictions per year, and we have hired competent staff. EOS BOS Our plan is working. EOS BOS We have transferred 627 cases to criminal investigation, and there have been 268 search warrants and 78 convictions. EOS BOS The Canada Revenue Agency is scrutinizing links to Canadian entities, and we will take appropriate action. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, they could speed things along if the minister asked the Prime Minister for his friends' phone numbers. EOS BOS Members of the Prime Minister's inner circle are using all kinds of schemes to hide millions of dollars in tax havens. EOS BOS There is no doubt that the Prime Minister and Stephen Bronfman are connected. EOS BOS They have even vacationed together. EOS BOS In 2015, Mr. Bronfman said that he was prepared to do everything he could to help the Prime Minister win. EOS BOS Why did the Prime Minister let his friend, the Liberal Party's chief fundraiser, avoid paying taxes like all other Canadians are required to do? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, I repeat that our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion. EOS BOS The opposition members' hypocrisy is astounding. EOS BOS The former minister of national revenue, Mr. Blackburn, clearly stated in an interview that this was not even a priority for the previous Conservative government. EOS BOS We do not need any lessons from a party that works every day to protect privileges for the wealthy. EOS BOS Canadians expect a fair tax system. EOS BOS That is what we promised, and that is what we will deliver. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, with the Liberals it is always the same, “You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours”. EOS BOS Stephen Bronfman said to the Prime Minister, “ EOS BOS Anything I can do to help, just let me know”. EOS BOS The Prime Minister said “a big thanks for your help”, nudge nudge, wink wink, and the Liberals' buddies are taken care of once again. EOS BOS Does the Prime Minister not see why Canadians are so outraged by yet another example of Liberal hypocrisy and conflict of interest? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion. EOS BOS We have invested nearly $1 billion over the past two years, and we can announce that we are very close to recovering $25 billion. EOS BOS Our strategies and measures are yielding results. EOS BOS I want to reassure the public that the Canada Revenue Agency is reviewing links to Canadian entities, and we will take appropriate action. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, when Bronfman said that the goal was to raise a lot of money to help this guy become the next prime minister, he was not doing it as an act of charity. EOS BOS He, as all Liberals do, always wants something in return. EOS BOS He and the Prime Minister are close friends and Bronfman is an integral part of the Prime Minister's inner circle.
               If the Prime Minister is truly concerned about the tax avoiders revealed in the paradise papers, will he instruct his party to return all the money raised by Bronfman, yes or no? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion and tax avoidance, to make sure the tax system is fair and equitable for all Canadians. EOS BOS I am proud of the leadership role Canada has taken on the international stage. EOS BOS Co-operation between revenue authorities, including the exchange of tax information, is an essential tool for maintaining the integrity of Canada's tax base. EOS BOS Our efforts have borne fruit, as we are about to recoup $25 billion. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, Stephen Bronfman is the Prime Minister's top moneyman, and was the Liberal Party's “revenue chair”. EOS BOS The Prime Minister vacations with him. EOS BOS He even broke protocol to bring him to a state dinner with then President Obama. EOS BOS Now we know that he used a $60-million tax haven scheme to avoid paying his fair share in Canada. EOS BOS If the Prime Minister wants to restore any credibility on the issue of tax fairness, will he immediately order the Liberal Party to give back all the money Stephen Bronfman raised for the Liberals? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion. EOS BOS The historic $1-billion investment we made in our last two budgets is yielding concrete, tangible results for Canadians. EOS BOS We are about to recoup $25 billion. EOS BOS We investigate four new jurisdictions per year. EOS BOS Our plan is delivering results. EOS BOS We have had 627 cases transferred to criminal investigations, 268 search warrants executed, and 78 convictions. EOS BOS We continue to work for Canadians. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have spent another billion dollars on tax collectors. EOS BOS Who have those tax collectors gone after? EOS BOS Have they gone after Morneau Shepell? EOS BOS Have they gone after the billionaire Bronfman family, or have they instead decided to go after people suffering with diabetes, or after minimum wage-earning waitresses who enjoy a small chicken sandwich at the end of the shift or after small businesses and farmers? EOS BOS When will this high-tax hypocrisy come to an end? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, every Canadian has a friend or relative who is affected by mental health problems, and the social and economic costs are extremely high. EOS BOS We are giving a record number of tax credits to people with disabilities and people with mental health problems. EOS BOS In budget 2017, we invested $5 billion so we could help 500,000 Canadians under the age of 25, and we will continue to focus on helping those most in need. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, the government does not understand anything about international tax avoidance because it continues to ignore the fundamental problem of tax havens instead of addressing it. EOS BOS The minister still believes that the solution to tax havens is to invest in the Canada Revenue Agency. EOS BOS However, the fundamental problem lies in our overly permissive legislation that the Liberal Party's cronies benefit from. EOS BOS Could the minister get her head out of the sand, especially since she voted for an NDP motion calling for action against tax avoidance and tax havens? EOS BOS Why has the minister still not proposed any measures to put an end to this legal tax scam? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if only my colleague opposite could show as many results as we have with respect to tax avoidance. EOS BOS Over the past two years, we invested $1 billion. EOS BOS We are very close to recovering $25 billion. EOS BOS People are facing charges. EOS BOS We have been meeting with four new jurisdictions every year. EOS BOS Cases are being handed over to criminal investigations. EOS BOS We are on track to meet Canadians' expectations. EOS BOS It is what we promised in our platform and we are keeping that promise. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, it did not take long for the Liberals to start acting like Liberals, placing wealthy friends ahead of everyday Canadians. EOS BOS In March of this year, the Liberals voted in favour of the NDP's motion calling on the government to take action to tackle tax haven, including renegotiating tax treaties that let companies repatriate profits from tax havens to Canada tax free. EOS BOS Here is a spoiler alert; they have not done any of it yet. EOS BOS Did the Prime Minister refuse to act on tax havens to help his wealthy friends? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our position on the issue was quite clear during the campaign. EOS BOS We said we would combat tax evasion and tax havens. EOS BOS We have invested $1 billion over the past two years. EOS BOS We have produced results for Canadians. EOS BOS We are going to recoup close to $25 billion. EOS BOS We have criminal investigations under way. EOS BOS We are working with tax administrations around the world. EOS BOS I can say that I am very proud of the international leadership role we have taken. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, a major ethics crisis involving the Prime Minister of Canada is tarnishing Canada's international reputation. EOS BOS We now know that Stephen Bronfman, the Liberal Party's chief fundraiser, had questionable dealings with tax havens. EOS BOS Mr. Bronfman is a close friend of the Prime Minister. EOS BOS They are so close, in fact, that when the Prime Minister visited the White House a year and a half ago, he left his Minister of Natural Resources behind but brought his good friend Bronfman, the Liberal Party's top bagman, to the White House with him. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister give us just one good reason why he left his Minister of Natural Resources in Ottawa and brought along his close Liberal friend and fundraiser? EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is firmly committed to combatting tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS What we want is a fair and equitable tax system for all Canadians. EOS BOS Our actions are producing results. EOS BOS We have invested close to $1 billion over the past two years, which will enable us to recoup nearly $25 billion. EOS BOS I am very proud of the international leadership role we have taken. EOS BOS We are working with our partners around the world. EOS BOS That is what Canadians asked us to do, and that is what we are going to do. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, the Prime Minister is very close to the Bronfman family and to Stephen Bronfman in particular. EOS BOS This reflects poorly on Canada. EOS BOS Here is what the influential newspaper The Guardian wrote this morning: “ EOS BOS The chief fundraiser and senior adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister...who played a critical role in [his] rise to power...”. EOS BOS That is huge. EOS BOS We are not talking about some humble supporter who put out some lawn signs. EOS BOS This is the money man who helped get the Prime Minister where he is today. EOS BOS Can the Prime Minister give us one good reason why, when he went to Washington, he left the Minister of Natural Resources in Ottawa but took his Liberal buddy— EOS
BOS Order. EOS BOS The hon. EOS BOS Minister of National Revenue. EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion. EOS BOS I do not understand my colleagues across the way. EOS BOS The Conservatives' hypocrisy is stunning. EOS BOS A former Canada Revenue Agency minister, Jean-Pierre Blackburn, even had the nerve to say that tax evasion was not even a priority for the Conservative government. EOS BOS We made an election promise to crack down on tax evasion, we are taking action, and we will continue to work to ensure that everyone pays their fair share and that we have a tax system that is fair for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about hypocrisy, let us talk about two sets of tax rules, one for Liberals and one for everyday working-class Canadians. EOS BOS Bronfman and his associates are reported to have engaged in bogus record-keeping, false invoicing, and six-figure gifts to avoid paying tax. EOS BOS The Prime Minister continues to protect him. EOS BOS The Prime Minister is so close to Bronfman that at the height of a softwood lumber dispute, he took him to the White House instead of the natural resources minister. EOS BOS Canadian taxpayers paid for that trip. EOS BOS We ask the government again, what business did Bronfman have at the White House? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, in our first two budgets, we invested nearly $1 billion, a historic amount, to combat tax evasion and tax avoidance. EOS BOS Our plan is working. EOS BOS There have been 627 cases transferred to criminal investigation, 268 search warrants and 78 convictions. EOS BOS The Canada Revenue Agency is scrutinizing links to Canadian entities and will take appropriate measures. EOS BOS We continue to work toward a tax system that is fair and equitable for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, a Liberal is Liberal is a Liberal, and we can always count on them to be entitled to their entitlements, entitled to take private helicopters on private island vacations, entitled to taxpayer-funded nannies, entitled to protecting their vast family fortunes from many unfair tax changes, entitled to setting up offshore tax havens in France, Barbados, or the Cayman Islands. EOS BOS Canadians are entitled to know, why do they always end up footing the bill when these lifestyle of the rich and famous Liberals pay less? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. EOS BOS I want to reassure Canadians that, personally, as the minister responsible for the Canada Revenue Agency, I have no one to protect. EOS BOS There are laws that apply and they will apply to everyone so that we have a tax system that is fair and equitable for all Canadians. EOS
BOS Mr. Speaker, during the consultations on the legalization of marijuana, Dr. Chris Rumball indicated that the Prime Minister's plan needed to take into account the sad incidents that have occurred in the United States, where the number of fatal accidents caused by drivers who tested positive for marijuana doubled in the state of Washington and tripled in Colorado. EOS BOS I am concerned, police officers are concerned, and Canadians are concerned. EOS BOS Can the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness reassure us that police officers will have the tools they need to detect whether drivers are impaired by drugs before the government legalizes marijuana? EOS </s> BOS Mr. Speaker, indeed, we have made that point very clear from the very beginning of our discussions with respect to marijuana. EOS BOS We are obviously going to legalize cannabis and apply a very strict regulatory regime around the use of the product. EOS BOS With respect to drug-impaired driving, that is already a criminal offence in Canada, and we will make sure it remains so. EOS BOS We will also make sure the police have the technical tools to enforce the law effectively. EOS
