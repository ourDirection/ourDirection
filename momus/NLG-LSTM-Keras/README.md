# Natural-Language-Generation-using-LSTM-Keras
Here we are trying to generate text using Deep Learning. We are using RNN(LSTM) to generate text on the fly.

We are using keras that act as a Wrapper on top of Theano/Tensorflow to create ML models easily as creating models using Theano or Tensorflow requires a lot of code to be written.

Requirements -
1. Python 3
2. Google word vectors (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)
3. Theano/Tensorflow (I have created model using Theano)
4. Keras (As a wrapper around Theano/Tensoflow)

Just run Natural Language Generation using LSTM-Keras.ipynb notebook to train the model and check results.
I highly recommend to use GPU as data is really huge and to complete the training with good accuracy.

Feel free to give your feedback.
