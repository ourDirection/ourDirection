,Q,A
0,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating the  \lineBreak Where is the government's desire to work with others?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the new Leader of the Opposition. His party was very successful in the recent election, and we can see the results of that here today. In the throne speech, we repeated the promises we made to voters during the election. The result is clear: we now have a stable majority Conservative government."
1,"Mr. Speaker, in the election Canadians clearly voted for change and they clearly wanted members of Parliament to work together. That emotion and sentiment was very strong. They wanted a focus on their families and the issues that were affecting them each and every day. \lineBreak New Democrats have committed to work respectfully, to end heckling and to give this place the decorum that it deserves. Will the government commit today to do the same?","Mr. Speaker, we are, of course, looking forward to a mandate in which we can move forward constructively on the issues that we talked about with Canadians and to have in this House a debate that is meaningful, thoughtful and focused on policy and on the values of Canadians.  \lineBreak I think we are going to have that in the years to come. It promises to be a very good, productive and constructive Parliament. I know that with our clear mandate, having laid out exactly what we would do to Canadians—"
2,"Mr. Speaker, both our rural and urban communities need help to revitalize their infrastructure. Take, for example, the Champlain Bridge. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak Will this development be sustainable? Will public transit be part of the plan?","Mr. Speaker, our government has already invested a record amount of money in infrastructure. Our government also has an exceptional track record when it comes to transfers to cities and municipalities. \lineBreak Since 2009, our government has committed unprecedented stimulus contributions, which were announced in the March budget and which will be once again introduced today, with improvements, that the gas tax fund will be made permanent. That is an achievement of this government. We are proud of it and we are going to move forward."
3,"Mr. Speaker, in the 1990s, the federal deficit was downloaded onto the backs of Canadian communities. Twenty years later, Canadians are stuck in traffic, our bridges are crumbling, and our water systems are failing. Friday's throne speech ignored municipalities and infrastructure completely. Canadians deserve a vision, a national public transit strategy. \lineBreak Will the government act immediately with new funds to deal with the $123 billion infrastructure deficit?","Mr. Speaker, the member will recall that in 2007, we extended the gas tax fund by four years. In 2009, we doubled the gas tax fund. In 2010, despite economic challenges and despite efforts to keep costs down, we protected the gas tax fund.  \lineBreak In today's budget, she will have occasion to stand and join hands with our government as we move forward with an effort to make the gas tax fund permanent in order to help our communities right across the country."
4,"Mr. Speaker, Canada Post belongs to us and is mandated to provide postal service to all Canadians.  \lineBreak Lately, Conservatives have been whittling away at economically stable elements of Canada Post and have moved toward privatization. \lineBreak Does the government not realize that no private alternative can deliver Canada Post's mandate? Will the government use its influence to make sure management remembers that its mandate is to serve Canadians comes first?","Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to quality postal service for all Canadians no matter where they live.  \lineBreak Last year, Canada Post began a $2.1 billion modernization initiative which will make major investments in equipment, technology and other processes. \lineBreak We are making Canada Post more effective for Canadians, the clients, the people whom Canada Post serves, and I think Canadians will be very pleased with the results."
5,"Mr. Speaker, last year, Canada Post made $281 million in profit; yet, it is still asking its employees for concessions. This attitude threatens services in rural and remote areas. No private sector alternative would be able to deliver the mandate of Canada Post, which is to provide postal service to all Canadians. \lineBreak Will the federal government use its influence to remind Canada Post's management that its primary mandate is to provide services to all Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is mandated to provide postal service to Canadians regardless of where they live. Canada Post has made substantial investments in the infrastructure of Canada Post to the sum of $2.1 billion, as I have already mentioned. \lineBreak We are working to ensure that Canadians receive the best possible postal service regardless of where they live, and I look forward to working with the opposition parties and all stakeholders to ensure that Canadians get their mail when they ask for it."
6,"Mr. Speaker, the Health Council of Canada released its 2011 progress report and the conclusion is very clear. The government failed to make progress because it failed to show leadership.  \lineBreak Conservatives stalled altogether on a cost-saving national prescription drug program, failing Canadians who are now facing extraordinary drug costs. \lineBreak Will the government acknowledge its lack of progress and commit to working with New Democrats to protect Canada's health care system?","Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleague for the next four years. \lineBreak Our government recognizes the importance of timely access to health care and is working to support the provinces and the territories in their efforts to address the issue of wait times, as an example.  \lineBreak We have increased the transfers to the provinces by over 33% since we formed government, so that the provinces and territories can continue to focus in areas of importance. \lineBreak We will work collaboratively with the provinces and territories to renew the health care accord and to continue to reduce wait times in their respective jurisdictions. "
7,"Mr. Speaker, health care is far too important for just empty rhetoric and Canadians are very tired of false promises. Leading into the 2014 health care negotiations, now is the time to bring in much needed improvements. \lineBreak Will the government commit to holding open consultations with Canadians, so that the next accord reflects their values and priorities for health care in this country?","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we are looking forward to working with the provinces and territories to renew the health accord and to continue to address the area of wait times, as an example, while respecting the fact that health care is delivered by and is under the jurisdiction of the provinces.  \lineBreak Our discussions will emphasize the importance of accountability and results for Canadians, including better reporting from the provinces and territories to measure progress and guarantees covering additional medically necessary procedures."
8,"Mr. Speaker, after last week's throne speech, we learned that the government is about to disband the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, which, since 2004, has been examining the legislation, programs and policies that affect Canadian women from all walks of life. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, as it is my first time getting up in the House in our four year majority mandate, I would like to thank the constituents of  \lineBreak I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague and all the women who have been elected to Parliament in the last election. \lineBreak  I can assure members opposite that I will be working collaboratively with all women in the House, including those who sit on the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, to improve the lives of women all across this country."
9,"Mr. Speaker, when the government announced the beginning of Canada's participation in the mission in Libya it said it was an effort to protect civilians. Subsequently, there has been some confusion about the mission's objectives.  \lineBreak We are wondering if the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for  \lineBreak There is no change in the military mission. The military mission was approved by the United Nations through resolutions 1970 and 1973 to protect the civilian population from attacks by Gadhafi's forces.  \lineBreak I look forward to debating an extension of that mission with the member and all members of the House in short order."
10,"Mr. Speaker, France and Italy have recognized the Libyan National Council as that country's legitimate government. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, in Canada we recognize states, not particular governments.  \lineBreak We do look forward to working with the council throughout the Canadian mission in Libya. It has a very important role to play in the future of Libya.  \lineBreak The G8 leaders at their summit in Deauville did say at a political level that Colonel Gadhafi must go. That is an important political objective. We can work closely with the transitional council on this important objective."
11,"Mr. Speaker, throughout 2009 and most of 2010, the  \lineBreak But in reality, as early as March 2009 the government had put all options back on the table despite what the  \lineBreak Why did the ","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to tell the House that the  \lineBreak I believe the member for "
12,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are right to question the government's promises on Afghanistan. \lineBreak For over a year the Conservatives repeatedly denied being pressured to extend our military mission by the United States, yet we now know the Americans made a formal request for Canada to extend the mission in 2009. Instead of saying “no”, the government just asked them to have patience. \lineBreak How can we trust a ","Mr. Speaker, as the member for  \lineBreak We have debated this issue a number of times here in the House of Commons. We take the member's questions on a regular basis and I look forward to doing so in the coming session of Parliament."
13,"Mr. Speaker, Canada is about to invest $35 billion in a maritime strategy that could create jobs in all shipyards across the country. What should be good news is worrying shipyard workers because foreign companies like BEA Systems want their piece of the pie. The NDP raised these concerns several times last winter. \lineBreak Can the government now confirm that Canadian shipyards will be the only beneficiaries, the only shipbuilders in this maritime strategy? ","Mr. Speaker, when the government made the historic decision to build the ships that our navy and Coast Guard needed right here in Canada, what that meant was more than 75 million man hours of work for the shipbuilding industry and for the manufacturing sector over the coming decade. \lineBreak This is a competitive, open, transparent process between several shipyards. At the end of the day, two shipyards will be chosen to do a great deal of work on behalf of the shipbuilding industry, but there will be shipyards and manufacturing sectors all across this country that will benefit from those jobs."
14,"Mr. Speaker, that is just the problem. The government says, “Trust us on jobs, trust us on this file”, but the reality is that it has been playing politics with this issue. \lineBreak  With this much money and jobs on the line, Canadians must see that there is a smart overall strategy that puts forward the strength of each of our shipbuilding regions in B.C., Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. \lineBreak Will the government stop the political games and look to use the strength of every shipbuilding region of our country in these contracts, so that all Canadians could benefit from this strategy?","Mr. Speaker, as the member well knows, the process that is under way is at arm's-length from the government through what is called the shipbuilding secretariat. \lineBreak We have created an open, fair, transparent and very competitive process. This process includes not only independent oversight provided by KPMG but also a fairness monitor and an international third party marine expert that is evaluating these bids to ensure the fairness, openness and transparency of the process. \lineBreak At the end of the day, this is a very competitive process. Again, this will create 75 million man hours of work across this country."
15,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government continues to shake the confidence of federal public servants. Threats of blind cuts are looming in the national capital region. Today we learn that the government has already increased the use of vulnerable temporary workers by 100%. \lineBreak Why does the Conservative government prefer using cheap labour over paying its public servants properly?","Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member to this place and I also thank the electorate of  \lineBreak The issues that the hon. member refers to involve merely 1% of total payroll expenditures. Of course, we use temporary help when it is crucial to ensure the delivery of services to all Canadians that are needed to meet unexpected circumstances, fluctuations in workload and special expertise. Those are the things that help us deliver services to Canadians and that is why we are proud to do it."
16,"Mr. Speaker, in an article published today in  \lineBreak Is that what this government envisions for the future of the national capital region: precarious work, privatization and cheap labour?","Mr. Speaker, the main estimates and the budget outline the government's annual priorities with regard to budgetary planning and resource allocation for the fiscal year. The main estimates include details on planned budgetary expenditures of more than $2,000 billion for the fiscal year. \lineBreak We are doing things in a prudent way and spending on things that Canadians care about. That was our mandate and we are going through with it."
17,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has just won another environmental booby prize. Canada was the last country to report its greenhouse gas emissions data to the UN. Canada's delay in complying with its Kyoto protocol obligations is another Conservative failure in terms of the environment. Even Japan, despite the terrible tsunami, met the deadline. \lineBreak Why did the government not report its data on time?","Mr. Speaker, let me first congratulate my colleague on her appointment to the environment file.  \lineBreak In rising for the first time in this House, I would like to thank the voters of  \lineBreak The Government of Canada has always fully and fastidiously complied with the reporting requirements of the Kyoto treaty. There was a 15-day grace period allowed at the end of the deadline, which occurred during the election, and we have filed those details."
18,"Mr. Speaker, it turns out that not only were we late reporting our data this year, but the government also decided to quietly remove data on tar sands emissions. It is no wonder, because the data showed a 20% increase in tar sands emissions in 2009 alone. That is more than every single car in Canada. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I would first offer a correction to my hon. colleague. We refer to the wealth of abundance in northern Alberta as “oil sands”. \lineBreak With regard to the question, in our reporting of the 2008 emissions the department attempted to offer sectoral numbers. It did not work and they were not included."
19,"Mr. Speaker, climate change was not mentioned even once in the throne speech. Now the Conference Board gives Canada a failing grade for climate policies. These plans are so disorganized and inefficient that Canada will not meet its 2020 target. \lineBreak  After five years of ignoring climate change, will the Conservatives commit to a national plan that addresses the very real challenges?","Mr. Speaker, I again congratulate my hon. colleague on her appointment to the environment file.  \lineBreak We do have a plan and that plan is working. We have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sector by sector and that plan is working. \lineBreak With regard to the Speech from the Throne, I think my colleague was somewhat literal in her expectations. We reiterated our commitment to reduce climate change emissions across the board."
20,"Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada released its 2011 climate change plan to the United Nations. The plan shows that actions taken by the Conservative government are projected to reduce emissions by only one-quarter of what is needed to meet the 2020 target. \lineBreak Does the government have a plan to address the other three-quarters beyond deliberately fudging a progress report to the UN?","The short answer to that question, Mr. Speaker, is yes. We have a plan and I would advise my colleague to familiarize herself with it. She and all Canadians can visit the Environment Canada website to see how we began last year with the major emitting sector, transportation. We are about to address new regulations for coal-fired electricity generation. We will continue to work our way around the emitting sectors to meet our 2020 target."
21,"Mr. Speaker, the federal government's gradual withdrawal from social housing and the fight against homelessness is at risk of causing a dramatic increase in rental costs for hundreds of thousands of low-income renters. Many others will be left out on the streets.  \lineBreak Stakeholders at all levels are demanding that the federal government also do its part, be it through the homelessness partnering strategy or HPS or other housing programs. Will the government remedy this situation?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the new member and wish her luck. \lineBreak I also take this opportunity to thank the good folks of Haldimand—Norfolk for once again placing their trust in me. I pledge to honour that trust to the best of my ability. \lineBreak During our economic action plan, we made tremendous investments in social and affordable housing. Some 26,000 projects are under way right across the country. Unfortunately, the hon. member's party did not support those initiatives that are helping so many people who are vulnerable."
22,"Mr. Speaker, they are fine words, but they are just not good enough.  \lineBreak Instead of working to fix the problem, Conservatives actually cut housing programs. Last year, thousands of Ontario families could not afford decent roofs over their heads, and almost 70,000 of those families live in Toronto. Make no mistake that this is a national crisis and seniors bear the biggest burden. \lineBreak When will the government open its eyes and address this issue? We need a national housing strategy.","Mr. Speaker, we believe that having roofs over their heads is one of the hallmarks to help people get out of poverty, get into the workforce and lead self-sustaining lives. It is good for them and it is good for the country. That is why we have invested record amounts of money in affordable and social housing. Through our economic action plan, we supported the renovation and construction of some 26,000 units right across the country. Had it been up to the NDP, 26,000 families would not have received our help this way."
23,"Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to protecting and strengthening the long-term financial security of hard-working Canadians. Free trade creates jobs and economic opportunities and that is why we have made it a priority to open new markets for Canadian businesses. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on being re-elected for a third time by the good residents of  \lineBreak Closing the doors to the world is not an option for us. Canadians know this is a kitchen table issue and how important free trade is to our country."
24,"Mr. Speaker, Fabien Melanson, a 15-year Canadian veteran who served twice overseas, has started a hunger strike in front of the Department of Veterans Affairs in my riding of  \lineBreak Mr. Melanson has tried to have government take ownership of the trouble created when a clerical error caused a lapse in his benefits. \lineBreak My question is for the ","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his recent appointment. \lineBreak As the member is aware, under the Privacy Act, I cannot discuss the specific details of this individual case. However, I was given a mandate by the people of  \lineBreak What took place many years ago was unfortunate and was an unacceptable mistake. Corrective measures were taken. I have instructed my officials to follow up on this veteran's case—"
25,"Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, the justice department sent a threatening letter to USW Local 1005, ordering the steelworkers to cease their information pickets on the Burlington lift bridge. However, these workers are simply doing what the federal government is refusing to do. They are trying to stop U.S. Steel from taking profits from its Hamilton operations until the federal government's court case against the company is resolved. \lineBreak Instead of getting tough on Canadian workers, when will the government get tough on foreign companies that break Canadian laws, undermine Canadian jobs and attack Canadian pensions?","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member opposite on her recent election in the same area that I come from, and I thank the residents of  \lineBreak As the member opposite knows, this matter is one of provincial regulation. However, we are monitoring the situation, as we would, and I speak to the Minister of Labour in Ontario on the matter almost on a monthly basis to ensure that we can keep track of what is going on there."
26,"Mr. Speaker, last week, the Governor General highlighted our government was here for all Canadians. \lineBreak My question is for the new ","Mr. Speaker, economic growth and jobs will remain priorities for this government because they are the priorities of Canadians. We have designated 2011 as the Year of the Entrepreneur in order to help Canadians understand the role of entrepreneurs, who create our country's wealth. We need to reduce the red tape imposed on them, and we need to do so as quickly as possible. And that is what we will be doing with the Red Tape Reduction Commission."
27,"Mr. Speaker, Diamond Aircraft had a solid order for 240 jets worth $400 million, private sector funding and a loan guarantee from the Ontario government. All that was needed to secure hundreds of jobs and a place for Canada in the modern aerospace industry was a commitment from the federal government. That commitment was denied. It was a major blow to job creation and to the London families that depended on those jobs. \lineBreak Could the minister explain to the people of London why Diamond Aircraft was refused funding?","Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to congratulate the member for her re-election and thank the people of  \lineBreak The Government of Canada has already invested some $20 million into this company, through the strategic aerospace and defence initiative. However, as stewards of taxpayer dollars, it would not be judicious to increase that amount by another $35 million. \lineBreak After a thorough review of Diamond's request, the company was advised by this government that we could not support the request. The company has other alternatives that it is exploring. We wish it well."
28,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak The 3,000 victims of the flooding in the Montérégie region are no less deserving than the victims in Manitoba and Alberta. Yet the ","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Forces will remain in these regions during the emergency period to provide assistance to the civilian authorities, until their specific skills are no longer needed. \lineBreak The member would know that the regional minister for Quebec attended the flood-ravaged area, as did the  \lineBreak  Our thoughts are certainly with the people of the region. We will continue to work with them as members of the Canadian Forces continue to go about their important work there."
29,"Mr. Speaker, while we are tossing these kind words around, the people in the Montérégie region have been up to their necks in water for the past 50 days. While we are tossing these kind words around, the  \lineBreak Why does the  \lineBreak In 1998, Jean Chrétien called Lucien Bouchard to see what was needed. People want help from the army. What has happened to them is not their fault. Instead of being attacked, they want people to come help them clean up. What are they waiting for?","Mr. Speaker, along with the hon. member and all Canadians, we are very sympathetic to the plight of those affected by the floods not only in Quebec but in Manitoba, as well those who are suffering in Saskatchewan. \lineBreak As members know, the "
30,"Mr. Speaker, people in Montérégie are struggling with the worst flooding that this region has ever seen. After 50 days, when the  \lineBreak Why does this double standard exist for the people of Montérégie?","Mr. Speaker, our government understands the difficulties and the stress that the disaster victims are experiencing in the Montérégie region. That is why we have expedited processing of their employment insurance claims. Once I learned about the situation, I made a request to the department. Information is now available on our website. "
31,"Mr. Speaker, back home, the entire Montérégie region is flooded. The people are exhausted. The government thought it was more important to expedite employment insurance to disaster victims in Manitoba and Alberta, and victims in Quebec have been ignored until now. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, natural disaster victims across Canada must receive the same support from their government, regardless of where they live. That is why, as soon as I learned about this situation, I asked the department to ensure that the victims of flooding in the Montérégie region immediately receive the same priority processing for employment insurance claims as victims in the rest of Canada. That priority processing is available immediately, and information is available on our website."
32,"Mr. Speaker, it has cost Canada some $300 million to close Camp Mirage in the UAE. We now learn that the  \lineBreak Will the minister tell Canadian taxpayers how much this reopening will cost in addition to the already $300 million sunk because of a turf war between the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the new defence critic for the Liberal Party and assure him that relations between the  \lineBreak I can also tell the member that his figures are completely wrong. Those numbers are completely false. What we have done, obviously, is to make arrangements to have logistic hubs in parts of the Middle East that allow us to continue the logistic support for the ongoing mission in Afghanistan. That is the intention of the department, nothing more than that."
33,"I am sure the official record will show the sentiment that was just expressed, Mr. Speaker. \lineBreak This spring has been extraordinary and unprecedented in the Arab world. The shift towards democracy is not an easy one. The people of those countries need support. Last month, the G8 promised $20 billion, but there is nothing from Canada. The Conservatives do not seem to understand the importance of committing to helping these people make the transition. \lineBreak Why has Canada isolated itself from its G8 allies?","Mr. Speaker, at the outset of my time in the House, let me thank the electors of Ottawa West—Nepean and congratulate my friend, the new  \lineBreak I can correct the correct the record and tell the "
34,"Mr. Speaker, millions of Canadians have to get by without the medical care they need because they do not have a family doctor. This means more families are turning to emergency rooms just for primary care. Not only is this hurting the health of Canadians, but it also increases the pressure on emergency rooms and costs millions more for everyone. \lineBreak Will the government finally agree to work with the provinces and the territories to hire more health care professionals?","Mr. Speaker, as the member is well aware, the health accord expires in 2014, not this year, not next year and not the year after.  \lineBreak In the meantime, our government will continue to work with the provinces and the territories on the present accord and priorities identified, such as encouraging the statutory review of the accord in both the Senate and the House, as well as to be supportive of the provinces and territories in the reduction of wait times. \lineBreak We have also gained a lot of ground on establishing electronic health records and a number of other initiatives."
35,"Mr. Speaker, after seven years with that health accord, none of it is translated into doctors for Canadian families. \lineBreak The Conservatives had a second chance to address this in the budget but, incredibly, they let it go. The fact is that Canada needs thousands of new doctors and nurses stat, and the provinces are looking to the federal government to help solve this need. \lineBreak Again, will the government work with us to improve these front-line services so that Canadian families get the health care they need and deserve?","Mr. Speaker, our government supports the efforts of the provinces and territories to effectively manage their health care providers so that there are adequate numbers of medical practitioners available to their residents.  \lineBreak While the supply of physicians and nurses is a provincial and territorial responsibility, our government has increased health care transfers to the provinces and territories by more than 33% since we formed the government.  \lineBreak As well, I recently announced federal funding to support more than 100 family medicine residents to receive training in provinces to provide medical services to remote and rural communities."
36,"Mr. Speaker, with the E. coli outbreak in Europe, in Germany in particular, Canadians have good reason to be concerned about the safety of their food. This crisis emerged despite the fact that Germany has a better food inspection system than Canada. \lineBreak Can the government assure Canadians that our food inspection system will protect them from this type of harm?","Mr. Speaker, food safety is of key importance to this government.  \lineBreak We are taking measures to protect Canadians against what is happening in the European Union. CFIA is implementing enhanced border controls on vegetables from the European Union. If affected products are found, CFIA will facilitate recalls to keep Canadian families safe."
37,"Mr. Speaker, we have heard this story before. The government promises $100 million over five years for food safety, yet the budget delivers $9 million in the first year, $8 million in the second year and, of course, nothing after that. \lineBreak In 2009 the government promised to fix food inspection in this country, yet here we are again with the same old promises. Why should Canadians trust the Conservatives now? \lineBreak Will the minister commit to increasing and accelerating the funding in the first two years to ensure that food safety is safe for all Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the member that a report on OECD countries recognized that Canada's superior food safety system ranks us the best in the world on food recalls. \lineBreak Speaking of the budget, our recent budget includes an additional $100 million over five years to enhance food safety. Will the member who is so concerned about food safety support this budget?"
38,"Mr. Speaker, today a quarter of a million Canadian seniors live in poverty. Seniors who built this country and cared for us are struggling to afford basics like food, housing and prescription drugs. \lineBreak  Instead of lifting every senior out of poverty, the government chose to give the poorest seniors a mere $50 a month. \lineBreak How can the minister possibly explain why corporate tax giveaways are more important than raising all Canadian seniors out of poverty?","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague once again for returning to this House. It is going to be a joy to work with her. \lineBreak I want to address the very need of seniors. As we all know, seniors are expecting to have this increase in the guaranteed income supplement. I am hopeful that my colleague across the way is prepared to support the measure in the budget to increase the guaranteed income supplement for our seniors, and if not, why not."
39,"Mr. Speaker, in Canada, almost half the women over 65 who live alone have incomes below the poverty line. This government boasts about helping seniors, but it is giving crumbs to only a third of seniors in need. \lineBreak Why is this government abandoning two-thirds of seniors in need, the majority of whom are women living alone?","Mr. Speaker, we want to help our seniors, who helped build this great and beautiful country. That is why, in yesterday's budget, we included an increase to the GIS in order to help the most vulnerable seniors. I hope the NDP will support this effort to help these people."
40,"Mr. Speaker, last month, the president and CEO of the Canada pension plan explained that public pension funds were ripe for expansion. They will be viable for the next 75 years, and by 2050, they will be worth over one thousand billion dollars. Meanwhile, private pension funds lost billions of dollars during the recession. \lineBreak Why is this government still asking Canadians to put their savings in private banks and mutual funds, rather than improving public pensions?","Mr. Speaker, I wish to welcome my new colleague across the floor. \lineBreak We are working hard to improve retirement security for Canadians. Together with the provinces, we have invested in innovative proposals aimed at improving pensions even further. However, like the provinces, we have some concerns about the NDP's proposals. I would like to quote Raymond Bachand:"
41,"Mr. Speaker, Canadian families have always been told that if they saved a little and let the market work its magic, they would have enough funds when it came time to retire, but Canadian families who lost billions of dollars during the recession see this for just what it is: smoke and mirrors. Now, instead of expanding a healthy CPP, the government is moving full steam ahead with a risky private pooled pension plan. \lineBreak Just whose side is the government on, Canadian families or their friends?","Mr. Speaker, I am happy to stand again on behalf of pensioners.  \lineBreak We have been working very hard to improve Canadians' retirement security. For instance, we reformed the framework governing federally regulated pensions to better protect pensioners. \lineBreak With the provinces, we mentioned the pooled registered pension plan. We are also looking at CPP reforms, but we and many provinces are very concerned about the proposition by the NDP to double the CPP.  \lineBreak I heard Catherine Swift of the CFIB state on CPAC just yesterday that they believe it would be a 60% to 70% increase to all businesses across the way. They are not in support of that."
42,"Mr. Speaker, the people of Moncton are shocked to learn that some very respected members of their community are facing deportation.  \lineBreak The Maeng family have put down firm roots since moving to Canada eight years ago. They have built their own business, and their eldest son is studying to become a dentist. \lineBreak However, despite having disclosed their younger son's health problems from the outset, they are now being told that his autism and epilepsy disqualify them from permanent residency. \lineBreak Will the minister commit to reviewing this troubling decision on humanitarian and compassionate grounds?","Mr. Speaker, first of all I congratulate the member on his re-election and his appointment as the immigration critic for the official opposition. \lineBreak The member knows that the minister cannot comment on particular cases because of the Privacy Act. Having said that, there is a very fair process, including access to applications for permanent residency for humanitarian and compassionate reasons by individuals. Those are not considered by elected officials but by highly trained public servants. \lineBreak I would point out that there is in our law provision for medical inadmissibility for those who the provinces deem would represent an undue burden to our tax-funded public health care system."
43,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday's budget shows no leadership on health care.  \lineBreak A 2004 health accord goal to reduce wait times calls for effective community services, including home care. After five years of Conservative government, there is still no national home care, and wait times for acute hospital beds remain unacceptably high. \lineBreak While it dithers on the 2014 accord, will the government tell us what steps it will take to implement the wait times goal and create a national home care strategy?","Mr. Speaker, in our effort to support the provinces and territories to deliver health care we have increased the transfers by 33% since we formed government. We have also sent additional funding to the provinces and territories to help with a specific wait time guarantee. A number of provinces have made improvements in important wait time areas. Recently I announced over 100 family medicine residencies for rural practice.  \lineBreak As well, our government takes concrete action to support provinces and territories in delivering health care--"
44,The member for Papineau.,"Mr. Speaker, the agreement with the provinces on health will come to an end in barely three years. For quite some time now, the premiers of Quebec and Ontario, among others, have been calling on this government to convene a meeting with all the premiers, but to no avail. In fact, in his six years on the job, the  \lineBreak When will he take his responsibility as Prime Minister seriously and initiate dialogue to plan the future of our health care system?"
45,"Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, the health accord expires in 2014; not this year, not next year, and not the year after. \lineBreak  In the meantime, our government has been working with the provinces and territories on the present accord. We have encouraged the statutory review of the 2004 accord in both the Senate and the House. As well, we have been supported by the provinces and territories in the reduction of wait times. Also, we have gained a lot of ground in establishing electronic health records. Provinces and territories continue to deliver the--",The hon. member for

47,"Mr. Speaker, we are learning today that the former parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Defence saw hope that higher unemployment would help recruiting for the Canadian Forces. It is unbelievable. \lineBreak Would the government tell the House whether it favours higher unemployment for this reason? Does this explain its lack of a proper job creation strategy?","Mr. Speaker, our job creation strategy is far-ranging. \lineBreak It includes helping small businesses by giving them incentives to hire new people. It gives them incentives to invest in new equipment to make them more productive and more competitive on the world stage. \lineBreak We are trying to help people get back to work so that Canada can be as strong as it can possibly be competing on the global stage. We need to support workers. We need to support industry so it can grow."

49,"Mr. Speaker, sadly budget 2011 is an abdication of the government's responsibilities to aboriginal peoples.  \lineBreak I ask the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is building on its impressive record in major investments and unprecedented collaboration with aboriginals to increase the educational outcome for first nations children and to address priority areas such as water and waste water infrastructure. Our current budget builds on those investments and demonstrates our strong commitment."
50,"Mr. Speaker, I did not hear an answer to the question of the $127 million being cut in this budget compared to the previous budget. Can the minister answer the question? Common courtesy in this House also means getting answers. It is only natural for the opposition to protest if it does not get an answer. Can he give us an answer regarding the $127 million in cuts to aboriginal housing? ","Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are very good at talking about process and very bad at getting concrete results. \lineBreak  We have invested major dollars during the stimulus spending program. This budget deals with the first nations land management, water, K-12, matrimonial real property and the investment in the major completion of the Dempster Highway. It had good reviews from the national aboriginal leaders. That is good for Canadians."
51,"Mr. Speaker, last week, Quebeckers and Canadians were stunned when Justice James Brunton released about 30 accused people because of the delays expected in their megatrial. The police did their job. The prosecutors did their job. It is time for Parliament to do its job. \lineBreak Would the ","First, Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member on his appointment as justice critic for the NDP.  \lineBreak This is certainly the time and it was certainly the time in the last Parliament when we introduced the fair and efficient criminal trials act that would strengthen case management, reduce duplication and improve criminal procedure. That was a great piece of legislation. We are prepared to re-introduce it. I hope it has the support of the hon. member and his colleagues."
52,"Mr. Speaker, I can assure him that, in fact, it does have the support of this party and I believe of the Liberal Party as well. It is a welcome development that we move on this. This is a problem that we have known about for several years. In the last Parliament, Bill  \lineBreak My question to the minister today is this. Will he pledge to the House that we will have the bill before the House and pass it before we leave in the spring?","That is the easiest pledge I will ever make, Mr. Speaker. We all have an interest in improving the criminal justice system and this, hopefully, portends something new in this Parliament's support for justice legislation. I can assure the hon. member that bill will be tabled forthwith."
53,"Mr. Speaker, I was much relieved to learn yesterday that the  \lineBreak  In light of the new decorum in the House, would the minister tell the House what is the specific cost of closing the base, what will be the cost of opening the base in Kuwait, and will he table those costs in the House?","Mr. Speaker, I appreciate advice from the member opposite in the Liberal Party on how to get along internally within a party. That is something I will keep very much in mind in the future.  \lineBreak However, with respect to the ongoing costs of maintaining a logistic hub in the Middle East, which is very important in supporting our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan and in fact throughout the region, there will be information forthcoming."
54,"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about employment. In 2010, the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, we certainly want to help the unemployed. That is why yesterday's budget included the initiatives I have already talked about. I can assure hon. members that we are already sending very significant sums to the Government of New Brunswick to help support the unemployed who face constraints specific to that region. I encourage them to take advantage of this."
55,"Mr. Speaker, historic floods in Montérégie will have lasting effects on our community, but we are finally beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, with this government, it is too little, too late. After more than 50 days of stress and frustration, flood victims are entitled to clear answers. \lineBreak Can the minister confirm whether soldiers will stay to help flood victims with the cleanup?","What I can confirm, Mr. Speaker, is that within 24 hours after predeploying, we had hundreds of Canadian Forces members on the ground in the region supporting the people who were suffering from this flood. \lineBreak In total, over 844 soldiers helped to protect thousands of acres of farmland. They built two major dikes that needed repair. They put 224,000 sandbags in place and helped community members. They did check visits, went to residences with assistance, water and food. This was an outstanding effort by members of the Canadian Forces."
56,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, over 50 days after the major flooding began in the Haut-Richelieu area, the  \lineBreak Since the fact that the government will assume 50% of the costs under its own cost-sharing program is not new and since the budget does not make any mention of new, additional aid, can the ","Mr. Speaker, we are pleased to work with the provinces in respect of disaster financial assistance.

New changes have been made to the disaster financial assistance agreement.  \lineBreak I note some of the  \lineBreak I look forward to working on those details with the provinces and with my colleagues in cabinet."
57,"Mr. Speaker, after months of talk about the difficulties facing seniors throughout Canada, I am clearly disappointed in budget 2011. The $1.67 a day for the poorest of the poor and non-refundable tax credits just do not cut it. \lineBreak Given the increases on gas, hydro, food, et cetera, it is making it very difficult for people to cope on a day-to-day basis and stay in their homes. I heard this on the doorsteps in Toronto, but clearly the Conservatives did not. \lineBreak Where is the vision, the plan to make a difference in the lives of seniors? Do they not deserve better?

59,"Mr. Speaker,  just a few short weeks ago, the premier of Ontario, Mr. McGuinty, made a major speech to the people of Ontario about the state of health care and his concerns about the future of the health care accord with the federal government. Premier McGuinty asked particularly that the  \lineBreak I wonder if the Prime Minister could tell the House what he intends to do to bring the provinces together to improve health care in Canada.","Mr. Speaker, of course, the health accord comes up for renewal in 2014. That is not this year or next year or even the year after that. However, I do look forward to discussing this matter with the premier of Ontario in the future, whomever that may be."
60,"Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the future starts now. Premier McGuinty is not the only one calling on the federal government to take a positive approach. All of the provinces want to see a different attitude from the federal government when it comes to health and consulting with the provinces in general. \lineBreak Why is the government intent on maintaining this unilateral federalism that does not benefit all of Canada?","Mr. Speaker, the "
61,"Mr. Speaker, the recent report of the Health Council of Canada cites lack of federal leadership for the failure to establish a national pharmaceutical strategy, which is a key goal of the 2004 health accord. Yet the budget makes no mention of this critical program. \lineBreak The success of the health accord depends on collaboration between the federal and provincial governments.  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government recognizes the importance of affordable access to drugs as part of a quality health care system, and we work with the provinces and territories, who are responsible, by the way, for deciding which drugs are publicly covered. \lineBreak That is why we have consistently increased transfers to the provinces and territories by over 30% since we formed government, so they can continue to meet the health care needs of their residents."
62,"Mr. Speaker, last night, while people around the world prepared for World Oceans Day, Canadians learned that their government was planning to slash funding for the protection and conservation of fisheries and oceans. These cuts ignore our responsibility to protect the world's longest coastline. Has the government forgotten when our fisheries were brought to the brink of disaster? \lineBreak Will the minister see reason and commit to cancelling the planned cuts to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans?","Mr. Speaker, a strategic review is an opportunity for the department to assess the performance of all of its programs. It also allows us to ensure that we are responding to the priorities of Canadians and the strong mandate that Canadians gave us. We have a responsibility to taxpayers to spend their money prudently and where it will do the most good. We must ensure that government programs are efficient, effective and achieving the expected results for Canadians. We believe that DFO is at a critical period in developing its programs and policies to meet the needs of the new fisheries and oceans management for today and the future."
63,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government is making decisions that will compromise the safety of Quebeckers. We have learned that the government will be closing maritime search and rescue centres in Quebec in order to centralize operations in Halifax. And it is all in the name of saving money instead of saving lives. \lineBreak Does the minister realize that these services that protect the public are more effective when they are provided in the region where they are needed?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, we received a strong mandate from Canadians to implement our budget proposals and deficit reduction measures. The decision to close the call centre will save taxpayer dollars without impacting the safety of people while, at the same time, still providing bilingual services. New communications technologies exist that now permit search and rescue call centre employees to provide the same high-quality service from a central call centre. Existing search and rescue helicopters and vessels will remain where they are currently based."
64,"Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke said last February that Newfoundlanders should look after themselves when it came to search and rescue, Canadians were shocked. No one realized that this would actually become Conservative government policy.  \lineBreak Closing the maritime rescue sub-centre in St. John's will endanger people's lives. Will the minister commit to reversing this dangerous decision and show he is serious about the safety of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians?","Mr. Speaker, of course, safety is a primary issue when it comes to Canadians and all of the services that we provide. This call centre reduction will in no way impact the safety of Canadians and, at the same time, will provide efficiencies as well as savings of Canadian taxpayers' money."
65,"Mr. Speaker, this is not a call centre. The St. John's maritime rescue coordination centre handles over 500 incidents a year, involving almost 3,000 people at risk. It depends on local knowledge to save 600 lives each year. \lineBreak The government has decided to spend billions on corporate tax giveaways. To pay for it, it seems willing to endanger the lives of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.  \lineBreak Will the government agree right now to reverse this most shameful decision?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, there is no way that we would make a decision that would have an impact on the safety of any Canadian.  \lineBreak Existing search and rescue resources, including helicopters and vessels, will remain where they are currently based. The call centre function can be provided from a central location, saving dollars as we exercise our commitment to Canadians to reduce our deficit."
66,"Mr. Speaker, a report by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff reveals that the government is considering reducing the number of contractors and reservists by 5% annually. During the recent campaign, the NDP committed to maintaining the National Defence budget in all regions, including mine, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. \lineBreak Can the Conservatives do this and still assure Canadian Forces members and civilian staff in Bagotville that they will not be affected by these cuts? ","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. \lineBreak I would like to remind the House of this government's record: over the past five years, the defence budget was increased by at least $1 billion a year, and reservists and civilian staff are included in that budget. \lineBreak Of course, there will be operational cuts in this year's budget, but that growth and those increases remain part of this government's record and we are very proud of it."
67,"Mr. Speaker, my question is also about the government's threat to cut defence jobs across the country. \lineBreak In my riding, there are more than 6,000 regular and reserve officers and more than 2,500 civilians who serve our country every day at CFB Esquimalt. This base contributes over $600 million a year to our regional economy. \lineBreak Will the government commit today to stopping these defence cuts that are creating so much uncertainty in my community? Will the government assure the House that no cuts will be made that would affect the operations of our six coastal defence vessels based at Esquimalt?","Mr. Speaker, our government's record on national defence speaks for itself. On average, the budget for this important department has risen by $1 billion every year since 2006. \lineBreak Obviously, just as Canadians are tightening their belts with regard to the situation this country faced in the global downturn, and as this government moves to achieve operational efficiencies, there will be a strategic review of some costs in National Defence and they will be reported to the House in due course."
68,"Mr. Speaker, nearly 7,000 civilian and military personnel at CFB Valcartier want to know if the Conservatives plan to cut their budget. While several regions of Canada desperately need help from our soldiers, particularly to deal with natural disasters, the soldiers themselves are dealing with limited human and material resources.  \lineBreak How can the government even consider more cuts? Can the ","Mr. Speaker, once again, in the context of the strategic review of government spending, of course there will be cuts to the National Defence operating budget. \lineBreak However, for this important department, the facts speak for themselves: an additional $1 billion in spending every year since 2006 is the most important part of this government's record when it comes to National Defence."
69,"Mr. Speaker, the fight for a climate change plan in Canada has an unlikely ally, the loyal executives at Suncor. They agree that the government's piecemeal approach to regulating emissions is expensive and ineffective. \lineBreak The government has always had an open door policy for oil executives. Will the minister now commit to dropping his expensive and ineffective approach and introduce a legally binding plan to combat emissions?","Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that my colleague is expressing concern for a fine Alberta industry that creates so many jobs and generates such great wealth for the Canadian economy. \lineBreak As my colleague knows full well, we have a plan and the plan is working. We addressed transportation emissions first. We moved on to the coal-fired electricity generating sector, and we are about to begin consultations with other heavy emitters, including the oil and gas sector."
70,"Mr. Speaker, the government does not understand that its plan is a failure. Canada is far from meeting its international commitments on climate change. In fact, Canada will not even meet its own targets. And to think that most federal greenhouse gas reduction programs will end in 2012. \lineBreak When will we have a long-term plan to fight climate change?","Mr. Speaker, that is simply not true. \lineBreak We have a plan and that plan is working. Indeed, the emissions are getting heavier. What we will do to deal with that is to decouple the increase in emissions from the productivity and profitability of the various resource generation sectors. \lineBreak We have a plan. We are a quarter of our way toward achieving our 2020 goals. We will meet those targets."
71,"Mr. Speaker, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has rejected the Keystone XL pipeline study and considers it to be, and I quote, “inadequate”. Close to one million more barrels of crude oil will be transported by this pipeline. According to the agency, this will increase greenhouse gas emissions associated with the oil sands. \lineBreak Can the minister confirm these facts and provide any studies on greenhouse gas emissions and the Keystone pipeline?","Mr. Speaker, the National Energy Board is a strong independent regulator that ensures pipeline safety. It is mandated to ensure the safety and the security of pipelines from when they are first proposed until they are abandoned. \lineBreak Canada and the U.S. trade oil, natural gas and electricity across our boarders every day. The Keystone XL pipeline will provide a substantial economic benefit to Canada."
72,"Mr. Speaker, the government just does not get it. Canada has lost its credibility. The U.S.A. is doing more due diligence on greenhouse gases from Canada's oil sands than the Canadian government has done in five years. \lineBreak Instead of hiring PR teams to give a good name to the oil sands abroad, will the government regulate absolute reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands?","Mr. Speaker, that is a mixed question with a couple of subjects there. \lineBreak While the opposition continues to bash Canada abroad and here in terms of the way we handle energy, our government will continue to defend the Canadian economy, continue to defend Canadian resources and continue to defend Canadian jobs, and we will not apologize for it."
73,"Mr. Speaker, today marks World Oceans Day, a time when we recognize the importance of maintaining the health of a marine environment and its resources. The Conservative government takes this issue very seriously. We are committed to the preservation of Canada's fragile ocean environment. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for  \lineBreak Healthy oceans and their role in the economic and social life for our country are critically important. This is why earlier today I was pleased to announce three new candidate marine protected areas on the east coast and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, as well as a strategy for protecting the important corals and sponge reefs on our Pacific coast.  \lineBreak Today's announcements complement the eight marine areas which the government has protected since 2006, as well as our investments in science, the Coast Guard and sustainable fisheries."
74,"Mr. Speaker, the federal government's plan to help the residents of the Montérégie region in dealing with the flooding has been, in a word, pathetic. \lineBreak After withdrawing the troops on the eve of floods becoming worse, the public safety minister said in a letter that the army could not stay there for the cleanup because, and get this, it would be unfair competition for the private sector. \lineBreak Will the government finally accept Quebec's request to have troops assist volunteers and residents to clean up from this historic disaster?","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Forces are on the ground within 24 hours of each provincial request. Over 800 soldiers, sailors and air personnel have helped with dyke reinforcement, sandbagging, protection of infrastructure and houses, maintenance of the central roads and evacuations of civilians from flood ravaged areas.  \lineBreak The Canadian Forces have worked side-by-side with the provincial authorities during these crises to protect our citizens, property and infrastructure. The Canadian Forces is always ready to step in in response to emergencies."
75,"Mr. Speaker, this weekend, thousands of Quebeckers will converge on Saint-Jean to help the disaster victims. This solidarity was also part of what we experienced during the Saguenay floods and the ice storm. Unfortunately, it is not shared by the Conservative government, even though it is responsible for representing all Canadians, including Quebeckers who voted for the NDP. \lineBreak Will the government stand in solidarity with the disaster victims and allow Canadian troops to help with the cleanup?","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Forces will remain in these regions during these emergencies to assist civil authorities until their unique capabilities are no longer required. \lineBreak Every member of the House should be proud of the outstanding job the Canadian Forces have done in Quebec, in Manitoba and, most recently, in Saskatchewan to protect Canadians in danger."
76,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Forming government with the support of only 24% of Canadians eligible to vote does not constitute the plebiscite set out in the act. \lineBreak Why does he refuse to ask the very people who will be devastated by his decision if they support the Wheat Board's demise? What is the minister afraid of? Why does he plan to ignore the law?","Mr. Speaker, western Canadian farmers gave us a strong mandate to move forward in this direction. I cannot understand why the member for "

Chief Noskey has requested federal support for independent expertise on damage assessment and remediation.  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, obviously our departmental officials have been in contact with and working with the leadership of the Lubicon first nation. I would also like to point out that we have done much in the way of water and water regulations. We have done most of that work through working with the Alberta treaty first nations and we will continue to do so."
78,"Mr. Speaker, the Mackenzie River Basin is home to countless first nations and Métis communities. They rely on the basin for sustenance and transport. Both the Northwest Territories government and the Dene Nation have raised concerns about transboundary impacts of this spill and of oil sands developments in the basin.  \lineBreak As the government is mandated to guard the rights and interests of aboriginal peoples and to address transboundary impacts, when can we finally expect to see federal leadership on the Mackenzie River Basin Agreement?","Once again, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the critic in the NDP. I did not welcome her and I look forward to our upcoming meeting. \lineBreak The progress on that initiative is going forward. I have had contact and an early briefing on that.

80,"Mr. Speaker, I used to work with small businesses who helped people save energy and money in their homes. They would be disappointed by the non-answer given Tuesday in response to a question about the eco-energy retrofit program for homes. Here is a program the government cut and brought back and cut and brought back. People cannot run small businesses that way. \lineBreak Since the Conservatives claim to care so much about stability, why do they not stay true to their words and help small businesses by committing to make this program stable for five years instead of just one year?","Mr. Speaker, we are proud of the $10 billion investment that our government has invested in clean energy and a cleaner environment. We are proud of the eco-energy program. It is helping thousands of homeowners across the country make their homes more efficient and it has helped small businesses across the country as well.  \lineBreak We are very proud of the significant investments that we continue to make in clean energy, which is supporting renewable energy development across this country."

Experts found that there is an urgent need to replace it and to include a sustainable transportation system for the future. Yet nothing is being done. There is no money in the budget for this and there is no plan. Everyone is wondering when the needs of the south shore will be met. \lineBreak When will the government finally announce the construction of a new bridge that includes sustainable transportation, such as a light rail system? ","Mr. Speaker, our government is well aware of the importance of this file to the greater Montreal area. \lineBreak First, I will ask the hon. member to carefully reread the budget. In fact, $228 million has been allocated for bridges in the Montreal area. So, if the future of the Champlain Bridge is so important to him, he should vote in favour of the budget."
82,"Mr. Speaker, today politicians of the European Union passed a motion calling on Canada to drop the World Trade Organization challenge against their unfair and improper ban on Canadian seal products. We also know our challenge at the WTO regarding seal products is about protecting and advancing the financial security of Canadians.  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, first of all, allow me to congratulate the member for  \lineBreak Canada's position on seals is a completely separate matter from ongoing negotiations with the European Union over our comprehensive economic trade agreement. Furthermore, the EU ban on virtually all Canadian seal products is inconsistent with the EU's international trade obligations. That is why the Canadian government has initiated the WTO dispute settlement process and we will be moving ahead with our WTO challenge."

That said, we have an extremely fair process for asylum seekers that has a number of levels of appeal, including the ability to apply to become a permanent resident on humanitarian grounds. I imagine that this family has gone through all of those steps, but our system must treat every case fairly, and that is what we are doing."
84,"Mr. Speaker, Canada Post has rejected the union's latest offer to settle the dispute and as the pressure tactics continue, the government's silence on the matter is worrisome. \lineBreak Does the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation not realize that with his silence he is condoning the actions of Canada Post, when he should instead be sending a clear message that the government also expects a negotiated solution, which is the only way this public service might be enhanced, including in small communities?","Mr. Speaker, indeed we have been there. We have had mediators at the table with the two parties encouraging them to resolve their dispute. Oftentimes the best results to these situations of dispute are found between the parties.  \lineBreak We are very frustrated that it is continuing on, so we have put more effort and emphasis on making sure that the parties themselves know the importance of this matter to the Canadian public. \lineBreak I have met with the president of Canada Post and with the president of the union. We continue to encourage them to get a deal done."
85,"Mr. Speaker, the Champlain Bridge problem deserves to be taken seriously. The bridge is regularly partially closed and as a result Quebeckers spend more time on the road, arrive late for work and lose precious time with their families. It is a veritable nightmare. This situation is wasting Quebeckers' time and money. In the Conservative budget, replacing the Champlain Bridge was totally ignored.  \lineBreak Will this government stand up for Quebeckers once and for all? Can the minister immediately commit to providing the necessary funding for replacing the Champlain Bridge?","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his question. He has been a member of Parliament for the Montreal area for many years. In fact, the Liberals were in government for many years and could have started the work. \lineBreak We have started the work. We have invested several million dollars to repair the bridge and to continue to ensure the safety of the bridge. In this week's budget, we announced $228 million for continuing the work. What is more, all the options are on the table."
86,"Mr. Speaker, farmers in Ontario have the right to vote. \lineBreak After four years of study, a federal rail service review reported last October that shippers of grain, forest products and other commodities are getting seriously inferior services. The problem is an imbalance in market power, which strongly favours the railways. \lineBreak After a further delay of six months, the government agreed last March to correct that imbalance. It only takes a simple amendment to the Canada Transportation Act but the throne speech was oddly silent on that issue. \lineBreak Will the government commit unequivocally to enact that new legislation before the end of this calendar year?","Mr. Speaker, we are currently working on moving ahead with these recommendations. The safety of all transportation in the country is a major priority for our government and, as usual, we will deliver the goods."
87,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General explained at length how lucrative it is to be friends with a Conservative minister. For example, the former industry minister sat down with two friends to share tens of millions of dollars. There were no witnesses, no documentation, no records. The auditor himself said that he has never seen anything like it and that he is scandalized. Is this sponsorship scandal 2.0? \lineBreak How is it that, with such a poor track record, this same minister is now responsible for budget cuts?","Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, these municipal projects were actually approved by the federal government and the municipalities. All of these projects were announced publicly and appear on the website. However, the Auditor General made several recommendations to improve the process in the future and we accept all of those recommendations. "
88,"Mr. Speaker, considerable sums of money were divided and allocated by the three wise men of Deerhurst. \lineBreak There has been no accountability, no transparency and no rationale for decisions, which for the most part were completely unrelated to the stated objective. \lineBreak This is truly the Liberal way of Chuck Guité and Alfonso Gagliano. \lineBreak How could the ","Mr. Speaker, the NDP member's statements are entirely false. The reality is that these 32 projects were published. They are on the website. Every dollar was accounted for by this government. As I said before, the Auditor General made several recommendations to improve the process in the future and we accept those recommendations."
89,"Mr. Speaker, it was the interim Auditor General himself who explained that the Conservative government kept Parliament completely in the dark and that the Conservatives misled Parliament not once but twice. The government approved millions of dollars in funding for border infrastructure but this funding was diverted to boondoggle projects hundreds of kilometres from the nearest border. \lineBreak We want a clear answer to just one example. What does the restoration of a steamboat in the minister's riding have to do with the G8 summit or border infrastructure?","Mr. Speaker, that program was announced publicly. The projects were published. In fact, we held debates on this issue several times here in the House of Commons. That being said, the Auditor General recommended changes to the estimates process to improve transparency, and the government will accept those recommendations."
90,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General revealed today that Treasury Board allowed the former minister of industry to set up a $47 million slush fund for pork barrel projects in his riding. Here is how it went down: there was the minister, there was a mayor and there was a hotel manager who dished out the loot. There was no oversight, no documentation and no questions asked. This is just one step up from cash in a brown paper bag. \lineBreak Is this how the minister will plan to run the Treasury Board?","Mr. Speaker, so much for the civility that the  \lineBreak At the outset, I want to thank the outgoing Auditor General, Sheila Fraser, not just for this audit but for her outstanding years of public service to Canadians.  \lineBreak I completely reject the premise of the question by the member opposite. The decisions for the funding of these 32 public infrastructure projects were made by me in my time as minister of infrastructure, not by the current president of the Treasury Board."
91,"Mr. Speaker, there is nothing civil about the abuse of taxpayers' trust. The Conservatives misled Parliament. They told us that they were requesting money for border infrastructure and they fuddled it off for pork-barrel projects, such as gazebos, steamboats and everything else the minister could think of. This is the kind of rum bottle, pork barrel politics that Canadians are fed up with. \lineBreak Will the minister apologize to the taxpayers for this abuse of our public trust?","Mr. Speaker, my colleague from "
92,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak The simple fact is that the government used that money for a completely different purpose. Huntsville is 300 miles away from the closest border in Niagara Falls. How does he explain this bait and switch?","Mr. Speaker, if the leader of the Liberal Party had looked at the border fund he would have realized that it is frequently used for projects that are not in border communities. \lineBreak In any case, this program was announced publicly by the government. It was well-known by Parliament. In fact, it was debated several times here in the House of Commons. \lineBreak The Auditor General, like the leader of the Liberal Party, has made observations on the transparency of the estimates process. There are some improvements that could be made there and we will accept those recommendations."
93,"Mr. Speaker, the G20 was announced for downtown Toronto with just four months warning. Toronto businesses were given little notice and almost no information. Toronto shop owners lost millions from the G20 but the government dragged its heels on compensation and then wrapped the process in red tape. A year later, they are still waiting. \lineBreak When will Toronto businesses be fully and properly compensated for damages and lost revenue from the G20 calamity?","Mr. Speaker, let me take this occasion to congratulate my friend, the member for  \lineBreak The government has a standard plan to provide assistance to those people who suffered damages through no fault of their own. With respect to the city of Toronto and the G20, that applies. I would be very pleased to work with her to expedite the consideration and finalization of any of these initiatives. "
94,"Mr. Speaker, when it came to spending $14,000 for glow sticks, Conservatives said, “full steam ahead”; $300,000 on bug spray, a green light, but for close to $50 million, what did Toronto get? Broken glass, a fake lake and the biggest mass arrest in Canadian history. \lineBreak The message is clear. Toronto is at the bottom of the government's priority list. Again, why is the government refusing to fairly compensate Toronto's small businesses? ","Mr. Speaker, let me first congratulate the member opposite on his election to Parliament. We are certainly very committed to work with members opposite and small business people in the city of Toronto to ensure that all compensation that is fair and reasonable and meets the guidelines that the department has in place is paid in as expeditious way as possible. \lineBreak With respect to the budget, we had men and women of the Canadian Forces, who were out in Muskoka on evenings where there was a considerable amount of potential harm, and that is where that expenditure came down."
95,"Mr. Speaker, today the Auditor General reported on the abject failure over the past decade by the current and former federal governments to address 15 of her most critical recommendations for first nations. In fact, today's audit reveals worsening conditions for first nation reserve housing, schools and drinking water, a disparity, in the words of Sheila Fraser, unacceptable in a country as rich as Canada. \lineBreak Will the government today commit to expedited action on the needed laws, measures and dollars to right these wrongs?","Mr. Speaker, the government always takes the Auditor General's advice very seriously. The Auditor General's report focuses on what has already happened. We are looking to the future, developing partnerships with aboriginal people across Canada. We have made progress and we are achieving concrete results. \lineBreak We recognize that more needs to be done. We are in a new phase. This morning the National Chief and I announced a joint action plan on priority areas: education, good governance, economic development, negotiation and implementation. \lineBreak We have a plan. We work in collaboration and we are results-oriented."
96,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General explained today in her report that the state of the first nations reserves is at a point of no return.  \lineBreak If a reserve has a serious mould problem threatening the health of the community, what does the government do? It sends a pamphlet. Such absurdity has been going on for eight years. \lineBreak The Auditor General is asking that these problems be addressed through sweeping changes. \lineBreak What can the government tell us about its plan to resolve these structural problems on the reserves?","Mr. Speaker, as I explained previously, we have announced a joint action plan with the national chief this morning.  \lineBreak We are moving from reconciliation, where we have made major progress, into a prosperity agenda. We have agreed on joint priority areas and we will work in collaboration with willing partners because we take the business of getting results very seriously."
97,"Mr. Speaker, while the Conservatives talk tough, today's AG report reveals that the RCMP is crippled by underfunding and it does not have enough resources to fight organized crime. \lineBreak Communities across Canada, both urban and rural, are struggling against organized crime and gang violence. I have seen it in my own community. The RCMP is supposed to be there to protect Canadians and stop these criminals. \lineBreak Could the minister explain how underfunding the RCMP is making communities across Canada a safer place for families?","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that the NDP members have an interest in criminal issues. It remains to be seen whether they will support some of our initiatives that we need to proceed with in order to make streets safe, including the member's riding.  \lineBreak I read with interest the Auditor General's comments regarding national police services and we fully accept recommendations made by her in the report. I have asked the RCMP to put together a management action plan to address the recommendations made by the Auditor General."
98,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have forgotten about my former colleagues in the Canadian armed forces reserve. Nearly 10 years after the government began implementing a plan for buying back pensions, the plan is only 4% complete. Reservists will have to wait up to seven years to get information about their pension. \lineBreak What is more, the defence department tried to fix the situation, but it still became worse.  \lineBreak Will the government recognize that it failed on this issue and fix the problem once and for all?","Mr. Speaker, our reservists are a key part of our Canadian Forces. And not just the forces' past, but also their present and their future: 20% of our forces deployed in Afghanistan are reservists. Our government was proud to be the first in 40 years to implement a new pension plan for reservists in 2007."
99,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's contribution to the mission in Libya was authorized by Parliament within a clear United Nations mandate: to protect civilians, to enforce a no-fly zone and to obtain a ceasefire.  \lineBreak In light of contradictory public comments by the ","Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that the motion that the government will put forward next week will be to renew the current existing defence mandate, which will be to protect civilians. We will continue to work within the United Nations framework in that regard.  \lineBreak We will continue with the current military mission that we sought approval for from Parliament."
100,"Mr. Speaker, part of this issue is around diplomacy.  \lineBreak Today's meeting with the Libya contact group brings together different ministers, top diplomats from around the world, including the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It should be an opportunity for Canada to show leadership in diplomacy. \lineBreak Will the government commit to expanding regional diplomacy so we can see an end to the crisis in Libya?","Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree that Canada can play a robust role with the Libyan contact group. My cabinet colleague is representing Canada at that very important meeting today. \lineBreak Diplomatically we have to work with our partners in the United Nations, our Arab partners in the region, to not just effect a military mission but also to be diplomatically engaged on humanitarian and development efforts.  \lineBreak Canada, as well as our allies, should have greater engagement with the transitional council in Benghazi."
101,"Mr. Speaker, in certain areas of Libya, food and medication are becoming scarce. So far, barely half of the humanitarian aid requested by the UN has been delivered. \lineBreak Will this government commit to proposing an increase in humanitarian aid as an integral part of its proposal to extend the mission in Libya?","Mr. Speaker, the crisis in Libya is concerning. The situation continues to be volatile, which greatly limits humanitarian access to the country. \lineBreak In response, Canada provided food for one million displaced Libyans, tents and supplies to 90,000 Libyans, as well as medical supplies and care.  \lineBreak We continue to work with our international partners to monitor the humanitarian situation as it develops."
102,"Mr. Speaker, whether it is trying to de-staff lighthouses or refusing to put money into search and rescue in Newfoundland and Labrador, the government seems willing to put the lives of people at risk. Fishers and oil workers in particular work in a risky environment and the last thing they need is to worry about their safety because of this move.  \lineBreak The location and the knowledge of the 12 people who work at the safety centre are instrumental in avoiding tragedies. It is not a call centre. \lineBreak How can the government waste millions on fake lakes and gazebos and then cut money from lifesaving search and rescue?","Mr. Speaker, we are acting on the strong mandate that we received from Canadians to implement our budget proposals and deficit reduction measures. \lineBreak I have been very clear all along that safety and operational needs will not be compromised by the consolidation of these call centres. All vessels and helicopters will stay where they are. Coast Guard employees will continue to live up to their reputation of excellence while performing their duties."
103,"Mr. Speaker, if this government is so proud of its record in terms of the fight against HIV-AIDS, why is it refusing to participate in the UN summit currently taking place in New York? After 30 years, we still have a long way to go to eliminate this disease. By refusing to take action, this government is playing with the health and lives of millions of people in Canada and around the world. This is another black eye for Canada on the international stage. \lineBreak Can the minister tell us when she intends to show some leadership on this issue?","Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work our government has accomplished in helping combat HIV-AIDS not only in Canada but also in the developing world. \lineBreak The Canadian HIV vaccine initiative, led by our government along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, highlights Canada's world-class HIV vaccine research expertise and this initiative will help our government advance the science for the development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine."
104,"Mr. Speaker, if the minister is so proud of her work on HIV-AIDS, then why is she hiding from this major meeting? This international gathering is about the future of the fight against HIV-AIDS, but the minister has effectively removed Canada from any leading role in fighting this global epidemic. \lineBreak  If the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, Canada is a world leader in establishing the HIV vaccine initiative globally in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This is not just with Canada but many other countries are involved in the same project. \lineBreak In addition, last year alone our government provided $42 million in HIV-AIDS research funding through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, which partners not only with Canadian researchers but also the global community."
105,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and Canada Post are presently renegotiating their collective agreement. During this negotiation, Canada Post went ahead and terminated both disability and long-term illness insurance, which workers are entitled to receive. Without it, they will be left with no source of income. What a shame. \lineBreak Canada Post has no compassion. Will the minister responsible for Canada Post tell it to be humane and restore the benefits workers received before the cancellation? What a shame.","Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite knows, right now both the union and management are sitting at a negotiating table trying to sort out their differences, trying to get a deal, so the Canadian public is no longer affected either by rotating strikes or infrequent mail delivery. I urge him to work with me in order to encourage the parties to come to a deal."
106,"Mr. Speaker, we do not make cuts to disabled people and people who are ill. \lineBreak The Canada Post Corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers agreed to allow me —as the official opposition's labour critic—to visit the distribution centre in Laval and the Léo Blanchette plant in Montreal. On Thursday, they did an about-face and refused to grant me access to the facilities. \lineBreak Can the minister responsible for Canada Post tell me if they have something to hide?","Mr. Speaker, Canada Post has indicated to the member that it is willing to provide the tour once the logistical arrangements can be made. The member knows that we want to work with all parties to ensure Canadians get the best service possible. I look forward to the member seeing the facility and working with Canada Post to ensure that tour occurs when the logistics permit it."
107,"Mr. Speaker, as I rise for the first time in this House, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the residents of Richmond Hill for the confidence they have placed in me. \lineBreak Canada has played a leadership role at NATO in the defence of innocent civilians in Libya. We have had reports of the good work of our air force and the work of our sailors on ","Mr. Speaker, Canada has indeed taken a leadership role in helping to protect innocent civilians in Libya from the Gadhafi regime that continues to attack them. The member is correct about a forthcoming debate. He will be interested to know that the cost to date, as of June 2 of the mission, was $26 million. The incremental costs associated with this mission in coming months will be approximately $10 million per month. \lineBreak  We are extremely proud of the work of Canadian forces members who have been so courageous in reducing the ability of the Gadhafi regime to threaten its own people."
108,"Mr. Speaker, everywhere Canadians turn these days they are getting gouged. The latest proof is an OECD report which shows that Canadians pay some of the highest cellphone fees in the world. In fact, our roaming rates are more than double the OECD average. \lineBreak Does the minister understand the effects this is having on Canadian cellphone users? When will this minister act?","Mr. Speaker, it is important to ensure that there is healthy competition in Canada. The right decisions will be made in due course, but we want the services offered to be acceptable to Canadian consumers, and that requires healthy competition. "
109,"Mr. Speaker, the cellphone companies are taking advantage of the government's slack regulations. A Telus executive even admitted Telus could cut its roaming charges in half and still be profitable. Canadians are paying double what our neighbours to the south are.  \lineBreak Will the minister commit to taking the necessary steps to stop this unjustifiable gouging by cellphone companies?","Mr. Speaker, we want to provide good competition for the consumer. Down the road, we want consumers to have the choice to pick the cellphone they want. For this, we hope to have the support of the opposition parties to move forward on reforms to come."
110,"Mr. Speaker, since 2004, personal debt in Canada has increased by 40% and is at an all-time high. In Quebec alone, between 15% to 20% of credit card holders can only make the minimum payment. Families are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. They need help. However, the Conservatives have decided to help someone: the big banks. In the meantime, the Government of Quebec is taking action to protect consumers. \lineBreak Where is the leadership from the federal government?","Mr. Speaker, for some years now we have heard the concerns expressed, and we have certainly expressed them, with respect to the level of consumer debt. That is why we have taken several steps. Three times we have intervened with respect to the insured residential mortgage market, including this year.  \lineBreak We also created the code of conduct in co-operation with small business in Canada and small retailers. They have praised that code of conduct with respect to credit cards because it is working."
111,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of Quebec has just announced concrete measures to protect families and consumers. Similar measures could be taken by the Conservative government. It could choose to defend families against the voracious appetite of the credit companies, cap credit card interest rates, give financial authorities the power to prohibit excessive fees, and abolish transaction fees that are unfair to consumers and businesses. \lineBreak When will the government finally take care of consumers?","As I said, Mr. Speaker, the code of conduct that we developed was done together with small business and consumer groups. It was welcomed by small business and consumer groups.  \lineBreak Unfortunately, the opposition NDP voted against the code, but I gather from the question that I have just heard from the learned member of the NDP that this position will be changing and that he will be supporting our policy on the code of conduct."
112,"Mr. Speaker, conceivably they could be done through a telephone conference call, but G8 and G20 summits are held, supposedly, to demonstrate to the world collective leadership forged from the rule of law and global stability created by fiscal prudence and respect for democratic institutions. Canada's G8 and G20 legacy? It was a showcase of unfettered and unaffordable spending, self-indulgent decision-making, and deception of democracy and institutions of democracy to arrive at that lavishness. It was quite a beacon to the world. \lineBreak If the government could do it all over again, could it show some contrition and tell Canadians now that it would do it very differently?","Mr. Speaker, the initial authorizations for funds to these unprecedented back-to-back summits was some $1.1 billion and we learned from the Auditor General today that they came in almost 40% under budget. \lineBreak The real lasting legacy of the G8 and G20 summits in Canada is the leadership of the "
113,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives promised that there would not be any political interference in the $35 billion program for the shipbuilding industry, but the cat has been let out of the bag. Several prominent Conservatives met with lobbyists from Vancouver Shipyards and Irving Shipbuilding last fall. That can only lead to political interference. \lineBreak Why did the Conservatives break their promise?","Mr. Speaker, I can reassure the member that this is an arm's length process that is actually managed by the shipbuilding secretariat. It is the one that will be evaluating the bids and determining the winners based on the merits of the proposals. In fact, the federal cabinet will not be involved in this decision. \lineBreak The procurement is also under the careful watch of two high level interdepartmental governance committees, a fairness monitor, an international third-party benchmarking expert, and an independent validation oversight firm, KPMG. So far, the fairness monitor has told me that the process has proceeded fairly."
114,"Mr. Speaker, the minister cannot say we are going to have an open and transparent process while at the same time many of her Conservative colleagues are meeting with lobbyists when it comes to the shipbuilding industry. \lineBreak The NDP has advocated for many years for a national shipbuilding strategy based on openness and transparency, and on the best business case plan. We cannot have Conservative members of Parliament meeting with lobbyists when the minister herself told a CANSEC meeting that lobbyists were to back off. \lineBreak My question to the minister is quite clear. Why the different messaging here? Is she now going to tell these Conservative members of Parliament to butt out of the system and have a true and open policy?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, I can reassure the member that this is an arm's-length process. \lineBreak It is managed by the shipbuilding secretariat. It is in fact the one who will evaluate the bids based on merit and announce the winners. The federal cabinet will not be involved in this decision. \lineBreak I can reassure the member by providing him with the quote from the independent fairness monitor that is overseeing this process. He said that so far decisions are made objectively, free from personal favouritism and political influence, and encompasses the elements of openness, competitiveness, transparency and compliance. We will keep it that way."
115,"Mr. Speaker, June 11 is the third anniversary of the historic apology to aboriginals for residential schools. It was one of the many steps that this government has taken on a path of reconciliation with aboriginal Canadians.  \lineBreak Could the minister tell this House what the latest step is in developing the constructive and mutually beneficial relationship?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for the steps he has taken to improve the lives of Canadians living on reserve. \lineBreak Today I was proud to announce, with the national chief, a joint action plan with my department and the Assembly of First Nations. This is a practical, focused plan to improve the lives of first nations people across Canada. \lineBreak The action plan is a prosperity agenda that targets four shared priorities: education, good governance, economic development, and negotiation and implementation. We are embarking on a new phase."
116,"Mr. Speaker, the government was required to submit two greenhouse gas emissions reports in the last month, one to the UN and one to Parliament. \lineBreak The government told the UN that its climate change policies are up to 10 times more effective than what it told Parliament. The government is telling the UN one thing, while telling Parliament another. \lineBreak Will the minister tell us which report is accurate and who ordered the changes?","Mr. Speaker, the two reports are based on two different compilations of data. With regard to the inventory report to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, we reported that in 2009 the oil sands contributed 6.5% of Canada's total emissions. As reported, this fact is accurate."
117,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday at the climate change conference in Bonn, government representatives announced, and I quote, “Now that we've finished our election...Canada will not be taking a target under a second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol.” \lineBreak Once again, Canada is trying to hamper the efforts of the international community. \lineBreak Why did the government go to Bonn? To fight climate change or simply to collect fossil awards? ","Mr. Speaker, the assumption in the question is absolutely false. \lineBreak The only way to achieve real reductions in global emissions is to have a treaty that covers all emitters. The Kyoto protocol fails to do that. Therefore, Canada will not be party to a target under a second commitment period under the Kyoto protocol. \lineBreak  The Cancun agreements based on Copenhagen, on the other hand, form a solid basis for an effective global post-2012 regime that will include all major emitters."
118,"Mr. Speaker, in the recent Speech from the Throne Canadians heard that our strong, stable, national Conservative majority government will address the problem of violence against women and girls. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, since taking office, our government has invested more than $30 million in projects to end violence against women and girls all across this country, in addition to the $10 million we are investing to address the very difficult issue of murdered and missing aboriginal women. To date, we have increased funding to end violence against women and girls to its highest level ever. \lineBreak We have raised the penalties for violent sexual crimes and we have raised the age of sexual consent from 14 years old to 16 years old to protect girls from sexual exploitation by adult predators. \lineBreak We will continue to address the issue of violence against women and girls."
119,"Mr. Speaker, the government had no problem finding a whopping $668 million for the G8 summit and it had no problem finding $50 million for perks in the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is the one that has been doing the most to help seniors afford the necessities of life and go beyond that. That is why we increased the age credit, not once but twice. We introduced pension income splitting for seniors. We have launched a whole program to help fight financial abuse. \lineBreak Unfortunately, the hon. member and her party voted against every one of these initiatives to help our seniors."
120,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak The budgets of 2009 and 2010 in the Budget Implementation Acts, as we all know, became omnibus bills in which unrelated measures were included. \lineBreak I would be very grateful if the ","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on her election to the House of Commons. I regret that it means we do not have with us any more our dear friend Gary Lunn. I do not know what the member opposite has against munchkins but I am a member of that brotherhood.  \lineBreak We like this budget so much we introduced it twice. I can assure the hon. member that the budget implementation act will, of course, reflect items from the budget that are referenced in the budget. \lineBreak The GIS payments for seniors, in particular, are very important. We want to get those cheques out in July."

122,"Mr. Speaker, the throne speech is a window on the government's priorities. In last Friday's throne speech, not a single word was said about bilingualism, official languages or Canada's linguistic duality. People can draw whatever conclusions they wish. My question is for the President of the Treasury Board, who will be the one to slash public services.  \lineBreak Since the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality is his government's initiative and was just created in 2008, is he willing to promise here today that his government will not cut contributions to official language minority communities identified in the roadmap? ","Mr. Speaker, our roadmap for official languages is a five-year agreement. Our commitment to official languages has been clear since our government's first two terms, and remains clear for the third. \lineBreak Lastly, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague from "
123,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President of the Treasury Board raised the possibility of charging new user fees, but he is hiding the details. \lineBreak Does this mean there will be processing fees for employment insurance and pensions, or a filing fee at the Canada Revenue Agency—a tax on taxes, in other words? Let us be frank: a user fee is a tax, is it not?","Mr. Speaker, none of that is part of our plan. Indeed, Canadians gave us a strong mandate to keep taxes low, to balance the budget by 2014-15 and over the next year we are going to get the waste out of government and conduct a strategic and operating review of all programs.  \lineBreak The purpose of this exercise is not to look at new user fees. In fact, we will find savings so we can pay down the debt and invest in the priorities of Canadians."
124,"Mr. Speaker, since this is my first opportunity to ask this traditional question, I want to assure the  \lineBreak That said, could he inform the House as to what business we can expect next week?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome everyone back and congratulate all members on their election or re-election. I would also like to take this opportunity to specifically congratulate the member for  \lineBreak I am pleased to answer the first Thursday question of the 41st Parliament and to outline to this House our government's agenda as we carry out the strong mandate Canadians gave us on May 2. \lineBreak Today, we will continue to debate the budget, the next phase of Canada's economic action plan, a low tax plan for jobs and growth. \lineBreak  Monday, June 13, will be the final day of debate on the budget, followed by votes on the NDP amendment and the main motion. Under the order adopted this morning, we will also vote on a ways and means motion that night, which will allow the government to introduce a budget implementation bill which we will hope to debate later in the week. That bill will contain some positive measures of the low tax plan for jobs and growth, including an increase to the guaranteed income supplement for Canada's most vulnerable seniors. I look forward to the opposition party's support to pass this bill in a timely manner. \lineBreak On Tuesday, the House will debate a motion regarding Canada's involvement in the NATO-led mission in Libya. \lineBreak The House will be adjourned both this Friday and next Friday, June 17, for the Conservative and NDP conventions, as is the customary practice of the House for political party conventions."
125,"Mr. Speaker, the lack of transparency continues. My colleague from  \lineBreak If the government is not processing sponsorships for parents coming in from other countries, why does it not have the human decency to tell Canadians and applicants that is what it is doing, instead of this subterfuge it is putting forward?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the leader of the Liberal Party that he is wrong. Through our government plans, we have actually increased the number of newcomers through family reunification this year. We have increased it over the last number of years. \lineBreak  He and his party have their facts incorrect. When it comes to family reunification, it is this government, this party, that is on the right track."
126,"Mr. Speaker, according to today's Auditor General's report of first nations on reserve, under the Conservative watch the education gap has widened, the housing shortage has increased, and half of the drinking water systems on reserves still pose a significant risk to their communities. \lineBreak The minister just said he is interested in real results. Will he tell the House when 100% of first nations will have adequate housing, when 100% will have safe drinking water, and when 100% of aboriginal youth will have the same educational opportunities as the rest of Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I was interested in the comments made by the Auditor General. He said that the first nations are going to have to work closely with government to address some of these impediments and some of these fundamental issues. He said that the openness is there on both parties to deal with some of these fundamental challenges because if we are going to significantly improve the condition on first nations reserves, we need to do this. \lineBreak I agree with his commentary. That is why we announced a joint action plan with the national chief this morning."
127,"Mr. Speaker, Canada is involved in the conflict in Libya, and the government will ask Parliament to extend the commitment of our armed forces. As we prepare to debate and vote, the  \lineBreak First, is the objective of the mission in Libya still to protect civilians, as requested by the UN resolution?","Mr. Speaker, absolutely. Our work in Libya is in accordance with the UN resolution. Our military mission has not changed. The resolution on this policy, which we will debate tomorrow, will aim to extend the mission by three and a half months."
128,"Mr. Speaker, the suffering of the Libyan people has gone on for far too long. What is needed now is a Libyan-led political transition. The international community must work to negotiate a ceasefire and to ensure the continued protection of civilians. \lineBreak  Considering that, can the ","Mr. Speaker, the UN sanctioned mission in Libya to protect the vulnerable civilians is not a partisan one. \lineBreak I want to say I greatly appreciate the engagement of both the New Democrats and the Liberals on this very important issue.

129,"Mr. Speaker, people would think that no one would be a fan of Gadhafi, but he has been pretty good for business. \lineBreak Under the government, Canada's exports to Libya have skyrocketed and that included the sale of arms to the Gadhafi regime. Canadian owned SNC-Lavalin received a $275 million contract to build a prison for Gadhafi. \lineBreak Will the government finally take steps to ensure that Canadian investment never contributes to human rights violations abroad?","Mr. Speaker, obviously this government and this House have authorized sanctions be made against the Libyan regime, a specified group of people. \lineBreak I am certainly very happy to entertain any ideas or suggestions that the  \lineBreak Obviously one of the key elements of Canada's foreign policy is to promote Canadian values, the values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law abroad.

The  \lineBreak The ","Mr. Speaker, we had to move expeditiously, as we did at the height of the economic downturn, to get infrastructure projects moving. These infrastructure projects had to move especially quickly. \lineBreak At the end of the day, as Minister of Infrastructure, I signed off on the estimates. One of the things contained in there was a proposal recommended to me by the public service, a proposal that I accepted, to use that gateway fund to get the projects moving especially quickly to meet the tight timeframes. \lineBreak The Auditor General has made some important recommendations on transparency and accountability to Parliament and this government completely agrees."
131,"Mr. Speaker, maybe the government is not precisely sure what the money was spent on, but let us just remind folks here in the House that even under the disguise of the G8 legacy fund some of this just does not cut it. \lineBreak There is $1.2 million for benches, bike racks and flagpoles 62 kilometres from the summit; $1.3 million on sidewalks 85 kilometres from the summit; and $2 million on a walkway, docking facilities, landscaping and lighting 131 kilometres away from the summit, nowhere near the border. How can the government justify these kinds of expenditures?","Mr. Speaker, there were three objectives of the legacy fund. The second was to spruce up an already beautiful part of our country. There were literally 2,000 journalists from around the world in addition to thousands and thousands of delegates, some staying well in excess of 100 kilometres away from the summit site itself. These were all public infrastructure projects that came in on budget. Every single dollar was accounted for on these municipal public infrastructure projects."

We are now coming up to June 23, which is always a moment of enormous sadness and memory for the families of the Air India bombing.  \lineBreak Why is it that the Government of Canada has made no decision yet with respect to ","Mr. Speaker, the bombing of Air India Flight 182 is a stark reminder that Canada is not immune from the threat of terrorism.  \lineBreak One of the first acts of our government was to commission an inquiry into the Air India bombing, something that had been left long neglected by the prior Liberal government. By commissioning the Major report to investigate the failings that led to the attack in 1985, our government listened to the families of victims when no other government would."
133,"Mr. Speaker, if one listens to what Judge Major has said recently about the conduct of the government since his report was published, it is very clear that the kind of pious sanctimony coming out of the mouth of the  \lineBreak I ask the minister, why no ","Mr. Speaker, I do not know why you have not moved on it, but what I can say is that we have delivered our response to that report with the Air India inquiry action plan. This action plan is a road map, a document that looks at where we were, where we are and where we need to go to help ensure that such a horrific attack does not occur again. \lineBreak We thank the families of the victims who have worked and consulted on this action plan and we commit to their continued involvement and consultation through this ongoing process."
134,"Mr. Speaker, a legacy of deceit, pork and cynicism. It sounds like the old Liberal sponsorship scandal, but it is the editorial pages commenting on the behaviour of the new  \lineBreak The member has abused the public trust and he must come clean. Will he explain to the House how he managed to divert $50 million from border infrastructure payments and put it into a private slush fund? Can he explain why the Auditor General was unable to find any evidence of oversight or documentation to explain this outrageous spending spree?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to begin with that question. Just about everything the member opposite said is not the case. \lineBreak With respect to the G8 legacy fund, we supported 32 public infrastructure projects. Every single dollar is accounted for. To move expeditiously, the public service recommended using this fund so that we could use existing authorities to move quickly. I accepted that recommendation.  \lineBreak The Auditor General has suggested that we need greater transparency and greater accountability. There is no argument from me or from this government. We fully accept the great work that the Auditor General has done on this issue."
135,"Mr. Speaker, it is not good enough that the member is hiding behind the verbosity as a member for  \lineBreak The government promised to do politics differently. Instead, we have the spectacle of three amigos divvying up pork barrel slush funds and he cannot stand in the House and produce any evidence or documentation that could have stopped this outrageous Muskoka gravy train.","Mr. Speaker, I encourage the member opposite to read the report of the Auditor General. He speaks about a committee of three people making decisions with respect to public infrastructure. In fact, that is not the case. None of the decisions with respect to the 32 projects was approved by that committee or any of the three individuals who served on it."
136,"Mr. Speaker, in 2006, when the Conservatives promised to do things differently from the Liberals, the Conservative platform said that they would “oblige public officials to create the records necessary to document their actions and decisions”. That is precisely what the former industry minister seemed to be desperately lacking with regard to the G8 spending scandal. \lineBreak What changed between the time when he called for sound management of public money and 2010, when a slush fund was created to please the minister's friends in his riding? ","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the member opposite that in fact is not the case. There was a full and complete contribution agreement for each of the 32 public infrastructure projects that were accounted for. Each of the projects came in on budget and in each of the projects every dollar was accounted for.  \lineBreak The Auditor General has raised some concerns about the process in terms of the selection of public infrastructure projects. We certainly agree with her recommendations and will work to implement them in very short order."
137,"Mr. Speaker, like magic, the concept of ministerial responsibility seems to have completely disappeared from the vocabulary of all Conservative ministers, especially when the time comes to explain misspending and poor management in a given department. On the other hand, they do not hesitate to take credit for the economic recovery, even though this government shamefully dragged its feet until it risked losing power. \lineBreak Canadians want to know why they should have to pay the price of cuts to services when the government cannot seem to explain its wasteful G8 spending.","Mr. Speaker, the government supported more than 28,000 public infrastructure projects in every part of the country. The Auditor General, in her last report in 2010, looked at that and gave the government an A. \lineBreak  With respect to the 32 projects in this one fund, she has recommended two areas where she thinks it could have been done better and the government has fully accepted that advice. \lineBreak All of these infrastructure projects, like resurfacing the runway of an airport, building a community centre, resurfacing a provincial highway, are all good public infrastructure projects that will benefit the people of Canada for many years to come."
138,"Mr. Speaker, the latest employment numbers show that, despite what the government is saying, the employment crisis is not over. There are still 1.4 million Canadians without work, plus hundreds of thousands working part-time because they cannot find anything better. Three out of five unemployed people will not receive any help. \lineBreak Why is the minister refusing to support Canadian families that need help returning to the workforce?","Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we tried to do with our economic action plan. We believe that the best way to improve things for these people is to help them find work. To do that, they need to develop skills. That is why we have invested in training for 1,200 people through the economic action plan—to help them find work today and in the future. We have been successful and Friday's numbers prove that."
139,"Mr. Speaker, that is simply not good enough. \lineBreak Last week the minister joked about the  \lineBreak  Instead of just leading Canadians down a yellow brick road, will the government step out from behind the curtain and tie corporate tax incentives to real job creation?","Mr. Speaker, when talking about real job creation, May saw 22,000 more Canadians working. I am not too sure why the opposition thinks that may be a negative. We have 560,000 more Canadians working today than we did in July of 2009. \lineBreak However, that is no reason to stop. That is no reason to hold back this budget. We need to pass the budget quickly so we can continue to create jobs for Canadians."
140,"Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder our manufacturing sector has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. The government just does not get it. \lineBreak Last week we saw more dismal trade numbers. In six years the government has managed to turn a $62 billion trade surplus into a $9 billion deficit. Every serious Canadian observer can see that this country has a trade crisis.  \lineBreak My question for the ","Mr. Speaker, first, I congratulate the member on his election and welcome him to the House. \lineBreak Also, I am pleased to see that he is engaging on the trade file. As he knows, trade is absolutely critical to building our economy. It is critical to creating jobs. It is critical to our long-term prosperity as a country. I would encourage him to get on side with this government as we seek to build that long-term security for our country."
141,"Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing is a return to the days when Canada was a mere hewer of wood and drawer of water, reliant on exports of raw resources for growth. Subsidies to big oil and tax cuts for the most profitable corporations have only helped drive up our dollar far beyond its real value. No wonder our exports are in real trouble. \lineBreak When will the government replace its failed trade policies with targeted measures to boost exports and fix Canada's trade deficit?","Mr. Speaker, the best way to boost exports is to expand our trading relationships around the world. \lineBreak Trade accounts for some 60% of our GDP. I am surprised the member does not know that. He should get onside with our government's plan to expand trading relationships, build our prosperity, create jobs and ensure that economic growth continues."
142,"Mr. Speaker, the forestry industry is the cornerstone of over 300 Canadian communities, a number of which are found in my riding of Pontiac. This industry is in crisis and, since 2005, close to 90,000 jobs have been lost in this industry across Canada. The government claims to be helping this industry, but it is not doing enough. \lineBreak Why does this government insist on giving everything to the oil industry when our country's forestry industry is dying?","Mr. Speaker, in the preceding questions, it was interesting to hear about international trade and open markets since the forestry industry's problem is clearly a matter of markets. Unfortunately, the United States construction industry has encountered major problems, which means that our Quebec and Canadian companies are not able to export as much lumber to the United States. As long as this market is not replaced by new markets, something we have been working on, it will be difficult for our companies to prosper."
143,"Mr. Speaker, last year when the then minister of industry blocked the sale of a potash corporation to BHP Billiton, he said that there was clearly a need to upgrade to update the Investment Canada Act, particularly with respect to an extremely important evaluation criteria called net benefit. \lineBreak We have not heard a word for the past eight months. Foreign investors, Canadians, and I would dare say Parliament, would like to know where that clarity lies. \lineBreak Will the government give us that clarity for which we have been waiting for eight months?","Mr. Speaker, foreign investment is key to the growth of the Canadian economy and our government will continue to encourage it. That being said, significant investments will continue to be reviewable under the Investment Canada Act. \lineBreak I know the House committee was studying the Investment Canada Act before the opposition called an unnecessary election. I hope that study will continue so we can look at ways to improve the act so it works in the best interests of Canadians and our economy."
144,"Mr. Speaker, there is some urgency. We know that TMX, which includes the Toronto stock exchange and other Canadian stock exchanges, could be sold this year, either to a foreign company, the London stock exchange, or to a Canadian company, the Maple Group. \lineBreak There is an urgent need for clarity in this extremely important matter. We have been waiting for eight months. We do not have time to wait for another committee to meet this fall. \lineBreak We need to know what the new net benefit rules are right now.","Mr. Speaker, foreign investment is key to the growth of the Canadian economy, and our government will continue to promote it. \lineBreak That being said, significant investments will continue to be reviewable under the Investment Canada Act.  \lineBreak I know that the House committee was studying the Investment Canada Act before the opposition provoked an unnecessary election. I hope that this study will continue in committee so that we can look at ways to improve the act so that it continues to work in the best interests of Canada and our economy. "
145,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Union of Postal Employees has offered to accept the minister's request to suspend the strike as long as its contract is reinstated. Canada Post is refusing. \lineBreak  The strike drags on and mail delivery is reduced to three days a week. Will the minister push Canada Post to agree to reinstate the contract so we can end this strike and get everyone back to the bargaining table?","Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the  \lineBreak Our government has been given a strong mandate on the economy. I am concerned about the effects this will have on Canadians and Canadian businesses across the country. \lineBreak I urge both parties to reach a negotiated agreement as soon as possible."
146,"Mr. Speaker, if we start by accepting the contract, there will be no strike. \lineBreak While Canada Post management wants to save on operating costs on the backs of the workers, we find that the cuts to service to Canadians are unacceptable. \lineBreak As a result of this strategy, Canadians across the country will get only three days of service a week. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I urge both parties, as I mentioned before, to reach a negotiated agreement as soon as possible. The best solution is one that the parties come up with together, by themselves.  \lineBreak The minister is monitoring the situation closely and will continue to provide the parties with the support and assistance required through the mediator from Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services."
147,"Mr. Speaker, two years after the government passed an attack on pay equity for women in the public service, with the help of the Liberals, it has emerged that the law is too complicated and the rules too severe to be implemented. \lineBreak When will the government stop playing games with women's income and commit to treating pay equity as a right, not as a bargaining chip?",Mr. Speaker—
148,"Order, please. The hon. President of the Treasury Board.","It is always nice to have friends on the other side of the House, Mr. Speaker.  \lineBreak In all seriousness, the hon. member should understand that in order to pass these kinds of regulations, we wish to have discussions. We want to ensure that it is a fair and objective situation, particularly with respect to recourse in terms of the system we are replacing from the original one. That means ensuring we have regulations that make sense for all the parties involved. We anticipate that we will be able to put forward those regulations by the end of this year."
149,"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the minister on his first speech in the House. \lineBreak That being said, this government's position on the issue of pay equity completely abandons women in our country.  \lineBreak In 2011, Canadian women are still earning 71¢ for every dollar earned by a man. Even worse is that we know what to do to remedy the situation. \lineBreak When will this government implement the recommendations of the 2004 pay equity task force? ","Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, there needs to be co-operation in order to pass these kinds of regulations. I can say that by the end of 2011, it will be possible to have regulations. Under this new legislation, the employer and the bargaining agent are jointly responsible for ensuring equitable compensation when they are setting wages and not through a separate pay equity process or judicial enforcement."
150,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Will the minister leave the rescue centres where they should be in order to save lives?","Mr. Speaker, the consolidation of the search and rescue dispatch centres into the joint rescue coordination centres will have no negative impact on the current levels of service provided by the Coast Guard. The maritime community across Canada will still receive services in both official languages by both the Coast Guard, the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary and Canadian Forces aircraft from their existing locations. Mariners in distress will continue to communicate with the Maritime and traffic communication centres and the same ships and aircraft will respond as they have always done."
151,"Mr. Speaker, later today, Parliament will vote on approving budget 2011, the next phase of Canada's economic action plan. This is a positive, forward-looking plan to keep Canada's economy growing while helping Canadian families, seniors and communities.  \lineBreak Indeed, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said that the plan would support the economic recovery by helping Canadian businesses prosper, compete and create jobs. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, once again we heard good numbers from Stats Canada: 22,000 more jobs in May. That brings us to a total of 560,000 jobs, as I have said, since July 2009. \lineBreak However, if there is one Canadian still looking for a job, that is too many. We need to move forward with this budget because there are provisions in it that will help Canadians get back to work. It is important. It is urgent."
152,"Mr. Speaker, last fall, the Canada Revenue Agency gave itself top marks for its handling of requests for tax rulings. However, an audit revealed that CRA had cooked the books, left out some requests and did not start the clock when it got the others. It is easy to score top marks when an agency makes up the rules as it goes along. \lineBreak What is the ","Mr. Speaker, internal auditing is in place in order to keep the agency accountable and to ensure service to Canadians is constantly improving. \lineBreak As a result of this internal audit, CRA has in place an action plan designed to continue to improve the ways Canadians can interact with CRA regarding their taxes and their benefits. Our government is committed to the fair and equitable tax treatment of all Canadians."
153,"Mr. Speaker, the government in fact gets an “F” for failure. \lineBreak Look at the issue of tax evasion. Business people allegedly even bribed employees of the Canada Revenue Agency in order to better defraud the tax system. What action was taken? Nine employees were dismissed, but still no action has been taken against the fraudsters. When will the public finally see action taken on the cases of tax fraud? ","Mr. Speaker, this government appreciates that this is a very serious issue and we will not tolerate the types of alleged activities that are being reported. The RCMP, of course, is investigating this case and our officials are working with the RCMP. To be clear, many of these allegations date back more than a decade. "
154,"Mr. Speaker, the E. coli outbreak in Germany gives Canadians even more reasons to worry about the safety of Canada's food. In fact, the  \lineBreak How many of these new employees will act as inspectors and protect Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I know the member has been paying close attention to the debate in the House on our budget. A colleague of mine mentioned that we will be voting on the budget this afternoon. \lineBreak I would remind the member that in the budget there is an extra $100 million over five years to enhance food safety. In addition, we are providing CFIA with a net increase of 733 inspection staff. \lineBreak I would ask that member to stand in his place this afternoon and vote in favour of our government's budget."
155,"Mr. Speaker, actually, on page 110 we see $9 million and $8 million, which do not quite add up to $100 million. \lineBreak The government does not get it. This is about the safety of the food that Canadians put on their families plates. \lineBreak The results are in: CFIA is underfunded and we need more inspectors. \lineBreak The Conservatives are failing. They brag about putting new money in the budget but they are actually taking it out. \lineBreak When will the government stop playing shell games and making semantic arguments and get to the truly important work of ensuring food is safe for all Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I mentioned to that member last week that CFIA's first priority is the safety of Canadians. We are strengthening Canada's food safety system by ensuring the largest ever budgets for CFIA, which that member and his party consistently vote against. \lineBreak We are continually reviewing costs to ensure efficiency. \lineBreak I will finish up with a quote from a report on OECD countries that states: \lineBreak  That is our track record."
156,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's G8 report shows that $50 million was quietly scooped from the border infrastructure fund to pay for gazebos hundreds of kilometres from the border. \lineBreak Border infrastructure funds must reduce congestion and enhance security to qualify. In 2003, the fund upgraded Knight Street in Vancouver, though it is not close to the border, because it reduced congestion on a major border route. \lineBreak Could the government explain how a gazebo reduces border congestion or enhances security?","Mr. Speaker, I have spoken of this before but I will reiterate. \lineBreak I signed off on the estimates of the department and ultimately I am accountable. I am right here in Parliament being held accountable for them.  \lineBreak The professional public service recommended that this fund be used as a vehicle to get quick action with respect to projects that were important as Canada was hosting the G8, and that is exactly what we did.  \lineBreak The Auditor General has come forward and said that she would like greater transparency and greater accountability. We completely agree and have accepted all of her recommendations."
157,"Mr. Speaker, despite the Canada Revenue Agency giving itself top grades on service to taxpayers, an internal audit found that these grades were in fact inflated by almost 20% and fell well below acceptable standards. \lineBreak The Conservatives continue to pat themselves on the back, to mislead the public and hide their own incompetence. Could the minister please explain this lack of accountability to Canadian taxpayers who have the right to expect timely, respectful service?","Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to the fair and equitable tax treatment of all Canadians. An important example of this is our government's creation of the taxpayers bill of rights, along with the Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsman. \lineBreak Internal auditing does take place in order to keep the agency accountable and to ensure that services to Canadians continue to improve."
158,"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to doling out cash or smearing its opponents, the government does it better than anyone else. However, when it comes to consultations on important issues, it mysteriously loses its marketing edge.  \lineBreak For the government's secretive border deal with the U.S., a so-called publication process is a four point questionnaire put on a government website. \lineBreak Why is the government hiding the process and not ensuring that Canadians are consulted on one of the most important issues for our country?","Mr. Speaker, in the preamble to that question, the member opposite talked about spending taxpayer dollars on infrastructure projects. In fact, his riding is receiving some of the highest amounts for public infrastructure in all of Canada. That is because it deals with the perimeter and trade. \lineBreak We want to ensure that we have an appropriate arrangement with the United States that will allow the auto worker in southwestern Ontario to continue to have employment so that more jobs and more opportunities are obtained through working constructively with President Obama's administration. \lineBreak I would think that member would want to join us and support such an important initiative."
159,"Mr. Speaker, the reason my border community is finally getting the justice it deserves is because New Democrats understand the border issue. The government does not understand the border issue. Every time it has been involved in border issues, it ends up thickening the border, costing jobs and putting us in a trade deficit. That is the reality of the government's record. \lineBreak Why is the government afraid to consult Canadians with regard to how we will change our border practices? Why will it not actually listen to them? Why will we not have a proper dialogue. What is the government afraid of? It does not want to hear the truth from Canadians. They are concerned.","Mr. Speaker, we certainly welcome the input of members opposite. If the member opposite or his constituents have any ideas on how we can de-thicken the border, we are certainly prepared to do that. \lineBreak I think there is no other government in Canadian history that has paid more attention and given greater focus to the Windsor-Detroit crossing than this government. We have come forward with a substantial plan. We are waiting for news from the people in Lansing, Michigan and the state capital as to whether they will endorse that vision and get on board with the federal government to ensure that jobs can be created on both sides of the border."
160,"Mr. Speaker, this weekend, the leader of the official opposition will be travelling to Vancouver for his party's convention where the NDP will be debating a proposal, the NDP policy resolution to nationalize the auto industry, that calls upon the party to effectively campaign for the naturalization of the big three auto companies. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is focused on passing the next phase of Canada's economic action plan. We believe that calling on the government to nationalize an industry, especially one that is critical to our nation's economy, is reckless and irresponsible. \lineBreak I would call upon my hon. colleagues to stand today and denounce such a position."
161,"Mr. Speaker, I asked the  \lineBreak The minister said, “I have instructed my officials to follow up on this veteran's case”. \lineBreak  Mr. Melanson has not heard from any officials at Veterans Affairs with regard to the specifics of his case and he has now gone 10 days without food.  \lineBreak Did the minister keep his word and instruct his officials to follow up with Mr. Melanson, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, our government has apologized for what happened years ago. My two predecessors have presented apologies and I also feel sorry for what happened under the previous government. \lineBreak However, corrective measures were taken. I have instructed my officials and they are closely monitoring the situation so we take care of the health of this veteran and of all veterans."
162,"Mr. Speaker, for six years, Nathalie Morin, a 27-year-old Canadian, has been held against her will by her husband in Saudi Arabia. She and her three children are prisoners in their own home, and according to Ms. Morin's mother, their rights and freedoms are violated every day. \lineBreak In accordance with the motion unanimously adopted by the Quebec National Assembly on Friday, does the federal government commit to taking the measures required to repatriate Ms. Morin and her children?","Mr. Speaker, we are aware of this case and have been in close touch with Ms. Morin on this issue. This is a complex family matter and there is no easy solution. Consular officials will continue to work with Ms. Morin and Saudi officials toward a positive resolution to the matter. \lineBreak I can also advise the House that this case has been raised by ministers in their meetings with Saudi officials."
163,"Mr. Speaker, as the servant of  \lineBreak National Public Service Week is a perfect opportunity to reflect upon the many contributions that public servants make to our society every day. \lineBreak With that in mind, I would like to ask the ","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for  \lineBreak Indeed, National Public Service Week is an opportunity to acknowledge the effort and contribution of our public servants. Due in part to their hard work across this country, Canada is emerging from the global recession as one of the world's top-performing advanced economies. \lineBreak Moving forward, public service skill and expertise will be helpful in streamlining government operations and programs to ensure value for taxpayer money. We salute them. We salute all those Canadians who serve in our public service."
164,"Mr. Speaker, last week I rose in the House to bring to light the fact that members of the Castillo Olivares family, who fled their country because of death threats, would be kicked out of Canada on June 15. Nothing has happened since I made that speech. If nothing is done, they will be deported to Mexico in two days. \lineBreak Can the minister stay the removal order for one month in order to allow the children to finish the school year and the family to complete preparations for their deportation?","Mr. Speaker, under the Privacy Act, a minister is not authorized to publicly comment on a specific case without permission from those involved. So I encourage any member who has concerns about a specific case to raise them with me in private so that I can provide them with answers."
165,"Mr. Speaker, we cannot say that the government leads by example. The President of the Treasury Board is demanding cuts, but cabinet offices have been going in the other direction. Since 2008, there has been a 14% increase in the budgets of ministers' offices. \lineBreak What does one say to aboriginal chiefs who come to Ottawa to report that there are still houses that are not hooked up to water systems on their reserves? What does one say to low-income seniors who must settle for a $1.60 a day increase in the guaranteed income supplement?","Mr. Speaker, we ran on the principle that it is time to balance the budget. We put forward a clear plan to the people of Canada to balance the budget one year earlier than in our previous budgetary plan in 2014-15. We have a clear goal and we have a clear means to get there.  \lineBreak That is what the people of Canada have spoken to, that is why they elected this government and that is why we are moving with those plans."
166,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians want assurance that the involvement in Libya will be in strict accordance with United Nations resolution 1973. That means it has to focus on civilian protection, humanitarian assistance and diplomatic support for the UN efforts to reach a ceasefire so that there can be, ultimately, a Libyan-led political resolution to the crisis. That is precisely what the New Democrat amendments to the motion propose today. \lineBreak Will the government support our proposals?","Mr. Speaker, the government has undertaken its involvement in Libya under United Nations resolution 1973, in concert with our allies. We have made it very clear all along that we are seeking the furtherance of that resolution and its objectives, and those will continue to be our actions."
167,"I will assume that is a yes, Mr. Speaker, but I guess we will wait to see the results of the vote. \lineBreak Yesterday, the  \lineBreak Now the question is what is the timetable for that help and how can we be sure that the government is taking the actions necessary to achieve the ceasefire so that the help can actually get to the people? \lineBreak  Could we have an explanation of how that is going to be done?","Mr. Speaker, the government remains committed to being a humanitarian partner in Libya and to doing at least our share of the international effort there in that regard. \lineBreak Obviously, delivering humanitarian aid is extremely difficult in some parts of the country under the circumstances, but we continue to work with our international partners, international agencies and others to facilitate passage of that aid."
168,"Mr. Speaker, the most frequent problem with this government, this administration, is a lack of co-operation and transparency when it comes to the cost of operations, such as the operation in Libya. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, we are committed to being as transparent as possible. Clearly, we will work with the House committees or through other mechanisms to ensure that any information that can be made available is made available."
169,"Mr. Speaker, peaceful democratic protesters in the Middle East and North Africa have inspired all Canadians. Sadly, in Libya, Gadhafi sent in his army to savagely crush protests.  \lineBreak New Democrats supported the UN's call to protect the people of Libya. However, we know that in the end it will be a diplomatic solution that will end the crisis in Libya. \lineBreak To that end, I want to ask the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada is tremendously proud of our commitment to freedom, to democracy, to human rights, to the rule of law. Our government is proud of the work that our men and women in uniform are doing in Libya. We want to work to increase our diplomatic efforts to end the violence and to protect civilians and our humanitarian efforts. It is certainly my intention to be at the next Libya contact group meeting."
170,"Mr. Speaker, the motion on Libya deplores the ongoing human rights violations being committed by the Gadhafi regime. Reports show that sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war. Deploring the situation is not enough. We must take action to protect the rights of Libyans. \lineBreak Will Canada make a tangible commitment to the international community to support the investigation of these crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice?","Mr. Speaker, today, in fact, the "
171,"Mr. Speaker, we now know some of the cuts the  \lineBreak Why does the government think that prisons are more important than heritage?","Mr. Speaker, that is completely untrue. Canada is the only G8 country that decided not to cut, not to maintain, but to increase its funding for culture. \lineBreak I would like to say as well that what we have done over the past years within the Department of Canadian Heritage is reduce the size of the department by 13%, while maintaining our commitment to arts and cultural and Canadian heritage across the country. \lineBreak We have made the bureaucracy smaller, we have made the department smaller while maintaining our commitment to Canadians and standing up for Canadian culture."
172,"Mr. Speaker, this is the government's job creation priority, hiring more prison guards? \lineBreak Let us be serious. In Canada, culture is a multibillion dollar industry. It creates real jobs. It gives hope. It shows Canada at its best. Cutting Heritage Canada by a third is bad cultural policy and bad economics. \lineBreak How can the minister justify encouraging us to take something away from society rather than make it richer?","We should read between the lines of his question, Mr. Speaker. What he is saying is make the department bigger, thereby taking funding away from culture. That is not the way to do it. \lineBreak We believe in supporting culture, not making the bureaucracy bigger. Members opposite have it exactly backward. \lineBreak By doing what we have done, which is making bureaucracy smaller and making more money available, it makes room available for what we proposed in budget 2011, which is the $500 per child arts tax credit so that children can get involved in the arts, performing arts, language, so they can participate in Canada's cultural mosaic. That is good culture policy, not NDP policy."
173,"Mr. Speaker, everyone agrees that it is scandalous that $50 million was taken from the border infrastructure fund to fund projects in the riding of the minister hosting the G8 summit. The fact that this same minister is now in charge of the Treasury Board is also scandalous and source of worry for the country's taxpayers. Even more disconcerting is that the minister does not even try to explain his actions. \lineBreak Can someone at least try to justify these poor choices and finally give us some real answers?","Mr. Speaker, 32 public infrastructure projects were supported. Each of the 32 projects was completed on time. Each of the 32 projects was fully accounted for and every single dollar was spent on public infrastructure. \lineBreak I do notice that it is not only the  \lineBreak Even the Liberals are supporting these great public infrastructure projects."
174,"Mr. Speaker, while the minister was taking advantage of the money in the border infrastructure fund, the Canada Border Services Agency had to close three posts and reduce hours in order to save money. \lineBreak Can the President of the Treasury Board—yes, the President of the Treasury Board—tell the Canadians who will be affected by these cuts and who will have to wait in line at customs this summer how the investments in his riding, 300 kilometres from the border, will help reduce congestion? How will that shorten line-ups at the border?","Mr. Speaker, what the government did is use the authority of an existing program to fast-track these public infrastructure projects at the height of the global economic downturn. \lineBreak These investments were all part of Canada's economic action plan, a plan that has helped to create 560,000 net new jobs. \lineBreak The member opposite may not be aware, but because of that economic action plan Canada is leading the advanced economies, and because of that economic action plan this "
175,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak It is so bad that he has friend, the  \lineBreak The Auditor General's report is clear, and I will quote: Senior officials said “their input had not been sought”. \lineBreak This deal was cooked up by the member from Muskoka. Public servants were deliberately frozen out. \lineBreak When will the minister take responsibility for his abuse of public trust?","Mr. Speaker, just because the member opposite says something does not mean it is true. \lineBreak Here is what we did. We supported investments to help Canada host the G8 with infrastructure, resurfacing the runway of an airport, resurfacing a provincial highway, and building the G8 centre which is now a community centre. \lineBreak  Each of those projects was approved by the minister of infrastructure of the day. Each of those projects came in fully on budget. For each of those projects, there is a full contribution agreement that was negotiated with the municipality. These are all good projects. \lineBreak The Auditor General gave some advice on better transparency and better clarity and we fully accepted that counsel."
176,"Mr. Speaker, there are a number of disturbing elements to this scandal. \lineBreak First, of course, is the minister's flagrant abuse of the public trust. Second, now that he has been caught, is the way he hides behind the  \lineBreak Given the sheer scale of this dubious spending and the fact that he is in Treasury Board, how can we trust this minister? It is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. \lineBreak Where is the accountability? Where is the transparency?","Mr. Speaker, I would say to the member for  \lineBreak Here is the reality. We supported 32 public infrastructure projects. Each of them had a negotiated contribution agreement with the local municipality. \lineBreak The Auditor General has come forward and given us counsel and advice on what we might do better on the intake process for public infrastructure projects and on reporting to Parliament where there could be greater clarity and greater transparency. \lineBreak We thank the Auditor General for her work and fully accept her recommendations."
177,"Mr. Speaker, I am listening but I am not hearing accountability. I am hearing bafflegab. \lineBreak Since the member from Muskoka cannot stand up and defend his actions, I will turn to his friend and I will ask him why he allowed the minister to cook up this deal to bypass all the checks and balances? Why did he allow $50 million in border infrastructure to be divvied up by the three amigos, the mayor, the minister and the hotel manager? \lineBreak Since the member from Muskoka will not apologize to this House, will his friend take responsibility and apologize to the Canadian people for his partner's misuse of public funds?","Mr. Speaker, as to the three individuals the member mentioned, none of these three individuals approved a single project. \lineBreak All of the projects were approved by the minister of infrastructure, by me. All 32 projects are public infrastructure projects, things like paving provincial highways, constructing a new runway and a community centre. We used the existing authorities under the border infrastructure fund. \lineBreak The Auditor General has made advice and counsel that we could be more open and more transparent in terms of Parliament. We fully accept the Auditor General's advice and thank her for her good work."
178,"Mr. Speaker, a great sense of anxiety continues to grow across this country as the labour dispute continues with Canada Post. \lineBreak Business operators, rural residents and seniors are all beginning to feel the pain of this current dispute. We have seen actions taken on both sides that further enhanced that. This can certainly contribute to long-term hurt and long-term pain for the corporation. \lineBreak  I would ask the minister if she has placed a deadline on mediation? If not, will she?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is exactly correct in what he says. We are beginning to see these rolling strikes, and the means by which Canada Post is dealing with these rolling strikes, affect the average Canadian, seniors and business in general. \lineBreak That is why it is important for us to continue to monitor the situation. We want the parties to reach an agreement as soon as possible. I have written to them. I have met with them separately. The parties should be strongly encouraged to reach a deal on their own accord."
179,"Mr. Speaker, those are fine words, but the reality is that the Canada Post strike is now 11 days old. Today, 15,000 people in Toronto and Montreal are on strike. In addition, Air Canada began striking at midnight. Travel season is upon us. This will have a major impact on the economy, but a negotiated settlement is the preferred solution. \lineBreak Will the minister take responsibility and require the parties to sit down and negotiate in good faith to come to an agreement? Canadians and Quebeckers need it.","Mr. Speaker, as I briefly indicated, I have met with the parties separately. I have met with the parties together on a number of occasions. I have written the parties directly, asking them to show good faith to the Canadian public to make sure that they are doing the best they can to reach a deal, to be focused on getting a deal, and to make sure that they are looking after the Canadian public's interest. \lineBreak The obligation is for these two parties to reach a deal. At some point, we have to make sure that the Canadian public's interest is protected."
180,"Mr. Speaker, today over 55,000 working Canadians are walking off the job in order to fight for their pensions. Why are they doing this? They know that the Conservative government's inaction is leaving employees and employers to sort the pension crisis out for themselves.  \lineBreak Just like the government failed pensioners at Nortel, pension security is now on the block at Canada Post and Air Canada. Inaction, rhetoric and empty promises are not a plan. \lineBreak When will the government get serious about helping Canadians plan for their retirement?","Mr. Speaker, we are all concerned about the labour disputes that seem to be centred over pensions. Let me assure the hon. member and the House that this government is doing the best it can to make sure that we are protecting those Canadians who actually do not have a pension, and that is many Canadians. \lineBreak We are putting in place a plan in conjunction with our provincial partners, a pooled registered pension plan that would cover all of those Canadians and provide an opportunity for all of those Canadians who do not have a pension as of this day."
181,"Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the Auditor General's report that the government has turned a blind eye to first nations, we discover it has an eye on them after all, a covert surveillance operation. \lineBreak A document entitled “Aboriginal Hot Spots and Public Safety” reveals that INAC, RCMP and CSIS have spied on so-called aboriginal hot spots. It is not about guns and drugs. It is about aboriginal disputes over lands, resources, fisheries and budget shortfalls. \lineBreak Will this covert surveillance continue despite the newly announced first nations joint action plan?","Mr. Speaker, we respect the right of all Canadians to engage in peaceful protest and we remain committed to ensuring the rights, health and safety of all citizens are respected. \lineBreak My department does monitor all emergencies, such as floods, fires and civil unrest on an ongoing basis. This facilitates quick support and response as needed to any emergency."
182,"Mr. Speaker, the RCMP rationalizes spy operations due to mounting frustrations with unresolved land claims and conflicts over treaty, hunting and fishing rights, environmental impacts, sovereignty issues, and economic and social concerns. \lineBreak Surely Canadians would agree it is reasonable to be frustrated when their children lack clean drinking water, access to safe schools and decent housing. \lineBreak When will the government get its priorities straight and focus its efforts on ensuring the well-being of aboriginal peoples?","Mr. Speaker, it is illustrative today that we had the native police and the RCMP in a collaborative arrangement called in by the community to take out lawbreakers in the Mohawk communities. This is something that is a real concern and something that we need to do. \lineBreak We are working collaboratively on all kinds of fronts. That is why we came up with a joint action plan working with the National Chief last week. We are collaborating and we are getting things done."
183,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has spent more than a decade trying to stop asbestos from being placed on the Rotterdam Convention list of hazardous materials. We have now learned that Health Canada informed the government of the dangers associated with asbestos and recommended that this product be added to the list. The Conservatives ignored this advice.  \lineBreak Will this government reconsider and allow asbestos to be added to the Rotterdam Convention list?","Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, Canada has promoted the safe and controlled use of chrysotile at home and abroad. In addition, scientific publications show that chrysotile can be used safely under controlled conditions."
184,"Mr. Speaker, that is not true. \lineBreak This is a simple issue. This is about protecting lives. This is about ensuring materials are used safely. \lineBreak The Conservatives allowed the exportation of 750,000 tonnes of asbestos in 2006, particularly to the developing world where workers are least protected. One hundred thousand people a year are killed from asbestos. \lineBreak Will the government finally put lives ahead of politics and allow this deadly product to be listed under the UN's Rotterdam Convention?","Mr. Speaker, once again, for more than 30 years, Canada has promoted the safe and controlled use of chrysotile at home and abroad. The premier of Quebec himself said, “The government has not changed its mind. It will continue to defend the safe use of chrysotile, a policy that should be defended.” \lineBreak Earlier, he said, “Quebec promotes the safe use of chrysotile. That is what we do at home and that is what is encouraged throughout the world.”"
185,"Mr. Speaker, following the passing of the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973, Canada and its NATO partners took action in Libya to defend the lives of its innocent civilians who found themselves under siege by the regime of Colonel Gadhafi.  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, the reasons that Parliament voted unanimously back in March to impose sanctions against the Libyan regime and undertake a UN sanctioned mission exist today. We are there to protect the vulnerable civilian population that is under attack by its own government.  \lineBreak We believe the military mission is incredibly important but so too is adding humanitarian support, additional diplomatic measures and, as has been suggested by others in the House, support for good governance from the transitional council. \lineBreak  We will be working closely with the transitional council and ensuring that our men and women in the armed forces have the tools they need to do the job."
186,"Mr. Speaker, it is senseless, reckless, hasty and dangerous. Those are some of the words used to describe the decision to close the rescue communication centre in my riding of St. John's South—Mount Pearl. Experts, unions, the provincial fisheries minister and Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have all spoken out against this indefensible move by the Conservative government. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, the consolidation of the regional dispatch centre into the existing Joint Rescue Coordination Centre will have no negative impact on the current levels of service provided by the Canadian Coast Guard. Safety and response time will not be affected. \lineBreak  This consolidation is due to technological advances and represents a positive change by locating all maritime and air search and rescue coordinations in the same centre working side by side."
187,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Where are the government's priorities? It finds billions for fighter jets and corporate tax give-aways but then make cuts that jeopardize the safety of Canadians who work off our shores. We have one of the worst search and rescue response times in the world. We should be improving our services, not cutting them.  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I see that the member opposite has his questions down pat as well. \lineBreak The fact is that mariners in distress will continue to be serviced by the same lifeboats, the same inshore rescue boats, the same Coast Guard vehicles and the same aircraft from the same present locations. This will have no impact on safety and is a very positive move."
188,"Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague from  \lineBreak Can the minister explain how those services could possibly remain the same, without any impact on quality, when just last Friday, some people calling the centre in Halifax were not able to receive adequate, prompt service in French?","Mr. Speaker, we have indicated all along that bilingual services will be available. There will be no change in the service provided. The Canadian Coast Guard will ensure that bilingual capacity will be made available at the consolidated joint rescue centres."
189,"Mr. Speaker, this reminds me of Service Canada in the Atlantic provinces. \lineBreak Quebeckers want services in French. Since this government cannot even ensure that Canadians can have their cases heard in French in the country's highest court, it should come as no surprise that it cannot guarantee French-language services after it closes the search and rescue offices in Quebec City. \lineBreak Search and rescue means saving lives. Does this government realize that Canadians did not give it a mandate to endanger people's safety?","Mr. Speaker, I thought I was very clear in my answer to the previous question. \lineBreak The maritime communities across Canada will continue to be served in both official languages by the Coast Guard ships, the Coast Guard auxiliary and the Canadian Forces aircraft. The Canadian Coast Guard will ensure that bilingual capacity exists at all of the joint rescue coordination centres."
190,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are rightly outraged. Yesterday, the federal court ordered the  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, I cannot comment on any individual case. However, it is important to be very clear. Canadians who commit crimes abroad run the risk of facing justice abroad. Our government tabled legislation in the last Parliament to ensure that Canadians are kept safe from international offenders. Shockingly, the NDP voted to gut the bill, even going so far as to attempt to remove every reference to ""protecting victims"". \lineBreak Law-abiding Canadians can be reassured that we will reintroduce this legislation as soon as possible and, unlike the NDP, we will put the rights of victims ahead of criminals."
191,"Mr. Speaker, there is a disturbing pattern of the government abandoning Canadians in difficulty abroad. \lineBreak  Henk Tepper, a New Brunswick potato farmer, has been in a Lebanese prison for almost three months following a commercial dispute. Mr. Tepper's wife and young children say that they have heard nothing but dead air from this government. They have received no information. \lineBreak It is unacceptable for the government to abandon Canadians in circumstances as difficult as Mr. Tepper's. When will the government intervene with Lebanese authorities, have Mr. Tepper released from the prison in Lebanon and brought back to Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his courtesy in letting me know he would be raising this issue. I also thank him for the opportunity to set the record straight. \lineBreak In fact, Mr. Tepper and his family have been given substantial, vigorous and active assistance since the time he was arrested. There have been regular visits and there has been regular contact with Mr. Tepper, his family and his lawyers to give all possible assistance."
192,"Mr. Speaker, in order to allow young people in Lavaltrie to play sports and the secondary school to develop a sports education program, the town needs a sports complex. The Conservatives told us that the regions were their priority. Regional development is also my priority.  \lineBreak Will the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities agree to review the request for funding for this project, which will help the economic and social development of Lavaltrie and the surrounding area?","Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome the hon. member.  \lineBreak The Government of Canada is always very interested in every region of the country and, of course, every region of Quebec. It is a region I know very well, having played a lot of sports there myself. However, as the hon. member knows, the province of Quebec has to give priority to each infrastructure project in the province of Quebec. If the province gives priority to this specific project, then we will see what happens at the federal level. We will be pleased to help this beautiful region."
193,"Mr. Speaker, late last night 3,800 Air Canada customer service and ticket agents went on strike. Canadians are worried about the effect this will have on our economy. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I welcome my hon. colleague from the great fortress of Conservative Toronto. \lineBreak As the member indicated, we are concerned by the effect this strike will have on our economic recovery, which is still fragile, and on Canadians in general. Canadians gave us a strong mandate to complete our economic recovery. That is why we will put on notice tonight legislation to ensure continuing air service for passengers."
194,"Mr. Speaker, here is something the Conservatives never talk about in their budget. Since they took power, a 30% increase in food bank use in the country has been rising and 904,000 Canadians used a food bank last year. What is most despicable is that over 200 veterans, a fourfold increase, in the city of Calgary, where the  \lineBreak How can the government brag about its budget when the heroes of our country have to go begging for food in the richest city in our country?","Mr. Speaker, I want to wish the member well in his position. I appreciate his concern for our veterans. \lineBreak One veteran in the street is one veteran too many. That is why this government, under the leadership of this "

Instead of proposing simply to abolish the Senate, the  \lineBreak Since the Government of Quebec intends to turn to the courts to block these bills if it is not consulted, will the ","Mr. Speaker, we believe the Senate must change in order to reach its full potential as an accountable and democratic institution. As we have always said, we are not interested in opening up the Constitution. Canadians do not want drawn-out constitutional fights. That is why our government will be proceeding with Senate reform that is reasonable and within the authority of Parliament."
196,"Mr. Speaker, the economy and job creation depend on four key factors: consumption, exports, investment and the government. Canadian household debt is far too high. Canadians are at a breaking point. Exports are declining. Corporations are no longer reinvesting because the tax cuts they are getting from the Conservatives are nothing but bonuses for senior management. The ball is in the government's court. \lineBreak When will there be a real strategy for growth and job creation for our workers and our Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, Canada has the best job creation record in the industrialized world. We are currently seeing a private sector-led recovery. Obviously, the budget passed by this Parliament will help us continue this recovery."
197,"Mr. Speaker, the facts run counter to what the  \lineBreak Since the Conservatives came to power, the fact is we have lost hundreds of thousands of good paying manufacturing jobs. The latest data from Statistics Canada today confirms that the bleeding continues. Manufacturing, in particular, and the auto and aerospace industries are losing thousands of jobs. \lineBreak When are we going to realize that the policies are creating low wage part-time jobs and killing the balanced economy that we have been building in our country since the Second World War?","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian economy has created over 550,000 jobs since the recession. Those jobs have been focused in the private sector and on high paying jobs. Those are the facts. Obviously we would like to see more and that is why we passed the budget. \lineBreak The leader of the NDP said earlier that we could not create jobs through consumption, or investment or through exports, that we had to do it through government. On this side, we are aiming to have a private sector-led recovery."
198," Mr. Speaker, the government does not have a plan to create jobs then. That is quite clear. Its only strategy is to prevent working people from the right to bargain. Labour disputes should be dealt with fairly at the bargaining table. \lineBreak First, the government threatens back to work legislation mere hours after Air Canada workers used their legitimate right to strike. Then it turns around, takes a government corporation and locks out its own workers, preventing Canadians from getting their mail. \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, the two parties in both the Air Canada dispute and the Canada Post dispute have thus far been unable to reach a settlement. Due to their inability to reach a settlement, they are threatening greater damage on other parties in the Canadian economy. That is not acceptable to the government.  \lineBreak This government will act to ensure that the Canadian economy and the wider interests of the Canadian public are protected."
199,"Mr. Speaker, Canada Post suddenly locked out all postal workers late last night. Is this bargaining in good faith? \lineBreak The lockout is unnecessary. The union offered to suspend its strikes and work under the old contract during negotiations. \lineBreak What is the minister doing to ensure Canada Post negotiates fairly? Is she fine with Canada Post manufacturing a crisis so the government can step in with back-to-work legislation?","Mr. Speaker, as the  \lineBreak As a result, tonight we will be putting on notice legislation to restore mail delivery service for Canadians."
200,"Mr. Speaker, I have just learned that the  \lineBreak I would like to ask the ","Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the leader of the Liberal Party is talking about, but I can tell him this. Throughout the global recession and recovery, the leaders of the G20 have been working together to address the global economic situation. \lineBreak What we do in each of our own countries in this global economy affects us all, and obviously we are working together to ensure a strong global recovery."
201,"Mr. Speaker, some numbers released today reveal that poverty in this country remains at an unacceptable level. One in ten Canadians lives in poverty. That includes nearly 700,000 children. While this government is building gazebos, middle-class incomes remain stagnant and poverty levels are increasing. \lineBreak When will the minister realize the seriousness of Canada's poverty issue? ","Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, one of the effects of the global recession has been an increase in poverty here in Canada. However, our economic action plan was there to fight poverty. We believe that the best way to fight poverty is to create jobs. That is why we have invested unprecedented amounts of money in training people so they can acquire skills and find work."
202,"Mr. Speaker, 634,000 children are living in poverty, and poverty, as the minister has just said, has been on the rise since the Conservatives took power. Too many have to rely on EI to get by, benefits are running out, and people still cannot find full-time jobs to replace the ones they have lost. \lineBreak How can the government continue to hand out huge tax breaks to profitable banks and oil companies while ignoring Canadian families living in poverty?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP's concern for poverty is a little late in coming.  \lineBreak During the economic action plan, it was our government that tried to help those who were unfortunate enough to lose their jobs through no fault of their own by adding an additional five weeks and by making benefits available to the self-employed. We also provided unprecedented funding for training to help these people get the skills they needed for the jobs of the future.  \lineBreak Unfortunately, the NDP voted against every one of those initiatives to help lift these people out of poverty."
203,"Mr. Speaker, the government has begun announcing staff cutbacks in many departments including HRSDC, Canadian Heritage and Environment Canada. \lineBreak It appears that these cuts have been made arbitrarily and that the government is no longer even trying to justify its actions to Canadians. The government really seems to be making things up as it goes along.  \lineBreak Can the President of the Treasury Board explain the logic behind these cuts—that is, if there is any logic involved?","Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is referring to the report of the Parliamentary Budget Officer which takes a look at part of our plans to ensure that we live within our means as departments, but it does not paint the full picture.  \lineBreak Our plans are on stream. We are looking at rationalizing some services, but also delivering those services to taxpayers in a better way. That is our promise to taxpayers. That was what we ran on during the most recent election campaign and we have a strong mandate to do so."
204,"Mr. Speaker, a year later and Toronto is still waiting for the government to accept full responsibility for the fallout of the G20 mess. Some Toronto councillors are pushing for long-term solutions, but the immediate financial needs still require action. Last week, New Democrats met, for example, with the owner of the Horseshoe Tavern which is one of the businesses still waiting for compensation. \lineBreak When will the government stop stonewalling, treat Toronto with respect, and get their compensation out the door quickly?","Mr. Speaker, this government has always treated the city of Toronto with respect, and let me tell members that on May 2 the people of Toronto showed their support and their respect for this government. Not only did we sweep the GTA with all but one, but we won the most seats in the city of Toronto. \lineBreak  I said to the member opposite when he asked this question last week, and I said to my friend from "
205,"Mr. Speaker, when the Conservatives rewarded their friends in Muskoka, no applications were required, no documentation was needed. However, in Toronto, they piled on paperwork and told Toronto businesses that they have to go into a process that is slow, bureaucratic, unfair and opaque, and then dismissed most of the claims or insulted them with a tiny amount. \lineBreak What did Toronto businesses do to deserve such poor and shabby treatment?","Mr. Speaker, if there are any businesses in the city of Toronto that are waiting for compensation, as I said last week, and I will say again, I got the name of one from the member for  \lineBreak I can say this. Boy, oh, boy, in the last 30 years, the people in Toronto elected the best crop of MPs that we have seen in that city in a long time."
206,"Mr. Speaker, during tourist season in northwestern Ontario, visitors can wait more than three hours to cross the border. \lineBreak For our communities, tourism is a key part of the economy. Yet, the government diverted $50 million from the border infrastructure fund to beautify communities in the minister's riding, using the fund as a private wish list, while ignoring border regions like northwestern Ontario. \lineBreak Is the ","Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to correct the record. No such funds were diverted. We used the existing authorities in this fund to provide support under three specific categories.  \lineBreak The Auditor General has raised some legitimate concerns about the transparency and the clarity to the House of Commons in the approving of those estimates, and we have fully accepted her advice. \lineBreak However, I am very pleased to clarify that not a single dollar was moved that otherwise would have been spent on border infrastructure for this project. So, I know he will be very pleased with that."
207,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak However, yesterday, Winston Pitcher, the head of the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary in Newfoundland and Labrador, told the  \lineBreak Where are the government's priorities? It makes massive increases to its own offices while cutting lifesaving rescue centres. \lineBreak When will the minister admit a mistake has been made and start listening to search and rescue experts?","Mr. Speaker, our government has been clear about finding efficiencies and aligning our resources, but we are absolutely not putting the lives of Canadians at risk. Our top priority will continue to be the safety and security of all Canadians."
208,"Mr. Speaker, once again, regarding the closure of the search and rescue centre in Newfoundland and Labrador, here is a quote: “A call centre? I am offended because it diminishes my role and the essential work that we do for human safety.” Who said that? It was Merv Wiseman, maritime search and rescue coordinator and a former Conservative candidate. \lineBreak Here is another quote: \lineBreak Who said that? The  \lineBreak Will the regional minister for Newfoundland and Labrador, that is right, the member of Parliament for ","Mr. Speaker, that is from a fine source, the former Liberal government that decimated the Canadian Coast Guard through its neglect. \lineBreak Since 2006, our government has made unprecedented investments in the protection of Canadians to the tune of $1.4 billion invested in fleet renewal. In Newfoundland and Labrador, there has been a 33% increase in Canadian Coast Guard positions since we came to office. We have also relocated two of Canada's heaviest and most capable icebreakers, the "
209,"Mr. Speaker, for months the government has been dragging its feet on the issue of foreign investment. In the meantime, the list of foreign companies that are reneging on their commitments through layoffs continues to grow: Vale Inco, Stelco and now Custom House in Victoria. We need new regulations governing foreign investment to determine whether takeovers are truly in the public interest and to determine what guarantees are required. \lineBreak Will the minister develop these new regulations before—yes, before—deciding who the Toronto Stock Exchange will be sold to? ","Mr. Speaker, we have been clear on this side of the House. We want to promote increased competition. Studying foreign investments is essential. We want to give consumers more choice. The hon. member is trying to mix different issues and muddy the waters. One thing is clear: we will continue to move forward with our policies in order to safeguard the economy and ensure that the economic recovery takes solid hold once and for all."
210,"Mr. Speaker, that is not an answer. The truth is that only two out of 13,500 takeovers have been blocked since Investment Canada was created. The takeovers of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan and MacDonald Dettwiler were only stopped after the NDP held the government to account for its lack of transparency. We did the heavy lifting.  \lineBreak Now the minister has moved the deadline of the TMX takeover review into the summer when Parliament is not in session. \lineBreak Will the government commit to acting now to establish a transparent public review of the Toronto Stock Exchange takeover bid?","Mr. Speaker, foreign investment is key to the growth of the Canadian economy and our government will continue to encourage it.  \lineBreak We believe in a strong economy. That being said, significant investments will continue to be reviewable under the Investment Canada Act, and always as a net benefit for Canada."
211,"Mr. Speaker, the latest statistics show an increase of 18% in hate crimes against the gay and lesbian community. While most other hate crimes are committed mainly against property, over half of those committed against gays and lesbians involve violence. This is unacceptable.  \lineBreak What measures does the government intend to take to combat the increase in hate crimes against gays and lesbians? ","Mr. Speaker, our government's track record is clear. We believe strongly in protecting the rights of all Canadians regardless of their background, regardless of their roots. That continues to be the position of our government."
212,"Mr. Speaker, sadly and unjustly, transgender Canadians are still not protected against hate crimes nor are they protected against discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Code.  \lineBreak In its last session, this House passed legislation to provide those protections, legislation that was supported by the  \lineBreak This is a question of equality for Canadians who are our brothers and sisters, our daughters, our sons, our neighbours and our friends. Will this government act now to protect the rights and safety of transgender Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, as I already indicated to this House, the commitment of this government to the equality of all Canadians remains as firm as it has always been. That continues to be our position and will be in the future."

We also call on the Assad regime to stop trying to divert domestic and international attention from its brutal crackdown on peaceful, democratic demonstrations. \lineBreak The situation in Syria is completely unacceptable, and Canada will continue to show its support for people seeking freedom in Syria."
214,"Mr. Speaker, the partial closure of the Mercier Bridge announced yesterday is yet another blow to the people of the south shore. Wait times will be interminable. During the 2008 election, Montreal was promised bridges. In 2011, more promises were made. What has been done? Nothing. Where is the plan? When will the bridge be repaired?","Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member likely knows, ownership of this bridge is shared 50-50 between the Government of Quebec and the federal government. Since our government took office in 2006, we have invested $135 million in repairing the federal government's share of the Mercier Bridge and in continuing the work. As with all bridges in Montreal, we will continue to ensure that the Mercier Bridge is safe, and all options are on the table to keep the area safe."
215,"Mr. Speaker, the summer is going to be very hot, and major traffic jams are expected to affect the entire greater metropolitan area. The minister has made vague promises about a long-term infrastructure plan. The government's inaction over the past six years has led us to the crisis we are experiencing today. \lineBreak When will the federal government understand that Montreal's entire economy is at stake?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has just answered her own question.

216,"Mr. Speaker, young Canadians are facing a tough summer. \lineBreak The unemployment rate for young Canadians stands at 15%, and it has been getting worse. That is double the general rate. This means that university students will be forced to take out more loans and new grads will not find that critical first job. \lineBreak The government's approach to youth employment has clearly failed. Where is the minister's plan to help young Canadians find work?","Mr. Speaker, we do want to help students get prepared, not just for summer jobs but also for their careers in the long term. \lineBreak That is why I was very pleased to announce last week the launch of Canada's summer jobs program for this summer with an additional $10 million in permanent funding. That is an additional 3,500 jobs for students each and every year going forward. \lineBreak These funds will help them get the jobs they need to get experience, and also help pay for their studies going forward so they will not have to go as far into debt."
217,"Mr. Speaker, this government obviously does not understand the extent of the problem of the lack of jobs for the youth of this country. With an unemployment rate of 15% for youth between the ages of 20 and 25, all those who need summer jobs to pay for their education are worried. Not only do our young people go into a great deal of debt to attend school, but, increasingly, they are finding only insecure and poorly paid jobs. \lineBreak What does this government intend to do to reduce youth unemployment?","Mr. Speaker, as I just said, we want to help these young people, these students, acquire experience and skills, not just during the summer but also as part of a long-term career. That is why we have just announced a very large amount of money that will result in the creation of 3,600 additional student jobs this summer in order to help young people obtain experience and earn money to continue their post-secondary education.

Why no plebiscite for prairie farmers?","Mr. Speaker, western Canadian farmers have been inundated with advice from Ontario members and members from downtown Winnipeg, but what they do is listen to their own.  \lineBreak This is what a farmer from Manitoba, the vice-president of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association, said:"

222,"Mr. Speaker, the third example of the government's double standard is the situation we are in with Air Canada and Canada Post. With Air Canada, it is clear that a legal strike started yesterday. Services are still being offered, but the government is in the process of introducing a bill to put an end to the strike. As for Canada Post, the government is very slow to react on behalf of the workers who have been locked out and on behalf of consumers.  \lineBreak Why this double standard?","Mr. Speaker, so far, with both Air Canada and Canada Post, the parties have been unable to reach an agreement. This could cause serious damage to the Canadian economy and to a large part of the population. This government will take action to protect the best interests of the Canadian economy and the Canadian people."
223,"Mr. Speaker, today is Elder Abuse Prevention Day, a time to recognize the abuse many seniors face in our neighbourhoods. Sadly, too many seniors are being physically, sexually and mentally abused by caregivers and loved ones. This should not be a day just to recognize elder abuse, but a day to take action and protect some of our most vulnerable people. \lineBreak Could the minister tell the House and the seniors across this country why the government allowed the elder abuse awareness initiative to end on March 31, with nothing in its place to protect seniors in our country?","Mr. Speaker, any form of abuse is unacceptable. Our government is committed to supporting seniors by combatting elder abuse in all its forms. That is why we have introduced an extensive awareness campaign to take action on this serious issue. We have also committed additional funds in budget 2011 to further support elder abuse awareness. \lineBreak  Our government is taking action to protect vulnerable seniors and we will continue to work hard to do so."

In my region, job losses in this sector have been on the rise for years and we fear the bleeding will continue. \lineBreak What does this government intend to do to help this industry in crisis and when will it take action to protect these jobs in Trois-Rivières?","Mr. Speaker, there was a time when all the books we read were printed on paper. Today, most are in an electronic format. There was a time when the demand for pulp and paper was 50% higher that it is today. We should all get together in 2011 and 2012 to talk about this. To find solutions, we must first identify the problem. Today, it comes down to markets. Unfortunately, we have to look at new products and new markets. Our recent budget provided $60 million to support research and development for new products, to the satisfaction of the Forest Products Association of Canada."

It is now affecting the Canadian economy and it has effect on third party Canadians who are not part of this dispute but are the ones who are suffering from the hardship."
227,"Mr. Speaker, now that we know that the President of the Treasury Board is able to stand, I would like to give him a third opportunity to tell Canadians about his use of the border infrastructure fund for projects in his riding, which is 300 kilometres from the border. \lineBreak How can the President of the Treasury Board tell Canadians that he is going to cut their services when he himself is responsible for wasting $50 million of taxpayers' money?","Mr. Speaker, I have spoken to this issue before.  \lineBreak There were 32 infrastructure projects that went forward, including resurfacing a runway at the airport in North Bay, repaving a provincial highway, and building a community centre. All of those projects came in on time. All of those projects came in under budget.  \lineBreak The Auditor General raised some legitimate concerns and observations about how the government could do a better job and this government has accepted those recommendations."
228,"Mr. Speaker, when Canadians pay their taxes, they expect that their hard-earned dollars are going to be treated with respect. If we look at how the President of the Treasury blew through $50 million on glow sticks and gazebos, it is as if the three amigos, the mayor, the hotel manager and the minister, stuffed the largest porcine pinata ever conceived and then whacked all those baubles and booty over the hills of Muskoka.  \lineBreak When will the minister apologize for this abuse of the public trust?","Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest when the new  \lineBreak With respect to the legacy fund, there were 32 infrastructure projects.

229,"Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP would certainly like to raise the level of debate, but to do that we would have to raise up somebody from the dead. He seems to be either hiding in the doghouse or he was put in the doghouse since he got whacked by the Auditor General.  \lineBreak When Chuck Guité played around with public funds for partisan gain, he got sent to jail. When the minister from Muskoka played around with public funds for partisan gain, he got the keys to the Treasury Board. What kind of message does this send to Canadians?  \lineBreak When will this minister stand up in the House and be accountable for his misrepresentation of public funds?","Mr. Speaker, that, I deeply regret to say, was slanderous and character assassination. I expected better from the New Democratic Party."

They are unable to reach said agreement by themselves, even though they have had ample opportunity to do so, and much support from this government and Labour Canada in terms of reaching an agreement. \lineBreak Therefore, on behalf of Canadians in general and because we have a strong mandate on this economy to make sure it recovers, we have acted."
233,"Mr. Speaker, Canada accepts and protects the rights of workers to collectively bargain. This is a normal process that should not be interfered with. With its special bills, the government is clearly siding with management and is taking away the right of workers to use legal pressure tactics. \lineBreak Why is the government so quick to interfere in a legitimate negotiating process?","Mr. Speaker, as of yet, management and the union have been unable to reach an agreement. They are threatening to do significant damage to the Canadian economy, which this government finds unacceptable. We will act in the best interests of the Canadian economy and the people of Canada."
234,"Mr. Speaker, we have to let the parties come to an agreement. The government should not be getting involved so early on in the process and picking winners. The workers are currently fighting to protect their pensions.

237,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by indicating that the hon. member's characterization of labour law in Canada is completely incorrect. \lineBreak It is also important to note that there are no sides being taken in any kind of legislation that may be put before the House. We are on the side of the economy and of general Canadian interests because we want these parties to make a deal. If they cannot make a deal, we will help them in the process to do so with the least amount of damage to the Canadian public.","Mr. Speaker, labour rights do exist in this country and the government's approach to the current labour disputes wreaks of hypocrisy. The government wants back-to-work legislation, denying workers the right to strike, and undermining their capacity to bargain fairly. \lineBreak In the case of Canada Post, it is a government agency that locked them out. How is that fair negotiation? Why is the government getting in the middle of a labour dispute, and picking winners and losers?"
238,"Mr. Speaker, in this country, we do have the right to collectively bargain, and it is the role of Labour Canada to help facilitate this collective bargaining process. \lineBreak In the case of both Air Canada and Canada Post, we have been diligently at the table providing conciliation and mediation. I have helped to provide services to both parties. We want them to reach their own deal but they have not been able to do.  \lineBreak We need to protect those who do not have a place at that table. That is our appropriate response as the government.","Mr. Speaker, the trouble is that when the only tool we have in our toolbox is a sledgehammer, everything starts to look like a rock.

240,"Mr. Speaker, everyone agrees that, without a doubt, the public interest is important. However, in the public interest, people must also have access to pensions to live on in the future. This is the issue that is at the heart of negotiations, not only those that are currently under way but also future negotiations. This is the gap that the government is creating: it is leaving people to fend for themselves without its support. \lineBreak How can it tolerate this situation?","Mr. Speaker, the government is not taking a position on issues. Discussions are taking place between the parties but the government absolutely cannot tolerate these parties doing significant damage to the economy.

254,"Mr. Speaker, fracturing uses massive amounts of water mixed with very toxic chemicals. Yet the government does not require that companies disclose the nature of the products used. The mixture that is injected into the ground can contaminate the groundwater and waterways. \lineBreak Will the federal government finally require companies to report what they are putting into our soil, as the Americans have done?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, the principle responsibility rests with the provinces and the territories.

Their policy does not make sense and is unfair. \lineBreak When will the minister have the courage to admit that her policy has failed Canadian families? When will she get to work on making child care affordable for all Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we did when we came to office five years ago. We established the universal child care benefit. \lineBreak This was to help Canadians access the form of child care that they thought was best for their children. We believe in choice for Canadians. \lineBreak We also provided funding to the provinces to help them create child care spaces in case the parent's choice was for formal daycare. Since then, in using those funds, the provinces have created over 100,000 spaces to help parents raise their children in their choice."
257,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives just do not get it. There is no choice in child care when one gets $100 a month. It is not enough to help families pay for daycare. \lineBreak The New Democrat plan would create 100,000 new daycare spaces, while still providing families with financial help. The government's plan gives families $3 a day for daycare. \lineBreak Why is the government ignoring parents who cannot afford daycare services for their children?","Mr. Speaker, we recognize that each family in our country is in different circumstances. In some families the parents work evenings, or they work weekends. Some want to stay home and raise their children themselves. Some do want to use formal daycare. Our universal child care benefit gives parents the choice in that. It recognizes and supports the differences. It supports their right to choose how to raise their children."
258,"Mr. Speaker, for a number of years now, we have seen a steady increase in the price of gas at the pumps. Far too often, sudden spikes occur just before long weekends and holidays. People know that, contrary to what the major oil companies would have us believe, these price changes are not based on economics, but on pure speculation. Canadians are being squeezed by these big companies. \lineBreak Can the government ask the Competition Bureau to conduct an investigation into this sector?","Mr. Speaker, the price of gasoline is a major issue that concerns all Canadians, starting with me. That is why we have asked the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to address the issue of fluctuating prices, so that the industry can better explain to Canadians how and why prices change the way they do."
259,"Mr. Speaker, the industry committee has already studied this. We need action and that is what Canadians deserve right now, not another expensive study.  \lineBreak What we see right now are record profits, record gouging, record windfalls for stock speculators, record profits for oil and gas CEOs and we also see record complacency from the government. Canadians have no choice. They have to drive to work and take care of their families. \lineBreak  The minister does have a choice. Therefore, why is he hiding behind the oil companies instead of going after the gouging? Is he addicted to the tax revenue that is coming in? Why will he not establish an industry ombudsman or at least follow through with the recommendations the committee made last time?","Mr. Speaker, the opposition cannot have it both ways. The NDP says that it cares about keeping gas prices low, but it opposed our GST cut and wanted to impose a carbon tax on Canadians that would see gas prices skyrocket. This is not responsible. We have a strong mandate from Canadians for economic growth, and this is what we will do."

We will continue to engage with senior Lebanese officials to request due process in a timely and transparent handling of his file."
262,"Mr. Speaker, the development of our strategy with countries in the Americas is not limited to supporting companies that do business there. We need agencies that liaise between governments, civil society and experts in order to help us develop a more comprehensive strategy for this continent. \lineBreak Can the government commit to providing core funding to Canadian agencies such as FOCAL in order to develop a long-term strategy for the Americas?","Mr. Speaker, as I have advised the House, FOCAL has been given interim financing for a number of years.

However, we have the advantage and help of a great deal of research across the country from other bodies and other institutions."
263,"Mr. Speaker, this government proclaims loud and clear that it wants to focus on our relations with Latin America, but in the meantime, it is not providing adequate funding to an agency like FOCAL to ensure its viability, even though that agency helps us better understand the issues in the Americas. Effective the end of September, FOCAL will be no more. \lineBreak How can Canada have an effective strategy for the Americas if it does not support such an important source of expertise?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, even after the shift away from core funding, the government continued to provide significant funding to FOCAL for a number of years. Some of it was aimed at assisting the organization to become financially sustainable. That was not possible. \lineBreak The Government of Canada does believe that arm's-length Canadian research on the Americas is useful in shaping policy. We continue to explore how such research and analysis might be carried out in the future."
264,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians do not think human smugglers should be permitted to exploit vulnerable refugees. Every year thousands of people wait in line for a chance to come to Canada legally, but these criminals extort thousands of dollars in order to help people jump the queue. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, last year Canada welcomed the largest number of immigrants in six decades. We welcomed more refugees, resettled through the UN, than any other country in the world per capita. We have the fairest asylum system. \lineBreak What we will not accept are criminal gangs seeking to abuse this country's generosity and treating Canada like a doormat by facilitating the illegal and dangerous entry of people paying tens of thousands of dollars to smuggling syndicates. That is why later today the government will table our legislation to crack down on human smuggling, to stop those who would seek to abuse this country's immigration laws and undermine public confidence, and to support legitimate immigration and refugees."
265,"Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday the  \lineBreak The minister's own office has confirmed that his comments were not true. \lineBreak Will the minister, knowing what he does now, rise, admit his answer was wrong, correct the record, and fully apologize?","Mr. Speaker, my colleague is still in the environmental weeds on this question. \lineBreak As in previous years, our reporting is detailed and in full compliance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and it includes all emissions from the oil gas. \lineBreak There are three energy categories that contain the oil sands gas: fossil fuel production and refining, mining and oil and gas extraction, and fugitive sources. \lineBreak In response to queries, Environment Canada reduced a 6.5% estimate of those tonnages, which are in the United Nations report."
266,"Mr. Speaker, the Health Council of Canada is asking all levels of government to work together to strengthen our health care system. During the last session, the government asked the Senate to review the 2004 health accord. The Senate is an undemocratic institution that is not accountable to anyone. \lineBreak Will the government assign the responsibility of reviewing this important accord to the Standing Committee on Health, which is made up of elected members of Parliament?","Mr. Speaker, it is up to the health committee to determine what projects it wants to review. I have been very open with the health committee. If it wants to review the 2014 accord, it is more than welcome to do so. \lineBreak There is a statutory requirement, under the health accord, for a committee to review the 2014 accord. I asked the Senate to review that prior to the election. I am open to HESA conducting its own review as well."
267,"Mr. Speaker, this week marks two years since Iranians went to the polls to express their democratic will. The regime in Tehran responded with repression. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, we stand with our allies in condemning this regime and the crackdown that followed the election just two short years ago. It was absolutely brutal and totally uncalled for. \lineBreak Two years on, the repression continues, sadly, in Iran. Next door in Syria, Iranian officials are assisting the al-Assad regime's crackdown on the vulnerable people of Syria. \lineBreak We will work with the international community to increase pressure on these regimes. We stand with the people of Syria. We stand with the people of Iran who yearn to be free and to exercise their rights."
268,"Mr. Speaker, Gilbert Rozon's recent report on the performance of Quebec's tourism industry points out the multitude of aging attractions and the shortage of new projects. The report also highlights the lack of a common vision amongst the industry's players. \lineBreak Will this government commit to working closely with the Quebec government and industry stakeholders to develop a vision for the future of Quebec's tourism industry?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question and congratulate him on being elected. \lineBreak I have just come from Vancouver, where I met with representatives of the Canadian Tourism Commission. I can tell the hon. member that we are developing a tourism strategy for Canada. It is a very important industry. Last week, I met with my colleague, the tourism minister for Quebec. We are working for the tourism industry and we will soon have an effective strategy that responds to the public's requests."
269,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment and concerns oil and gas exploration. \lineBreak I certainly agree with hon. members of the official opposition about risks of oil and gas in British Columbia, but on the other coast while many areas have been developed, one has never been touched. \lineBreak  This is the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a most biologically productive region with over 2,000 marine species including endangered blue whales. It is now threatened by a deep water oil well. This is a region that touches five provinces. \lineBreak The minister has received the request for a joint panel. Could he tell this House if he agrees?","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on her first question on the environment in this House. I hope that our ongoing dialogue will continue to be based on facts and science. The government is committed to ensuring—"
270,"Order, please. I do not think the hon. minister was finished his reply. ","Mr. Speaker, I can confirm for my hon. colleague that I have received a request from the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board to refer the project to a review. I will consider the facts and make a decision in due course."
271,"Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order arising out of question period where the  \lineBreak I would like to give the minister an opportunity to correct the information by pointing out Bill ","That is not a point of order; it is a point of debate. If the member wants to expand on that, she can try to get it on the question period rotation list to do it then, but not on points of order."
272,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has invested billions of dollars in the National Research Council to develop the technologies we need to be competitive in the 21st century. \lineBreak The government has announced that it wants to trim the fat. Now it wants to cut 20% from the budget of the NRC, which employs people who could turn these technologies into jobs for Canadians. \lineBreak Does the government believe that investing in technologies for the future is pointless?","Mr. Speaker, our government's number one priority is the economy. That is why we have increased overall the NRC's budget by 17% to support research, to help businesses and to help the economy. \lineBreak On top of that funding, we provided temporary two year stimulus funding to the NRC under the economic action plan. As everybody should know, that ended on March 31."
273,"Mr. Speaker, any squandering of public money is unacceptable. The foolish spending on the G8 quite simply should not have happened. To quote someone who is well known in Canadian politics, “I can only hope that it is the last volume in a...spree of waste and wild spending....” Who said that? It was the former President of the Treasury Board and current  \lineBreak When will the Conservatives start showing some accountability to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my friend from  \lineBreak This is what the government did. We spent money fixing up an airport in North Bay. We spent money fixing up a provincial highway in southern Ontario. We built a community centre. Those are all good public infrastructure projects that will benefit people in these municipalities for many years to come. \lineBreak The Auditor General has come forward with some good advice and some good observations, and the government accepts all that good advice and will do better in the future."
274,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  \lineBreak The Auditor General called what he found “very unusual and troubling”.  \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, in fact, it was not $50 million. It was about 10% or 20% less than that. \lineBreak The Auditor General made some observations and recommendations to this government and to Parliament on how we could have greater transparency and openness. We have fully accepted those recommendations. \lineBreak While I am on my feet, let me thank Sheila Fraser for the outstanding job she has done for Canadians over the past 10 years."
275,"Mr. Speaker, as you said, it is time for the usual Thursday question. However, today, we find ourselves in circumstances that are anything but ordinary. There are only four days left before the scheduled end of this session. In these four days, we will see what the priorities of this government are because two days must be allotted for supply days. The budget must be adopted to cover the expenditures required for the proper functioning of the government. Two days are reserved for the opposition. Naturally, as we just saw in question period, there are attempts to rush the usual way of handling labour relations.  \lineBreak It will then be a matter of determining the government's priorities. For example, the budget implementation bill provides for an increase in the guaranteed income supplement. We do not believe that it is sufficient, but it is still worth supporting. It is interesting because this is directly related to what is currently happening with pensions. People are retiring without enough money to live on, and the government must help them. At the same time, government policies are such that more people will be retiring with insufficient income.  \lineBreak The question is this: what is the government's priority? Does it want to help seniors in need? Does it want to follow up on the proposal by my colleague from ","Mr. Speaker, I will give a complete answer by moving a motion. There have been consultations among the parties, and I believe that we will have unanimous consent on this motion. "
276,"Does the  \lineBreak 
								 \lineBreak 
								","Mr. Speaker, having dealt with that, I can provide a full answer to the question from my friend, the House leader of the official opposition. \lineBreak We will call Bill  \lineBreak As decided last week, the House will not sit tomorrow, as a courtesy to the New Democratic members, so they may attend their convention in Vancouver. \lineBreak On Monday, we will continue debating back-to-work matters. Tuesday, June 21, and Wednesday, June 22, shall be allotted days. On Thursday, we will complete report stage and third reading of Bill  \lineBreak Should developments arise relating to the current labour matters at Air Canada and Canada Post, it may be necessary to adjust the business of the House, and I will advise members accordingly when that arises."
277,"Mr. Speaker, we have learned that the  \lineBreak The rules require that expenses be authorized in advance and neither the PMO nor the PCO are following the rules. The  \lineBreak How is it that the ","Mr. Speaker, our government has cut spending on hospitality by more than 30% over and above the previous government's record. \lineBreak To be clear, measures were put in place some time ago to ensure that any necessary spending on coffee or on limited hospitality was in fact approved beforehand."
278,"Mr. Speaker, as is the case with his  \lineBreak A trip with friends and family to a hockey game in Boston, $100,000. Watching the government avoid the question, priceless. \lineBreak Why is it that the ","Again, Mr. Speaker, I am not exactly sure what the hon. member is going on about. \lineBreak Again, it is our government that has cut spending on hospitality by some 30%. We have in fact improved on the approval process. \lineBreak Just because we are reducing hospitality spending does not make us inhospitable. We are such warm people over here."
279,"Mr. Speaker, one of the things the minister just said was that she was trying to get the parties to focus on the issues.  \lineBreak It is very clear that one of the key issues is that workers who used to be able to rely on a defined benefit plan that would provide them with a degree of security are no longer able to rely on that security with respect to major employers in the country. This is a pattern that has been growing. The fact remains that the defined benefit provision has been one of the main pillars of the Canadian pension system. \lineBreak What is the government doing to make sure that this pillar does not simply crumble?","Mr. Speaker, in the context of the negotiations at the table, the parties have been able to narrowly define three or four issues that are in contention. Unfortunately, they have not been able to find a process or even come to an agreement themselves on those three issues. I encourage the parties to find their own way, find a process and come to an agreement. But if they cannot, today at three o'clock, we will be tabling back to work legislation."
280,"Mr. Speaker, I did not hear an answer to my question about pensions. This issue affects not just the workers at Canada Post, but all workers in the country. It is evident that there will be more strikes this year and next if we do not find a solution that provides more security for Canadian workers.","Mr. Speaker, in fact, it is this party that actually recognized the inconsistency with retirement income in this country.  \lineBreak We are working with our partners, the provinces and the territories. Over 63% of Canadians do not have either a defined benefit or a defined contribution plan. We are making sure that it is equal and fair for all Canadians."
281,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have failed again to seriously deal with the pension crisis facing Canada. \lineBreak Last week, all the  \lineBreak When is the government going to learn from the mistakes of others and start working to really help Canadians prepare for retirement?","Mr. Speaker, the only mistake we will not follow is that of the Liberal government that chose to do nothing about this. This situation did not just happen overnight. This has taken years to build. \lineBreak We have reduced taxes for seniors by $2 billion. That is an important benefit for them, but it is not all that they need. They need assistance in saving for their own retirement. That is what we are putting together in conjunction with the provinces. We will be bringing that idea forward to the House very soon, a shared plan with our partners in the provinces."
282,"Mr. Speaker, just before the recession, this government rolled out the red carpet for American companies that specialize in mortgage insurance. They invited the very companies responsible for the crash in the United States' housing market. With Bill  \lineBreak Why should taxpayers have to assume the risks run by these American companies?","Mr. Speaker, I really do not know where the hon. member gets her theoretical facts. \lineBreak What has happened in Canada is that we have had a solid housing market. We have not had the kinds of difficulties, thank goodness, that the United States, Ireland and other countries have had.  \lineBreak Why is that so? It is because we have a well run system, because we have mortgages with recourse, because we reduced amortization periods. It is because we watch the system and when intervention is necessary, we intervene, as we have done three times in the last three years."
283,"Mr. Speaker, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation was doing a very good job of providing mortgage insurance, and even returned a profit to Canadians. Yet the government opened the door to U.S. insurers, then pushed to relax the rules so these insurers could offer riskier mortgages, which they did. They encouraged people to sign on to mortgages they could not afford. \lineBreak Why is the government asking taxpayers to risk billions of dollars for these private companies when CMHC is a much more secure, more stable way of helping homebuyers? Why is that?","Mr. Speaker, I thought the question was actually about the housing record. It appears that the member is just concerned that private enterprise could have anything to do with business in Canada. \lineBreak We actually believe in private enterprise. We do not believe the public should take 100% of the risk in insured mortgages in Canada. \lineBreak The other thing the hon. member might want to think about is that it is important to have competition in that sector, as it is in every other sector in our economy. Everybody in that sector, public or private, plays by the same rules, and we set the rules."
284,"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been promising for years to reform the Senate but he broke his promise to have an elected Senate and to limit senators' terms. His record is clear. Like the previous governments he has so often criticized, he appointed his friends to the upper chamber. How ironic that those he appointed no longer want to give up their privileges. \lineBreak If the government's credibility is in doubt within its own caucus, how can it expect to have the support of this House?","Mr. Speaker, we believe that the Senate must change in order to reach its full potential as an accountable and democratic institution. The effectiveness and legitimacy of the Senate suffers because senators do not have a democratic mandate from Canadians and can serve terms as long as 45 years. \lineBreak Our government received a strong mandate. We are committed to acting quickly on reforming the Senate, so that it better reflects the values of Canada and Canadians in the 21st century."
285,"Mr. Speaker, it is time the government was clear with Canadians about the  \lineBreak My question is very simple. Why will the government not just support a straight-up referendum, asking Canadians, do they support abolishing the Senate, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, our government received a strong mandate to reform the Senate and implement our plan to make it more accountable. We believe Senate reform is the best option to address Canadians' concerns about senators serving terms up to 45 years without a democratic mandate. We are committed to reforming the Senate, so that it better reflects the values of Canada and Canadians in the 21st century."
286,"Mr. Speaker, it has been almost two weeks now since the Auditor General criticized the former industry minister's misuse and waste of public funds to benefit his friends. Yet the former minister has still not apologized and has not provided details on the projects that were chosen. This is becoming a habit. He also has not provided details on his plan for budget cuts. We have found out about some of them: the 40% cuts at the Canada Mortgage and Housing corporation, the 20% cuts at Environment Canada and the millions of dollars in cuts at the Canada Revenue Agency. \lineBreak When will the minister start acting like a real minister?","Mr. Speaker, I am happy to describe some of these projects and what was done. There is an airport in North Bay. The government helped resurface the runway so that planes could land on it. \lineBreak There is a provincial highway in that part of rural Ontario that was repaved. That is important. A community centre was also built. It is now available for the benefit of the people in that municipality, and I could go on."
287,"Mr. Speaker, the 2011-12 main estimates will soon be examined in parliamentary committee. The President of the Treasury Board has agreed to testify, but only for one hour. But we think that it must have taken much more than an hour to set up his $50 million plan for the G8 summit to benefit his friends. \lineBreak Could the minister himself, or his foreign affairs critic, explain why we are allowed only one hour to discuss the management of $250 billion?","Mr. Speaker, a question for me that has to do with my portfolio. I want to state to the House that I am looking forward to going to the government operations committee to defend our estimates. We have a strong mandate from the people of Canada to move ahead with the right kind of strategy, the right kind of agenda for Canada and Canadians, and we are darn proud of it."
288,"Mr. Speaker, I was reading the 2011 ethical guide for cabinet ministers and I notice the government rewrote it to say that ministers must obey the law. I find it astonishing that ministers must be told that “Thou shall not collude nor conspire to create a coven of kleptocracy in Canada”. \lineBreak The minister blew through $50 million without documentation. Did the Conservatives have to rewrite the rules so none of the other ministers were as cavalier with the public trust?","Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker."
289,"Mr. Speaker, there was another change in the guide that jumped out at me. Civil servants are now told that even if the minister compels them, they are obliged to follow the rules. Was this why the member for  \lineBreak How else could he have gotten the three amigos, the mayor, the hotel manager and the minister, to divvy up $50 million on outhouses, picnic tables and bike racks without documentation? How else could he have gotten away with it?","Mr. Speaker, try as the member might, he is not the member for Winnipeg North Centre. \lineBreak I am pleased to confirm to the House and to my friend opposite that none of the three individuals he mentioned approved any of the 32 projects. "
290,"Mr. Speaker, the government hopes that if it keeps piling on the paperwork, Toronto businesses will eventually forget about seeking G20 compensation and just quietly go away. Toronto businesses inside and around the G20 zone suffered millions in damages and they are not going away. It has now been a year without compensation and these folks are still suffering.  \lineBreak The minister claimed he is ready to move forward and expedite this, but after a year the question is, when?","Mr. Speaker, I share the member opposite's concern. Many small businesses were really affected due to the security issues surrounding the holding of the summit in Toronto.  \lineBreak The member opposite raised this question two weeks ago and then again last week. I asked him if there were any specific businesses that I could specifically look into on his behalf. I am very prepared to do that. I think he and my colleague, our friend from "
291,"Mr. Speaker, we know the government's waste fighter-in-chief sprayed $50 million around his riding with no oversight and no paperwork. Now we learn that the department of the  \lineBreak So if the ","Mr. Speaker, again, our government has cut spending on hospitality by more than 30% over the government that the member served in. To be clear, we put measures in place. In fact, they were put in place some time ago to make sure that any necessary spending on coffee or limited hospitality was approved beforehand. \lineBreak We respect taxpayers' dollars on this side of the House, and we spend each and every dollar with due care. "
292,"Mr. Speaker, over the past two years, this government has spent $1 million trying to sell the international community on an idea that no one wants to buy: carbon capture and storage. Our partners know that this technology is inadequate. \lineBreak How can the minister justify spending $1 million on trying to sell this unproven technology? Does he not realize that he is only damaging our international reputation even further?","Mr. Speaker, I would refer my colleague to the case of Saskatchewan where, after a wise investment of $242 million and a pilot project on carbon capture, the Government of Saskatchewan found that, in fact, the technology does work and announced the investment of $1 billion into a carbon capture project."
293,"Mr. Speaker, we know what works and the government keeps promising energy efficiency, but it is failing to deliver. The government claimed that there were greenhouse gas reductions through the eco-energy retrofit program and the renewables program, but it is letting these programs lapse. Instead of increasing investment in renewable energy, the government spent $1 million lobbying the U.S.  \lineBreak Why will the minister not wake up to the fact that Canada needs real investment in technologies that work and not more investment in the lobbying industry?","Mr. Speaker, with regard to our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and hit our 2020 targets, we are on course and proceeding in that direction.  \lineBreak With regard to communications with Washington, that is a matter for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to communicate, where needed, with those who are under-informed or misinformed."
294,"Mr. Speaker, the Rotterdam convention meeting on hazardous material starts today in Geneva. \lineBreak In 2006 and 2008, the government blocked chrysotile asbestos from being added to the list against Health Canada's recommendations. Now the eyes of the world are back on the government to see if Canada will finally do the right thing. \lineBreak I have a simple question. Will the government allow chrysotile asbestos to be added to the Rotterdam convention, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, our position at Rotterdam will be the same as in Canada. For over 30 years the Government of Canada has promoted the safe and controlled use of chrysotile, both domestically and internationally. All scientific reviews clearly confirm that chrysotile fibres can be used safely under controlled conditions."
295,"Mr. Speaker, the member does not seem to understand that the Rotterdam Convention specifies that countries must ensure that hazardous material is handled safely. By opposing this classification, the Conservatives are putting the lives of many workers around the world in danger. Even former Conservative minister Chuck Strahl has denounced this position. He had the courage to take a stand.  \lineBreak Will the current Conservative members do the same and agree that asbestos should be classified as a hazardous material? ","Mr. Speaker, the Chrysotile Institute is mandated by the federal government, the Government of Quebec and chrysotile workers' unions to promote the safe and controlled use of chrysotile here in Canada and internationally."
296,"Mr. Speaker, let us get the facts straight: the National Research Council of Canada is the Government of Canada's premier organization for research and development. Yet we have learned that the Conservatives were going to cut the NRC's budget by 20%. The government's fiscal dogmatism is ruining the future of research in Canada. \lineBreak Does this government realize that with this type of policy, it is only encouraging a brain drain toward countries with a vision for the future?","Mr. Speaker, our government's number one priority is the economy. That is why we have increased our investments in the NRC by 17% to support more research, help businesses grow, and deliver results for Canadians. \lineBreak On top of that, we provided temporary two-year stimulus funding for the NRC under the economic action plan. That ended on March 31."
297,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak This decision falls under the same category as the abolition of the long form census: less research, less data, less information, less accountability to the public.  \lineBreak What does this government have against truth and knowledge?","Mr. Speaker, I answered the question regarding the National Research Council. \lineBreak With regard to the census, which the hon. member brings up, the government decided to bring in a different regime that does not threaten Canadians with jail time and fines simply because they do not want to tell the government what their religion is, or how many bedrooms they have in their house, or how much time they spend with their kids. Canadians find that, obviously, reasonable. We just fought an election and Canadians gave this government a strong mandate to continue in the direction we are going."
298,"Mr. Speaker, last week, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, said that housing is severely unaffordable for most households in large Canadian cities. The mortgage on the average home eats up 43% of household income before taxes. \lineBreak How can families meet their needs without going into debt when they have to spend so much money just to pay their mortgage? How far does this stranglehold have to go before the government finally decides to take action?","Mr. Speaker, I can assure members that is not what the Governor of the Bank of Canada said last week. What the governor of the bank indicated is that he had some concern in some sectors of the economy, particularly in the Vancouver condo market, with respect to some evidence of excessive prices, and that is so. \lineBreak However, if we look at the Canadian housing market across the board in Canada, there is comfort to be taken. We took another step this year to reduce amortization periods and to require higher down payments. It is working. We are seeing some moderation in the housing market in Canada. That is desirable, but homeowners should bear in mind that interest rates have nowhere to go but up and they should consider that as they plan for the future."
299,"Mr. Speaker, the government is once again telling people to fend for themselves. Mr. Carney said that home owners are even more vulnerable in today's crises than they were 10 years ago. Today, people either cannot afford to buy a house or they are at risk of losing the one they have. \lineBreak Does the government understand that part of its role is to ensure that Canadians have access to safe and affordable housing?","Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is looking for a housing crisis, she should look south of the border. \lineBreak We do not wish that on our neighbours in the United States, but the reality is that their housing crisis continues. There is a danger of a prolonged housing crisis in the United States. \lineBreak That is not so in Canada and that is because we regulate, we supervise, we monitor, and we have fiscal responsibility in terms of the housing sector in Canada, a very different place."
300,"Mr. Speaker, the more time goes by, the longer Henk Tepper, a New Brunswick farmer, remains imprisoned in Lebanon as a result of a commercial dispute in Algeria. \lineBreak The more time goes by, the longer the Conservative ministers remain guilty of failing to take action to help Mr. Tepper. Yesterday was Father's Day, but no one in Mr. Tepper's family was able to see him. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, we are very concerned about this case and for Mr. Tepper's family here in Canada. We know it is a very difficult time for them. \lineBreak Consular officials in Lebanon have been actively providing consular support and assistance to Mr. Tepper and his family since his arrest, including regular visits to ensure his well-being and health. \lineBreak Officials will continue to engage with senior Lebanese officials on this case."
301,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday was Father's Day, but Henk Tepper, a New Brunswick potato farmer, could not see his kids because he has been in a Lebanese prison for almost three months as a result of a commercial dispute in Algeria. \lineBreak Mr. Tepper's family is not interested in an international law lecture from the minister. They want the government to take its solemn responsibility to do something, protect its citizens and intervene now to bring Mr. Tepper home to Canada. \lineBreak The ","Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that Mr. Tepper and his family have been actively supported with consular assistance during the time since his arrest. \lineBreak There are regular visits, regular contact. I can assure the member that we will continue to liaise with officials in Lebanon on this case."
302,"Mr. Speaker, it made sense, in a way, when I learned last week that the  \lineBreak He has displayed a wilful blindness to any reason, or logic, or democracy, or even economics when it comes to his irrational, ideological crusade to legislate out of business the largest and most successful grain marketing company in the world. \lineBreak If the government is so determined to destroy this great Canadian institution, where is the business case? Where is the cost benefit analysis? Where is the impact study? Where is the liability assessment?","Mr. Speaker, I will try to give the member opposite some reason and logic and that is that our government has always supported farmers and farmers support us because of that. \lineBreak They have given us a strong mandate. They want us to fulfill our commitments. One of those commitments was to give western Canadian farmers the same marketing choice that the rest of the farmers across Canada have and we will do that."
303,"Mr. Speaker, I have had phone calls from prairie grain producers who admit they voted for Conservatives but who are furious that they are going to dismantle the Canadian Wheat Board. \lineBreak The grain producers told me they were always led to understand that the minister would allow them to have a vote, as the legislation says, on the future of how they want to market their grain. \lineBreak If the government wants to give prairie farmers more choice in how they get to market their grain, why will it not let them have the democratic vote that is statutorily theirs in the legislation?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite actually did say something about monopolies. He said they have a monopoly and a monopoly has to be regulated or reined in, or it cannot be allowed to exist. Is that not the socialist heartbeat: regulate, rein in, or obliterate?  \lineBreak We have a better way and that is to give freedom to western Canadian farmers, freedom to make their own decisions, freedom to take advantage of opportunities, freedom to do well and freedom to market their own products."
304,"Mr. Speaker, today the WTO released the Canadian trade policy review. The report praises Canada's strong economic performance during the global recession and commends Canada's aggressive pro-trade plan. \lineBreak According to the report, Canada's considerably expanded free trade agreement agenda marks a departure with its past practice. We all know the NDP is firmly and ideologically opposed to free trade as we heard during its convention. Despite this opposition, could the minister explain why we will continue aggressively pursuing a free trade agenda?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for  \lineBreak  Unlike the NDP, we recognize that one in five Canadian jobs is directly or indirectly related to trade and to exports. In order to protect and strengthen the financial security of hard-working Canadians, we will continue to pursue a low-tax free trade plan because we know it will create jobs. Canadians understand that this is a kitchen-table issue and we are pleased the World Trade Organization has acknowledged the merits of our job-creating pro-trade plan."
305,"Mr. Speaker, the government claims to be acting in good faith. Let us see. Our collective bargaining system is based on good faith. In the case of Canada Post, it was the government itself, through a crown corporation, that locked out Canada Post employees. This same government is now turning around, pointing at the situation it created, and saying that it must put an end to the lockout it created by introducing a special law to break workers' rights.  \lineBreak Is that acting in good faith?","Mr. Speaker, Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers have had an ample amount of time to discuss their issues at a bargaining table and, indeed, to use the collective bargaining process. \lineBreak We have been part of that, too. What we have been doing is facilitating, either through conciliation or mediation, or indeed through my trying to bring the parties to focus their attention on the issues, because, at the end of the day, the work stoppage affects all Canadians, small businesses and charities, and that is what needs to be addressed."
306,"Mr. Speaker, the government is threatening back to work legislation for Canada Post workers. \lineBreak However, the limited rolling strike is not what disrupted Canada's mail services. It was the lockout of 9,000 mail carriers by Canada Post. At stake are pensions, health and safety conditions, and fair wages for the next generation of Canadian workers. \lineBreak Why is the government interfering in these negotiations and trampling on free collective bargaining?","Mr. Speaker, as we stated before, the parties to the dispute have been unable to attain a collective bargaining agreement thus far. \lineBreak That is why the Canadian government is proposing to introduce back to work legislation. That is exactly what I will do today at 3 o'clock."
307,"Mr. Speaker, that is going to take rights away from workers. \lineBreak Canada Post employees took legitimate measures to assert their rights. The employees decided to stand up for their rights, but they also decided to continue serving the population. The employer decided otherwise. Canada Post decided that it did not care about the Canadian people or the service it is supposed to provide. \lineBreak Why not denounce the employer's position? Why is the government going to reward this attitude with back-to-work legislation?","Mr. Speaker, it is both parties at the table who are negotiating and who have been unable to attain an agreement. \lineBreak  That is why we are acting on behalf of Canadians, on behalf of small businesses, on behalf of charities, who are being affected by this work stoppage across the country. As I said, that is exactly why we will be introducing back to work legislation today."
308,"Mr. Speaker, finally aboriginal people in Canada have the right to challenge discriminatory treatment under the Canadian Human Rights Act. However, the national chief has made it clear that first nations lack the capacity and resources to effectively implement those changes. The Canadian Human Rights Commission itself has said the government's approach could perpetuate discrimination instead of ending it.  \lineBreak When will the government end the obstruction and provide the resources so 100% of aboriginal peoples can achieve full equality?","Mr. Speaker, this is Aboriginal Awareness Week and that is something I would encourage all members to participate in. There are many activities going on in the capital region and across the country. \lineBreak I thank the member for recognizing that the Canadian Human Rights Act now applies to on-reserve first nations as of Saturday, a very important event, something we can celebrate. We believe that first nation governments will accommodate themselves to this very readily."
309,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has been waiting for 28 CH-148 Cyclone helicopters since 2004. These delays have cost Canada $6.2 billion. The  \lineBreak While Canadian families are tightening their belts, how can the government allow large military companies to take advantage of us by failing to collect the money we are owed?","Mr. Speaker, when we sign a contract with a military supplier, we expect its obligations under the contract to be met. The first interim maritime helicopter has arrived at 12 Wing Shearwater to support training of Canadian Forces air crew and technicians for the maritime helicopter project. It is important to know that Sikorsky has confirmed that it will deliver the 28 fully compliant maritime helicopters on schedule starting in June of this year."

They were introduced today by the Bank of Canada. Canadians will see their story in the new banknotes. Our spirit of innovation and our achievements at home, around the world and even in space.

This was achieved with the oversight of former national security adviser, Margaret Bloodworth, and the former auditor general, Denis Desautels. \lineBreak These savings will provide the room to continue paying down debt and investing in the priorities of Canadians, including lowering taxes for families. \lineBreak Retirement and attrition will provide the public service with the flexibility to manage these decisions without substantial job losses."
312,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government is staying silent on the messy issue of Montreal's south shore bridges. \lineBreak The Mercier Bridge is blocked off, when it is not falling to pieces, much like the Champlain Bridge. People are having a heck of a time getting to work, and we are going to tell them an emergency committee needs to be struck because no one is talking. Montreal is being taken hostage by a lack of transparency, leadership and communication. \lineBreak What is the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his interest in helping us improve the highway network in the greater Montreal area. \lineBreak As always, respecting our partners' jurisdictions is immensely important for our government, whether our partners are at the municipal level, or at the provincial level, as is the case for provincial highways. The Quebec government and the federal government each own 50% of the Mercier Bridge. I will be pleased to continue working with my colleague to improve things for the people of Montreal."
313,"Mr. Speaker, by threatening to pass special legislation, the Conservatives are causing harm to postal workers by preventing an agreement negotiated in good faith. Knowing that the government will table special legislation as soon as a strike is declared, the employer has no interest in considering employees' legitimate demands. On the contrary, the employer is attempting to have the special legislation tabled sooner by imposing a lockout. \lineBreak Is this not the ","Mr. Speaker, at 12:15 this afternoon, I sat in on a conference call with both the president of the union and the president of Canada Post urging them both equally. to find a way through this impasse, find a process that works for them, to conclude their collective bargaining and come to an agreement. At this point in time it is harming nobody but the Canadian public, businesses and charities. That is why, in a few short minutes, we will be introducing back to work legislation."
314,"Mr. Speaker, during question period, I made reference to my friend as the member from Winnipeg North Centre. I should have said the member for ",I am sure the House appreciates that.
315,"Mr. Speaker, for the second year in a row massive flooding is damaging Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Another five inches of rain fell this past weekend in places like Yellow Grass, Radville, Weyburn, Estevan and Roche Percee. Infrastructure has again been eroded and millions of acres of farmland will not get seeded again. The western premiers want a better national response to such disasters.  \lineBreak Could premiers Wall and Selinger be assured today that the federal government would support a new national disaster strategy with greater federal compensation and more investment in prevention in the first place?","Mr. Speaker, we do share concerns with the provinces that are experiencing flooding. Our government is committed to helping the provinces, whether it be Manitoba, Saskatchewan, or Quebec, to help mitigate the disaster and afterward. We are committed to supporting all provinces with any flooding situation."
316,"Mr. Speaker, the employees of Canada Post used legitimate pressure tactics to defend their rights while continuing to deliver the mail. The response from Canada Post, which is owned by the government, was to lock the doors and suspend mail delivery. The special back-to-work legislation clearly takes the employer’s side. \lineBreak The government and Canada Post came to an agreement in advance, did they not?","Mr. Speaker, this dispute between Canada Post and the union has been going on for a long time now, and this is causing growing damage to the Canadian economy and Canadians. This government is acting to protect the interests of Canadians. "
317,"Mr. Speaker, this is not a strike called by the workers. It is a lockout imposed by the management of Canada Post. It is the government's mess. \lineBreak Now it is forcing through legislation what it could not claw back through negotiation. With this bill, the government is imposing wages that are lower than what management was prepared to offer these workers who deliver our mail. \lineBreak Is the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, there has been a series of strikes and lockouts in a dispute between these two parties that is beginning to damage a large number of people who do not sit at the table. \lineBreak The government is acting to protect those interests. The wage rates laid out in the legislation are the rates that this government agreed to with its other public service workers, and that is a fair settlement for Canada Post workers as well."
318,"Mr. Speaker, it has been two weeks since the  \lineBreak There is a criminal investigation into how $50 million was diverted into his riding. I suggest the RCMP read the Auditor General's report, which lays out in excruciating detail how the three amigos, the mayor, the hotel manager and the minister, diverted money for these dubious pork barrel projects. \lineBreak My question to the missing member for ","Mr. Speaker, another day and another public relations stunt from the opposition. \lineBreak Let us look at what the interim Auditor General said in his report. I would remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the Auditor General is an independent officer of Parliament, mandated to report to this House. The report says: \lineBreak It also says: \lineBreak The Auditor General has made some fair observations about the process with which the estimates are presented to this House, and how grants and contributions programs could be administered. We fully accept that good counsel and will be following it in the future."
319,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote the man who has disappeared in this House, who said yesterday in committee that it was factually incorrect to say that money was diverted. Page 37 in the Auditor General's report clearly contradicts him. If he wants to take that up with the cops, I am sure it is going to go very well for him. \lineBreak I would like to say to this House that if he gets away with this $50 million scheme, then start counting the spoons and silverware dear public because they have just given this man the keys to the Treasury Board.","Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comment made by the member opposite. I did not hear a question."
320,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I once again asked the member for  \lineBreak The President of the Treasury Board still refuses to address this matter in the House. Today, we understand why: the RCMP is conducting an investigation.  \lineBreak Is the RCMP carrying out an investigation because, as the Auditor General has indicated, this spending is completely unjustifiable?","Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. The member opposite said overspending. In fact, this fund was under spent by more than $5 million.  \lineBreak The money was spent on each of the 32 infrastructure projects. Every single penny was accounted for. Every construction project was on time. Costs came in under budget and all costs recorded were used for the purposes intended. In terms of documentation, there is an individual contribution agreement for each of the 32 projects."
321,"Mr. Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board is attempting to spend $50 million without justification; however, this is so suspicious that it has sparked an RCMP investigation.  \lineBreak  We are now realizing that this government’s actions look a lot like what the Liberals did during the sponsorship scandal. The same practices lead to the same outcomes, and that is why the RCMP is investigating this dubious spending.  \lineBreak  Will the President of the Treasury Board co-operate with the RCMP and provide all relevant documents? ","Mr. Speaker, let us be frank, there is a public relations stunt going forward. The interim Auditor General has spoken very strongly to this issue. I have read two specific quotes when he released his report. He came forward with some legitimate concerns about grants and contributions. He came forward with some legitimate observations on how we can report to Parliament in a more open and transparent way. We fully accepted the good advice of the Auditor General."
322,"Mr. Speaker, one year after the G20 summit in Toronto, we are learning new details about that monumental fiasco.  \lineBreak  The charges laid against 100 or so students who were sleeping in the University of Toronto gymnasium have been dropped because the police had no warrant when they made the arrests. A warrant is a necessary prerequisite in our justice system. \lineBreak  When will this government commit itself to holding a public inquiry to shed light on the mismanagement and the record arrests at the G8 and G20 summits? ","Mr. Speaker, Canada was responsible for the safety and security of all those involved in the summits, from world leaders, visitors, delegates, and those who lived in the surrounding areas. If the member has any specific concerns about police conduct, he should take those up concerns with the appropriate authorities."
323,"Mr. Speaker, it has been a year since the G20 summit in Toronto. It was not only a mismanaged boondoggle, it was the largest mass arrest in Canada's history and Canadians are now shocked to learn that it was completely unnecessary. Well over half of those detained had their charges dropped. Only a handful have been convicted. Clearly something went wrong. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite is aware, specific bodies exist to handle complaints regarding the conduct of police. As I have said many times before, I encourage anyone who has a complaint in respect of any specific incident to bring it forward to the appropriate body. In this case, it would be a provincial body."
324,"Mr. Speaker, the G20 summit is truly a blot on Canadian history. Many women were arrested and strip-searched, they were denied access to hygiene products and they were not even able to go to the toilet without being constantly within the sight of police officers. Many cases of sexual harassment have also been reported. Only a public inquiry into the mismanagement of the G20 summit will get to the bottom of things and restore public confidence. \lineBreak My question is simple: When is the government going to announce a public inquiry? When is the government going to take action?","Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite knows, there are in fact processes in place to deal with these types of concerns. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any disciplinary or criminal procedure, but I would encourage the member, if she has specific knowledge about any specific event, to take that to the appropriate provincial authority and allow the authorities who are designated to deal with these complaints to handle them appropriately."
325,"Mr. Speaker, we now know there has been an outcome in the Muskoka scandal. In reply to a letter that our former colleague Marlene Jennings wrote to the director of public prosecutions, there is now an RCMP investigation into an apparent misappropriation of funds in the riding of the current  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, let us just call this what it is. This is a defeated Liberal candidate in the last election who was pulling off a public relations stunt rather than focusing on the issues that really matter to Canadians. \lineBreak Let me say this. The Auditor General, in releasing his report, said two things: one, that there was no evidence to suggest that it was a deliberate attempt to mislead and, two, he was not aware of any specific law that was broken. Obviously the Auditor General's report that was tabled in the House is substantially different from the one involved in the Liberal public relations stunt."
326,"Mr. Speaker, today is National Aboriginal Day, and New Democrats join in paying tribute to all first nations, Métis and Inuit people's cultures and traditions. \lineBreak Three years after I joined with the  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, what I would say is that while much work remains to be done, considerable progress has been made over the past several years in areas such as education, human rights, water services, schools, and many other areas for aboriginal people in this country. More work remains to be done.  \lineBreak However, I do want to congratulate all aboriginal Canadians on this day, and also acknowledge and pay tribute to the growing number of aboriginal Canadians elected to serve in the Parliament of Canada."
327,"Mr. Speaker, the reality is that three years after an apology was given to aboriginal people, virtually nothing has changed. Too many aboriginal communities have been abandoned to their fate. Access to education is dramatically lower than elsewhere. Many people have trouble accessing clean drinking water, and the housing situation is deplorable. Families are piled on top of one another. \lineBreak We thank the ","Mr. Speaker, improving the quality of life for all first nations across Canada is a priority for the government. \lineBreak A vital component of this is the elimination of poverty. The average income among first nations on reserve is 45% of the non-aboriginal population. The income assistance dependency rate is high at 35% compared to the national average of 5%. \lineBreak The preferred approach that we have been taking is targeted. We are addressing these challenges through negotiated tripartite approaches involving Canada, the provinces, the territories and first nations."
328,"Mr. Speaker, today, on National Aboriginal Day, we reflect on the struggles and achievements of first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. \lineBreak As parliamentarians we must deliver on the commitments under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Assembly of First Nations and the Inuit have issued calls for investment in education. As National Chief Shawn Atleo has said, “Now is the time to realize Shannen's dream”. \lineBreak Will the government, today, commit to equitable access to quality education for all children?","Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say that today we launched the national panel on K to 12 education. \lineBreak I did that jointly with National Chief Atleo on National Aboriginal Day with a very large and significant crowd of students and teachers. I think it was a most appropriate measure. We have also launched our website for people to consult beyond the round tables. I direct people to go there."
329,"Mr. Speaker, the London Stock Exchange is trying to take over the TMX to gain control of Canadian capital markets. New concerns are being raised throughout the country concerning the takeover of the TMX, including those voiced by the Premier of Quebec and by other provinces. Now more than ever we need a public consultation process. \lineBreak Why is the minister refusing to listen to the Canadian public? Why is he refusing to hold public hearings on this matter?","Mr. Speaker, the minister has received an application for a review under the Investment Canada Act from the London Stock Exchange Group.  \lineBreak The minister's officials are conducting a thorough analysis of this proposed investment and will consult extensively, including with affected provinces and territories, to ensure that they have all of the information required to make the best decision. \lineBreak It should be noted that the minister will only approve applications where an investment demonstrates that it is likely to be of net benefit to Canadians."
330,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives seem to like secretive closed-door decisions. The NDP welcomes public input. That is the difference. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak Canadians do not want more secrecy. Canadians want public consultations. What does the government have against open and transparent public consultations?","Mr. Speaker, foreign investment is the key to the growth of the Canadian economy and our government will continue to encourage it. \lineBreak The hon. member is new to the industry committee, but he might consult with his colleague who was on the committee in the previous Parliament when we put forward a motion to study the Investment Canada Act. It was consistently delayed by opposition members."
331,"Mr. Speaker, a large part of our economic success is attributable to the dynamism of small and medium-sized businesses, which generate approximately 70% of jobs in Canada. Rather than supporting this driver of our economy, the Conservative government prefers to cut the taxes of big corporations, which are already raking in gargantuan profits.  \lineBreak When will this government take concrete action to support the real creators of jobs in this country, the small and medium-sized businesses? ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform my colleague that this government has taken concrete action, and has been doing so for quite some time. Right from the outset, when we were first elected, we reduced the small business tax rate from 12% to 11% in our first budget, in 2006-2007. We continued to do so in subsequent budgets, helping to increase the turnaround for small businesses from $300,000 to $500,000, and so on and so forth. I am very disappointed that my opposition colleague did not vote for our last budget, which once again helped Canadian small businesses to be more successful."
332,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have no job creation strategy. \lineBreak In the election campaign, our party announced that it wanted to generate concrete jobs in Canada through SMEs. In concrete terms, we proposed a tax credit for job creation. We proposed a tax cut for small businesses from 11% to 9%. \lineBreak  Is the government willing to listen to these ideas and take action in order to stimulate job creation?","Mr. Speaker, we know that business people create jobs throughout Canada, whether in Beauce, Vancouver or Newfoundland. We support these business people. The recent budget proves this. \lineBreak  I would like to remind my colleague that since the last recession, 500,000 new jobs were created here in Canada thanks to these business people, and we are going to continue to support them. That is why we are here, to create jobs. The economy is our top priority, and I would like the NDP to make the economy its top priority, too. "

It will be a great time for Canada."
334,"Mr. Speaker, the 2011 budget talks about introducing rules for prepaid credit cards and credit cheque advances, without explaining how it will be done. \lineBreak With household debt skyrocketing, we need a strategy now. \lineBreak Will the government commit to introducing comprehensive legislation that would protect consumers from being gouged by credit companies and will the government commit to a timeline for introducing this legislation?","Mr. Speaker, with respect to the last part of the question, that would be in the subsequent budget implementation acts following the one that is before the House now. \lineBreak We have already brought in credit card regulations, as I am sure the member opposite knows, requiring clear and simple information, timely advance notice of rates and fee changes, and limiting any consumer business practices. \lineBreak There is more to be done. It is outlined in the budget."
335,"Mr. Speaker, Statistics Canada reported yesterday that household debt has skyrocketed again to a record new level. The household debt-to-income ratio is now around 150%. The federal deficit-to-income ratio, by comparison, is just 34%. \lineBreak When will the government stop blaming Canadians and act to protect consumers from the predatory practices of credit card companies?","Mr. Speaker, as I understand the strange position, the contradictory position, taken by the member opposite, he is saying that the government ought to act to restrict credit at the same time that we ought to encourage consumer confidence, economic activity, job creation, and growth in the country. Those are contradictory goals. \lineBreak We have said to Canadians very clearly that interest rates have only one way to go, and that is up, over time, and they ought to be prudent in their spending.  \lineBreak We have not seen any evidence of any imprudence, in terms of the Canadian housing market."
336,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday Statistics Canada confirmed the seriousness of the household debt crisis in Canada. On average, there is a $1.50 debt for every dollar earned. The list of experts sounding the alarm is growing longer: the Bank of Canada, Statistics Canada, CGA-Canada. Everyone criticizes the, quote, disastrous situation for indebted families.  \lineBreak  How can the government justify its inaction in the face of this family debt crisis?","Mr. Speaker, interest rates have been low for some time, as I am sure the member opposite appreciates. That has meant some continued economic growth, moderate economic growth in Canada, which is welcome. \lineBreak We anticipate, as the private sector economists do, that we will continue to have that moderate economic growth in Canada, which will lead us to balanced budgets."
337,"Mr. Speaker, the real problem is that the government has left Canadian families to their fate with their record debt levels. Families are no longer able to save for their future or their children’s future. \lineBreak The indifference of the Conservatives is a threat to all our futures. Will the government finally protect consumers rather than the profits of the big banks?","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian economy is in good shape. It is the best shape in the G7. The IMF says so. \lineBreak The Conference Board of Canada says: \lineBreak  Canada is doing well."
338,"Mr. Speaker, last month the Federal Court ordered a judicial review in the case of over 750 fishermen involved in the Atlantic groundfish licence retirement program, who have been fighting for fairness before the court since 2006. \lineBreak Fishermen in this program were not treated equally or fairly, and paid thousands of dollars more in taxes than they should have. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I can inform the House and those fishers in Atlantic Canada affected directly by this court case that the government will not appeal this decision, and CRA will now reconsider the fishers' claim as requested by the Federal Court. \lineBreak I would also remind the House that our government created the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, along with the Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsman. We have the absolute expectation that CRA administers Canadian tax law in a manner that is fair and consistent for all Canadians."
339,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's position on asbestos is morally and ethically reprehensible, and even as we speak, teams of Department of Justice lawyers have been dispatched to Geneva to sabotage the Rotterdam Convention once again, the list of hazardous chemicals that require prior informed consent to trade. \lineBreak Canada is already an international pariah for its policy on asbestos, for dumping it into the third world when we will not use it ourselves.  \lineBreak How can we in all good conscience block efforts to put labels on asbestos to warn its recipients to take health and safety protections against this class A carcinogen? What kind of country are we?","Mr. Speaker, for over 30 years the Government of Canada has promoted the safe and controlled use of chrysotile, both domestically and internationally.  \lineBreak Our position at Rotterdam is the same as it is in Canada. All scientific reviews clearly confirm that chrysotile fibres can be used safely under controlled situations."
340,"Mr. Speaker, public health experts and occupational health experts the world over agree that there is no safe way to use asbestos. \lineBreak Not a single reliable study in the world shows that asbestos can be used safely, as the  \lineBreak Asbestos should be added to the Rotterdam Convention. \lineBreak  How can the minister continue to defend the indefensible?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, all the recent scientific reviews show that chrysotile can be used in a safe and controlled manner. The Chrysotile Institute is mandated by the federal government, the Government of Quebec and the chrysotile workers unions to support the attempts to promote the safe and controlled use of chrysotile in Canada and around the world."
341,"Mr. Speaker, the label of tough on crime is not something that Canadians would generally associate with the Liberal Party. In fact, quite the opposite. \lineBreak Yet today, in an attempt to change the channel, a Liberal senator has been discussing his views on how our government should deal with crime. Interestingly, he describes keeping dangerous criminals off the street as a folly. I am sure victims of crime and members of the House would strongly disagree. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for his support of legislation to protect victims of crime. \lineBreak Canadians gave our Conservative government a strong mandate to get tough on crime, and we will not apologize for putting the protection of law-abiding Canadians first. That is why we have made significant investments in the RCMP. We have seen recruitment numbers boosted to record levels that former governments could only dream about. \lineBreak  Unlike the NDP and the Liberal Party, we will not put criminals back on the street early just to save a buck."
342,"Mr. Speaker, on November 4 last year, a young Canadian, Colin Rutherford, was kidnapped in Afghanistan and accused of being a spy. \lineBreak His kidnappers have contacted Canadian officials with their demands. His family has not been told what the demands are. Once again, a Canadian overseas needs the help of the government.  \lineBreak Other than lip service, what have the ","Mr. Speaker, the government is aware of this case. \lineBreak Due to security and privacy concerns, it would be absolutely inappropriate for us to comment on this case."
343,"Mr. Speaker, the government's lack of transparency around visitor visas is causing heartache for families right across Canada at times of weddings and funerals. \lineBreak One in five will be denied a visa this year. For Newton—North Delta, the percentage is much higher. Visitors have no idea why they are rejected or what they can do to qualify. People are frustrated and they want answers. \lineBreak Will the government implement a transparent and open appeal process for visas?","Mr. Speaker, under our immigration law, for decades the power to decide which foreign nationals can enter Canada and receive temporary resident visas has been delegated to independent, highly trained members of our professional public service, our visa officers. \lineBreak Consistently over the past several decades, about 20% of visa applications have not been approved. That has been constant through changes of government and changes of law. \lineBreak It is visa officers' responsibility to make sure that people demonstrate their bona fide intentions to return back to their countries of origin. We commend our public servants for doing important work.  \lineBreak We ask applicants to submit documents that are complete and applications that demonstrate their intention to return home."
344,"Mr. Speaker, for months the current Syrian regime has been engaged in a brutal crackdown on its own people. \lineBreak Yesterday the current Syrian president went on Syrian television to address the crisis. Rather than giving the Syrian people the real reforms they were seeking, he dealt in generalities and gave no real timeline for any reforms. \lineBreak Today the security forces killed even more people. Can the ","Mr. Speaker, our government and I believe all Canadians strongly support the people of Syria in their peaceful efforts to realize democracy and human rights. \lineBreak Syrians have endured terrible crimes at the hands of this regime. Canada has joined several of our allies in saying that the president of Syria has a choice: he can reform or he can go. The status quo is no longer acceptable. \lineBreak While Canada does not have a Syrian ambassador posted in our country, I want to tell my friends opposite and on the government side of the House that the government has summoned the chargé d'affaires on three occasions since the protests began, on April 29, June 3 and as recently as June 15."
345,"Mr. Speaker, the Quebec Bridge is the longest cantilever bridge in the world. The preservation of this architectural jewel and the safety of a bridge that is travelled by 35,000 vehicles a day are major issues for our region and have been for years. The bridge recently had to undergo emergency repairs. \lineBreak What is the minister waiting for to protect the safety of the people in and around Quebec City? Is he waiting for another emergency closure?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. \lineBreak He is referring to an emergency closure that happened in the Montreal region, where the federal government did its homework. The Quebec government closed that part of the bridge. \lineBreak The Quebec Bridge is owned by a company called Canadian National. This case is currently before the courts so I must leave my comments at that."
346,"Mr. Speaker, after $50 million for border infrastructure was used for other purposes by the former industry minister, now internal auditors are pointing the finger at the Privy Council Office for having thousands of dollars in unauthorized expenses. \lineBreak What is the government, which claims to want to better manage public funds, doing? It is now eliminating the Public Works Canada internal audit service, which manages billions of dollars worth of government contracts. \lineBreak How can we have any hope that taxpayers' money will be well spent when the government is getting rid of a strong internal audit service at Public Works Canada?","Mr. Speaker, we have carefully examined spending and we have identified the programs that are least effective and less of a priority in order to save money. This process was carried out under the supervision of former national security advisor, Margaret Bloodworth, and former auditor general, Denis Desautels. "
347,"Mr. Speaker, through you to the  \lineBreak After the 2010 strategic review the government booked savings of $172 million in the Department of Public Works. We were told before the election by the then minister, Stockwell Day, President of the Treasury Board, that this would all be done through attrition. Now, after the election, we are told something completely different. We are told that the government is going to be firing auditors and that it will be letting people go in the hundreds. \lineBreak Why did the government deceive the people of Canada before the election?","Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada employs hundreds of thousands of people. When it is necessary to make adjustments to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are well spent, we always make sure, wherever possible, that we do that through attrition or reassignment. In this case, we are cutting expenditures that are not necessary. They are duplicative and will not affect the audit services of the Government of Canada."
348,"Mr. Speaker, employees are required for a business or government to function. The economy means jobs. Jobs mean consumers. No jobs mean no consumers and no economy. Yesterday, it was announced that 700 jobs would be eliminated at Public Works and Government Services Canada. These cutbacks are a severe blow to the regional economy. They will not help to control spending and will hinder the economic recovery; that much is clear. \lineBreak Such being the case, how can the government justify these savage layoffs?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave us a clear mandate to keep taxes low and to balance the budget by 2014-2015. We have taken a close look at spending and identified the least effective and lower priority programs in order to achieve the slated savings of approximately $98.6 million for Canadian taxpayers. "
349,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the government fired 92 auditors at Public Works, the same department responsible for stopping corruption and misspending. \lineBreak  The most essential role of the public service is to ensure that public money is spent according to the rules. When a government starts to fire the very people who are paid to verify, audit and control, the message is, “If you don't tell us what we want to hear, we'll fire you”. \lineBreak How can removing the controllers of public spending help control public spending?","Mr. Speaker, we have taken a close look at spending and identified those programs that are least effective and less of a priority. This will not have any impact on internal audit services. "

Why not lay the charge here, allow the Lebanese authorities to send him back to Canada, where he can clear his name and appear before a Canadian court with the protection of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? \lineBreak He is anxious to make full answer and defence to the charges against him. Why does the minister not do the right thing, charge him in Canada, as his lawyer asked today, have him come back here and let him clear his name in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, this government is very concerned about this case and Mr. Tepper's family in Canada during this difficult time. \lineBreak Consular officials in Lebanon have been actively providing consular assistance and support to Mr. Tepper and his family since his arrest, including regular visits to ensure his health and well-being. \lineBreak We will continue to engage with senior Lebanese authorities to request due process and a timely and transparent handling of these facts."

The two parties to this dispute have been unable to resolve the dispute over a significant period of time. Through their actions, they are imposing greater and greater costs on the wider Canadian public. That is not acceptable to the government, and we will act to protect the wider interests of Canadians."
352,"Mr. Speaker, the government is adding insult to injury. First it attacks workers, now it is disrespecting Quebeckers. The NDP proposed to the Conservatives that we respect Quebec's national holiday by not sitting that day. The Conservatives said no. It is not important to them. I urge the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, this legislative measure is in place to protect the greater interests of the Canadian economy, our society and the general public. It is up to the NDP.

354,"Mr. Speaker, blaming the provinces is no answer. This is a joint responsibility. There is no question that the current system is costly and inefficient. \lineBreak Our public health care system must move forward now to fit today's model of community care. We cannot wait until 2014. We need a long-term care strategy to free up hospital beds and support those with chronic health concerns. \lineBreak How long do we have to wait before the government takes meaningful action to address these critical shortages?","Mr. Speaker, our government has worked hard to protect and promote the health and safety of Canadians. In addition to our commitment to continue transfers of 6% to the provinces and territories, we made additional investments in pandemic preparedness, medical and neurological research, food and product safety, wait times, electronic health records, and aboriginal health. \lineBreak We have also passed the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, Cracking Down on Tobacco Marketing Aimed at Youth Act, and the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act. We continue to work with the provinces and territories."

"
358,"Mr. Speaker, these projects were recommended by the municipalities and supported by our government. They are public projects. All the money allocated was spent on these projects. The Auditor General made some recommendations, which the government accepted and will adopt in the future.","Mr. Speaker, with regard to the member for  \lineBreak Millions of dollars in expenses with no documentation and an RCMP investigation. Are we not getting a feeling of déjà vu here? "
359,"Mr. Speaker, there are so many mistakes in that preamble. The Auditor General has made some informed observations. We fully accept the advice of the Auditor General in the future. \lineBreak  Let us look at the five important points with respect to these initiatives: the money was spent on public infrastructure projects; every single penny was accounted for; every construction project was on time; costs came in under budget and, in fact, millions of dollars in this fund were not even spent; and all costs recorded were used for the purposes intended. \lineBreak In fact, there are 32 individual contribution agreements to support each one of these public infrastructure projects.","Mr. Speaker, when the member for "

Minister of Foreign Affairs.","Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest just a few short weeks ago to a wise man who made comments like this, “We are prepared to have a tone of debate and discussion that is respectful.

Why has my colleague from Timmins done such a terrible job in following the great example provided by the leader of the NDP?"
363,"Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more insulting to the debate of this House than to have a minister who is promoted after a scandal breaks. Not just promoted but promoted to the Treasury board, and who sits there day after day after day, hiding under his desk like Mini-Me. That is insulting to the people--","I am not sure how the hon. member expects to hear the answer to the question when his colleagues do not allow him to finish putting the question. He still has a few seconds left. If he wants to finish his question, then I will recognize the hon. minister.  \lineBreak I will go to the member for Timmins—James Bay for a very brief summary."
364,"Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, when will he do the right thing, stand up, and be responsible to this House and to the people of Canada?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite wants to talk about insults. I think there could be no greater insult than to break faith with the people who elected us and say one thing before the election and do another thing afterward, like this member did with the gun registry."
365,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians want the truth. A year and a half ago, this House voted for a public inquiry into Canada's transfer of detainees and significant risk of torture in Afghanistan.

366,"Mr. Speaker, almost two years have passed since the former Speaker of the House of Commons ordered the Conservatives to find some means of providing MPs with access to documents concerning allegations of torture of Afghan detainees, all the while bearing in mind national security issues. \lineBreak One year after a lame committee was established, it seems that the government is preparing to table a boatload of documents that, unfortunately, are not available in both official languages. \lineBreak How much time do they need to do the job properly?","Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we did. We put in place a process whereby their other colleagues in the opposition, the Bloc and the Liberals, examined thousands of documents over the months, but the NDP members did absolutely nothing. \lineBreak NDP members say they are concerned about Taliban prisoners, but let us face it, with friends like the NDP who needs enemies."
367,"Mr. Speaker, the law is very clear that spending government money is “subject to there being an appropriation for the particular service”. The Auditor General was very clear that there was no appropriation for the service of building G8 gazebos. The money was supposed to be for border infrastructure. \lineBreak If the government is so confident that it spent the money wisely, why does it not invite the Auditor General to do a value for money audit?","Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General, in releasing his report, said two things. He said there was no deliberate attempt to mislead Parliament. He also said that he did not know any law that had been broken. \lineBreak The Auditor General did make some observations, which the government fully accepts, on how we can be more transparent and clearer to Parliament. We fully accept those recommendations and will adopt them on future initiatives."
368,"Mr. Speaker, let us try again. \lineBreak During the G8 summit, $50 million that should have been used to reduce congestion at the borders was spent in the minister's riding. The Auditor General said that he had “not encountered” anything like that. This use of public funds is so controversial that the RCMP has decided to investigate. \lineBreak Will the government ask the Auditor General to conduct a value for money audit?","Mr. Speaker, the preamble to that question is in fact not true. That is not the case, the member's assertion and I would suspect she knows it is not true."

For that to happen quickly, it is essential that a ceasefire, even a temporary one, be called. \lineBreak What concrete action has this government taken to ensure that humanitarian aid is actually getting to the Libyan people? What aid has Canada given to Libyan civilians to date?","Mr. Speaker, this government has contributed to international humanitarian efforts in Libya. However, it is sometimes impossible to deliver this aid to certain areas of the country because Gadhafi's military is attacking the Libyan people. We urge the Libyan government to stop these attacks on its own people."

374,"Mr. Speaker, trade agreements can benefit a country when it negotiates a good agreement. However, this government has abandoned Canadians with its bad agreements. The cost of patented drugs in Canada is the fourth highest in the world. But the European agreement offers nothing to improve the quality of our health care. It only increases our drug costs. \lineBreak Will this government stand up for Canadians and work on improving the agreement?","Mr. Speaker, a trade agreement with the European Union would increase trade dramatically.

376,"Mr. Speaker, the point is, the government continues to negotiate flawed deals. The point is that the average price of patented medicines in Canada is already the fourth most expensive in the world. This deal does nothing but increase those costs. \lineBreak My question for the government is, will it stand up for Canadian families and work with the EU to fix this deal?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that question, but it is pretty rich for the New Democrats to now suggest that they are the great defenders of free trade.

It does not matter what the agreement is, they oppose it.  \lineBreak We are standing up for Canadians. Why will they not?"

382,"Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that the Conservative government is denying a region of young hockey players a place to play, and northern Cape Breton is just that region.  \lineBreak It is not that the people of the area have not stepped up to the plate with their share but because the Conservative government refuses to help them. The government was approached two years ago.  \lineBreak The Conservative government spent over $50 million for fake lakes, but it cannot help this community with an ice surface.

Killing the Wheat Board would be devastating for farmers and northerners in Churchill, along the bay line and across the north. So much for the government's commitment to the Arctic.  \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives abandoning farmers and northerners? Why do they not stand up for the people of the Prairies and save the Canadian Wheat Board and the port of Churchill?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote that member from yesterday in her own press conference, where she said:  \lineBreak Is that not a reason why farmers would use the port if they had the opportunity? \lineBreak We are going to continue to move ahead, giving western Canadian farmers the same freedoms that other farmers have across this country, the freedom to market their own products, the freedom to take advantage of the opportunities that they have."

385,"Mr. Speaker, it is alarming to discover that land attached to heritage lighthouses may be severed and sold off. Groups interested in preserving these structures see the land as integral to their plans.  \lineBreak The value of these lighthouses goes beyond the physical structures themselves, and the land is very much a part of these heritage sites. If we want to preserve and promote these sites, the land and lighthouses must remain unified. \lineBreak Will the government commit to protecting Canada's heritage sites and reverse its plans to sell off this land?","Mr. Speaker, we recognize the important role that lighthouses have played in our development as a nation.

The government has brought forward some modest and good reforms to the Senate of Canada. While I know this is not the position of the NDP, I would advise the NDP members to support these important reforms rather than aligning themselves with the forces of the status quo."

One in six acute-care beds are occupied by a patient needing home or long-term care.

The government, unlike the NDP, is not beholden to one of the parties at the table. The government represents the wider interest of the Canadian economy. This strike is bad for the economy and we will act. "
393,"Mr. Speaker, on the surface, the documents revealed by the Afghan detainee committee yesterday contain little new information.  \lineBreak After all this time and money, we are right back where we started. Torture and extrajudicial executions are not unusual in Afghan prisons, and Canada has handed prisoners over to these torturers.  \lineBreak Why does the government not do what is right and demand a public inquiry?","Mr. Speaker, our government is and has always been committed to handling Afghan Taliban prisoners in accordance with our international obligations. We have just been through a 12-month $12 million process where an unprecedented amount of information has been put before a number of parliamentarians of this place. It has been ruled upon by former members of the Supreme Court who have done an outstanding job for this country. \lineBreak  I think Canadians have a clear picture that our men and women in uniform fully accepted all our international obligations and have done a heck of a good job representing this country."
394,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak What the government spent $12 million on was trying to suppress the truth. Less than one-tenth of the documents were reviewed by the panel of ex-judges and less than half were even looked at by the back-room committee of MPs. For what?

It is increasingly damaging to a wide interest of the Canadian economy, small business, charities and ordinary working people. This is not acceptable and the government is acting to ensure that postal services resume for Canadians."
397,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's debt represents 34% of its income, but household debt represents approximately 150% of household income. \lineBreak The government is constantly talking about its own debt, but it is not helping Canadians deal with their debt. The best cure for this is a good job. \lineBreak When will the government create real jobs instead of part-time solutions and help Canadians get rid of their personal debt?","Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the job creation record of our government: nearly 560,000 net new jobs created since July 2009, of which more than 80% are full-time jobs. This is the best record of any country in the G7. Our country has been through a difficult time, a recession that came from outside our country, but we have managed our way through it and Canadians are doing well."
398,"Mr. Speaker, it is just not credible. The government talks about an economic recovery, but it has no plan to end the jobs crisis. That is not a recovery. We still have hundreds of thousands more unemployed than before the recession, a recession the government did not even see coming. \lineBreak Today, we learned that only 42% of the unemployed can access employment insurance, the insurance they paid into. \lineBreak Why is the government continuing to make working families pay for its failure to create jobs?","Mr. Speaker, Canada's economy has grown for seven straight quarters now since the recession ended in July 2009. I do not know where the member opposite gets her information, but not only have we recovered all of the jobs that were lost during the recession, we have also restored all of the economic output that was lost during the recession. Only one other country in the G7, that is Germany, has a comparable record."
399,"Mr. Speaker, this government's lack of compassion for people living in poverty is shocking. \lineBreak The Conservatives want to cut nearly half a billion dollars from the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, but they are refusing to say which programs will be affected. \lineBreak Canadians have a right to know. \lineBreak Which programs does this government intend to cut?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave us a clear, strong mandate. They want us to respect the money they make, the money we receive in taxes, and they want us to spend it very wisely. That is what we will do. We will eliminate waste."
400,"Mr. Speaker, that is simply not good enough. Twenty years after Parliament passed a New Democratic motion to end child poverty, Canadian children are still being left behind. \lineBreak Statistics released yesterday show that over 100,000 children in British Columbia are still living in poverty. That is 100,000 kids who are not getting a fair start in life. This is an urgent national problem. \lineBreak How can the government waste millions on gazebos and billions on tax giveaways to profitable corporations while leaving families to fend for themselves?","Mr. Speaker, our government really is reaching out to help families right across this country, especially those in need. That is one of the reasons that we introduced the universal child care benefit. We have increased the national child benefit as well. \lineBreak These are all initiatives aimed to help low income families get over the welfare wall, just like the WITB that we introduced and then increased. \lineBreak Sadly, the NDP voted against every one of those initiatives to help the most vulnerable families."
401,"Mr. Speaker, a pack of cigarettes very clearly warns us that tobacco causes cancer. Asbestos also causes cancer and yet this government refuses to put it on the Rotterdam Convention list of carcinogens. \lineBreak Nevertheless, other exporting countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam and Kazakhstan have done so. India, which imports our chrysotile, has done it.  \lineBreak Why is this government not doing the right thing?","Mr. Speaker, for over 30 years, the Canadian government has been promoting the safe and controlled use of chrysotile fibre, not asbestos in general as the hon. member mentioned, but chrysotile fibre. Recent scientific studies have shown that this fibre can be safely used in a controlled environment. This is the position that was taken by the previous government. "
402,"Mr. Speaker, the minister knows full well that it is very difficult to use chrysotile in the proper working conditions. The procedures, training, complex equipment are all needed to be able to use it in a safe way so that fibres are not accidentally breathed in. The minister knows this full well. He cannot assure us that it is not being used improperly in third world countries that import it. \lineBreak Why is the government deceiving Canadians and pretending that there is no problem? This is wilful blindness. The government is washing its hands of its responsibilities.","Mr. Speaker, we are talking here about risk management. We know that chrysotile fibre can be safely used in a controlled environment. I would like to remind the hon. member that the International Trade Union Movement for Chrysotile, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers, supports the safe use of chrysotile. These people know what they are doing. They are experts in the field and are supported in the safe use of chrysotile. Canada's position with regard to the convention therefore reflects the country's position."
403,"Mr. Speaker, according to its mission statement, Treasury Board Secretariat is supposed to ensure that “resources are soundly managed across government with a focus on results and value for money”. \lineBreak By that criteria, the first program that should be audited is the G8 legacy fund where $50 million which Parliament authorized for border infrastructure ended up in gazebos and washrooms that had nothing to do with the G8. \lineBreak Is the ","Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General looked at this initiative and made some helpful observations about how we could move forward in a more transparent and clear way in terms of the estimates presented to Parliament. The Auditor General also made some observations with respect to the administration of the program. \lineBreak The good news is every dollar is accounted for. All 32 projects came in on or under budget. In fact, the program itself was underspent by some $5 million."

405,"Mr. Speaker, I have a figure that is of interest to all of us. Had the President of the Treasury Board approved $50 million worth of projects in all of the country's other ridings, it would have cost the public treasury $15 billion. This gives some idea of the extent of the dubious spending that occurred in his riding.  \lineBreak But, above all, does the President of the Treasury Board understand that by favouring his friends, he is creating a two-tier democracy—one for his friends and one for other Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, let us look at what some of these infrastructure funds were spent on. \lineBreak They were spent on rehabilitating the airport in North Bay. They were spent on fixing up a provincial highway. They were spent on building a community centre that was used during the summit. These are all public infrastructure projects which add great value to the municipalities that recommended and submitted these projects."
406,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report shows how the member from Muskoka got away with giving out $50 million without any oversight. He deliberately froze out any accountable body. He blew off the checks and balances of Parliament. That is why we are having a police investigation.  \lineBreak Do the Conservatives really think it passes the smell test that three amigos-- the minister, a mayor and a hotel manager--were allowed to lord over 242 projects without any documentation? When will the minister stand up and produce the real paper trail?","Mr. Speaker, much of what the member opposite said is not true. It is not fact. The fact that he has to exaggerate suggests that the facts cannot present a powerful enough argument. \lineBreak The reality is there were three individuals who reviewed the submissions, but in fact they had no decision-making authority in this regard. \lineBreak The good news is that all 32 projects were completed on time. We did get some very helpful observations from the Auditor General. We thank her for her work and are fully accepting the good advice and counsel that she has provided."
407,"Mr. Speaker, they pilfered $50 million from border infrastructure and the police have been called in, but that is just a start. The member raided FedNor. He raided the community adjustment fund. He raided the stimulus fund. He created a $100 million personal legacy project that was blown on sunken boats and paving the bunny trail. \lineBreak Now the guy is in charge of Canada's treasury. Why are the Conservatives showing such contempt for Canadian taxpayers by putting him there?","Mr. Speaker, I have accepted the challenge of the  \lineBreak The reality is that the member for "

409,"Mr. Speaker, the government's record of deporting refugees to torture is troubling. The Benhmuda family, including two Canadian-born children, lived in Canada for eight years. The family was deported into the hands of Moammar Gadhafi and the father was tortured for six months. \lineBreak The family was able to escape to Malta. They are not safe there, and the UN has asked the government to repatriate them. \lineBreak Will the minister bring these Canadian children and the family back to Canada, where they belong?","First, Mr. Speaker, I have to take serious objection to the preamble of the hon. member's question. He knows full well that no Canadian government of any political stripe deports people to torture. We have the fairest asylum system in the world. Any one who our courts, our IRB or decision makers determines could face risk overseas is not returned to face risk. \lineBreak Having said that, this is a particularly complicated case. I cannot comment on the details because of the Privacy Act. If we receive an application from that family, I can assure the member it will be given every humanitarian consideration and dealt with on an accelerated basis."
410,"Mr. Speaker, 34 immigrant settlement agencies have lost their funding after $43 million was cut. It hits places like Toronto and Scarborough the hardest where 80,000 new Canadians are hurt by these service cuts. \lineBreak These cuts come at a time when Toronto schools are also cutting settlement staff, further eroding available services. Both the House and the immigration committee have voted to reverse these funding cuts, but Conservatives have ignored this. \lineBreak Why is the government putting up barriers to the integration of immigrants into Canadian society and our economy?","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his election, but not on his question, because every single assertion was false. \lineBreak In point of fact, this government has more than tripled the federal investment in integration and settlement services for newcomers. It was $200 million five years ago. It is now over $600 million. It has increased in Ontario. \lineBreak It is true that there are now more newcomers settling in places like Atlantic Canada and western Canada than in Ontario, and the dollars are following them, because we have a responsibility to make sure that all newcomers get an equal chance to succeed in Canada."
411,"Mr. Speaker, the minister's answer shows that he either does not get Toronto or he does not care. \lineBreak  When he cut this funding, not only did he abandon new Canadians, but he took decades of on the ground knowledge and tossed it out the window. In my riding of Davenport, the South Asian Women's Centre and the Davenport-Perth Neighbourhood Centre lost $1 million in funding, despite passing their official assessment. \lineBreak If these agencies are getting a passing grade, why is the government steamrolling ahead with cuts and ignoring immigrant families in Toronto?","Mr. Speaker, let me make this very simple for the NDP. \lineBreak  We have tripled the federal investment in settlement services for newcomers. There are hundreds of organizations that deliver those services on our behalf, but we receive applications from thousands of organizations. \lineBreak  I know the NDP believes that money grows on trees. I know the NDP thinks we can keep raising taxes to spend money without any limit. However, we cannot actually fund every one of the thousands of organizations that make an application. We have to make an assessment on their track record and on the quality of the applications and fund the best ones. That is exactly what we do, giving taxpayers value for the money."
412,"Mr. Speaker, on another topic, the question of the Senate, the  \lineBreak I wonder why the ","Mr. Speaker, of course, the election possibility raised in the legislation is an option for provinces. Some may choose to participate, some may not, but it is important in this day and age that we move forward with reform.  \lineBreak I know the Liberal Party will go to any lengths, including making completely false statements, to try to justify the status quo in the Senate of Canada and that is simply not acceptable to Canadians."
413,"Mr. Speaker, I will take the  \lineBreak The reality is that it is not the Liberal Party; it is the Province of Ontario, the Province of Quebec and the other provinces. It is also the former Alberta premier, who clearly shows that this proposal discriminates against his own province. \lineBreak The question remains. The Constitution protects the status of the Senate; not a party in the Parliament of Canada. \lineBreak What does the ","Mr. Speaker, it is perfectly clear that the changes proposed by this government fall under the constitutional authority of the Parliament of Canada, the federal Parliament.  \lineBreak It is very clear that the changes are within federal constitutional authority. I know that the Liberal Party, in both chambers, believes it is entitled to its entitlements, but we believe it is time to move forward with some reform."
414,"Mr. Speaker, I am very sad to say that floods and forest fires continue to devastate large segments of western Canada. Millions of acres of farmland have been flooded or have gone unseeded. Cattle producers may have to reduce their herds because of pasture damage and entire communities lay devastated. \lineBreak The western provinces cannot handle this alone. What will the government do to help western farmers, businesses and workers deal with the aftermath of these natural disasters?","Mr. Speaker, we are following, together with the provinces, with great interest the difficulties many are facing in the west due to these floods. Canadians can count on us to assist when disaster strikes. Because of this year's unprecedented floods, we have also offered to pay for half the costs of permanent mitigation measures constructed ahead of this year's floods that are not otherwise eligible for disaster financial assistance arrangements. We think it makes a lot of sense to put in place permanent mitigation measures to prevent damage like this from happening again, where possible."
415,"Mr. Speaker, what the provinces are saying is that they are looking for leadership and the government is not stepping up to the plate. \lineBreak Western premiers are calling for the federal government to have a national disaster mitigation plan and extra help for those whose livelihoods have been damaged. They see the need for federal help but the Conservatives seem content to stand idly by. \lineBreak Will the government listen to the premiers and develop a plan that includes a special compensation program for families and communities devastated by the floods and forest fires?","Mr. Speaker, I really must disagree with the hon. member. We have been quite impressed by the leadership the western premiers are taking in their jurisdictions where it is their primary responsibility to manage these affairs. We think they are doing a pretty good job. \lineBreak We are certainly willing to do our bit to assist with permanent mitigation measures arising out of this incident specifically, and to discuss a national mitigation plan in the long term. \lineBreak Again, we think it does make sense to put in place permanent measures to avoid problems from happening again when we have the opportunity to do that."
416,"Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, a holiday celebrated by all descendants of New France. I would like to take this opportunity to send greetings to all proud Franco-Ontarians, who, like myself, celebrate this day with love and dignity.  \lineBreak For our cousins in Quebec, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day is celebrated as a national holiday, a day off on which people get together with family and friends to celebrate the rich language of Rabelais and the French culture. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, since arriving on this continent over 400 years ago, we have been fighting to preserve our language, our culture and our values. One of our most cherished values is democracy. \lineBreak That is why I ask the Leader of the Opposition to let democracy prevail in the House, because by voting sooner rather than later, instead of sending good wishes for Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day from the House, we could return to our constituencies to celebrate Quebec, to celebrate our culture, to celebrate our nation and to celebrate French Canada."
417,"Mr. Speaker, for the second time in this young Parliament, I would like to ask the  \lineBreak After four years of study, that review was completed last October.

We are very proud of the investments that we have made."
419,"Mr. Speaker, a year ago, the then minister of transport said that the Windsor-Detroit border crossing could no longer wait, that it had to move forward. The minister acknowledged the importance of this infrastructure and also acknowledged that it was actually one of the most historic opportunities to build infrastructure for the prosperity of our country. \lineBreak However, now it hangs in the balance. It will cost thousands of jobs, affect the viability of our economy and put one of our most important trading partners at risk. \lineBreak I want to know why the ","Mr. Speaker, this is still a very important issue for us. We are working with our American partners on this issue and with MPs in the area. It is a very serious issue and we will manage it as such.

The freeze on trade relations with Libya is putting their scholarships and student visas in jeopardy.  \lineBreak Will this government extend the temporary exemption granted to Libyan students living in Canada, and will it ensure that they receive financial assistance immediately?","Mr. Speaker, Canada has acted quickly and decisively to approve an exemption from the sanctions so students would not suffer.  \lineBreak It is now time for the Libyan government to release the necessary funds to support the students and their families. We will continue to press Libya to provide the funding as soon as possible.  \lineBreak We will continue to work with these students to ensure they can complete their education in Canada."
424,"Mr. Speaker, this morning around 10:30, I happened to be in the foyer of the Centre Block and I saw a wonderful ceremony whereby three ministers of the government, surrounded by about 20 Conservative colleagues, were honouring our armed forces on behalf of Parliament and transferring a flag to, I believe, a chief warrant officer. There were a couple of other members of the armed forces as well. \lineBreak I am also a very proud member of the armed forces. The Liberal Party also believes in honouring our men and women. I would like to know why we were not notified and invited to this ceremony.","Unfortunately, question period is over. The hon. member had a chance to ask that question during question period. It is not a point of order. Perhaps it is a matter he can ask the minister."
425,"Mr. Speaker, this would normally be the end of the current session. As we know, the Parliament of Canada can do as it pleases. Last Thursday, we sat as though it were a Friday. Tomorrow, Friday, we will sit as though it were still Thursday. In fact, this could end up being the first-ever week of four Thursdays. \lineBreak The government has mastered the art of this type of transformation. It can turn losers into winners. If someone loses in an election and is not chosen to create legislation in the House, they can always be appointed to the Senate and sit as a parliamentarian. During question period, the Conservatives spoke about the importance of respecting the Quebec nation. Yet tomorrow is Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day and they still want us to sit. \lineBreak With all of these contradictions—in particular, the fact that they decided that the best way to monitor public spending is to fire those who monitor public spending and that they locked out workers and are now blaming the workers for not working—are there any more surprises like this in store for us this summer?","Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments from the member for  \lineBreak Since today is the last scheduled sitting of the House before members return to their constituencies for the summer, my answer will be relatively brief. \lineBreak When this bill is passed, the House will adjourn until September 19. \lineBreak As for the business of the House upon our return in September, I will advise my counterparts of the government's plans closer to that time. \lineBreak In case this is the last time I am on my feet this summer, let me thank the staff of the House and the clerks at the table for their support and their usual kind assistance, in addition to the pages, who I acknowledged fully yesterday. \lineBreak Finally, I thank all hon. members for the very productive sitting we have had this month.

428,"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister created a structural deficit by giving the gift of tax cuts to big business, and he has not changed course. Contrary to what he says, these companies are not investing and are not creating jobs. A full $500 billion is sitting in corporate coffers and could be used to create jobs. The Conservative strategy does not work. \lineBreak Where are the investments? Where are the jobs?","Mr. Speaker, more Canadians are working now than before the global recession. Canada is practically the only industrialized country to have achieved this, and that is because of our commitment to keeping taxes low, not only for companies, but also for individuals and families. This government clearly understands that raising taxes does not create jobs."
429,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Instead of wasting money on gifts for large corporations, when will the government introduce a job creation program?","Mr. Speaker, I certainly deal with my colleagues in the G7 regularly. We have a serious situation in Europe and some weakness in the U.S. economy. \lineBreak However, the plain fact is that we are the envy of the advanced economies in the world with respect to job creation. We have created almost 600,000 net new jobs since the recession ended. More than that, 80% of those jobs are full-time jobs for Canadians. Our job record is second to none."
430,"Mr. Speaker, what the Conservatives have created is the largest deficit in Canadian history and they have still fallen short on job creation. Their strategy of something for nothing corporate tax giveaways has failed Canadians. Another 420,000 jobs would need to be created just to keep the same proportion of jobs we had before the 2008 recession. \lineBreak Why will the ","Mr. Speaker, I do not know who the member opposite thinks the real job creators are other than small businesses in Canada that pay taxes.

It is the small businesses, which is why we have a hiring credit for small business in the budget this year. I hope the member will support the budget. \lineBreak Our record with respect to job creation is among the best in the developed economies. We realize that our unemployment rate is still too high and that we need to keep working at it, but the way to get there is not to have a $10 billion tax increase on business, which is what the opposition has suggested."
431,"Mr. Speaker, through all the rhetoric, a few facts emerge which I think Canadians will all understand. The first fact is that 1.4 million people are officially unemployed and there are many hundreds of thousands of others who have been discouraged from working.  \lineBreak The second fact is that the economy contracted in the last quarter and the economy right now clearly is not growing. Those are undeniable facts. \lineBreak Last year, the government produced an economic statement on October 12.

Its priority is to create jobs and growth.  \lineBreak Obviously, we have a fundamental difference here with the opposition of all stripes. We understand that jobs cannot be created by raising taxes. We will keep taxes low in this country as part of our job creation strategy."

As I have repeated many times, the global economy, the global recovery, remains very fragile. Of course this means that Canada does face some serious risks and this government will act appropriately at all times. Once again, we cannot create jobs with the kind of debt that exists in other countries, in Europe and the United States. These debts are one of the major problems causing the global recession. We do not want to have such policies here. "

Canadians spoke out against this type of politics and these types of attacks in the last election. They voted for a government that would make job creation and economic growth a priority and that is exactly what this government is doing."
435,"Mr. Speaker, when the Auditor General tried to investigate the $50 million in pork barrel spending in Muskoka, she was unable to find a paper trail because she was not told that the projects were run through the member's constituency office and was not told that senior bureaucrats participated. It was NDP researchers, with the help of honest municipal councillors in Muskoka, who broke the code of silence.  \lineBreak  Who directed these bureaucrats to keep silent and who told them to show such disrespect for the Canadian taxpayer?","Mr. Speaker, there is nothing new here. What I can say is that 32 projects were funded by Infrastructure Canada. There were 32 different contribution agreements for each project. All of these projects were finished on time and on budget and every dollar was accounted for.  \lineBreak We appreciated the good advice we received from the Auditor General on ways we could be even more transparent and do things better."
436,"Mr. Speaker, we know that some deputy ministers provided inaccurate statements to the Auditor General. \lineBreak The Foreign Affairs summit management office said it was not involved in examining project funding and yet we have learned today that this is not true.

There is nothing new here whatsoever.  \lineBreak The Auditor General came forward with her report, and we thank her for her work. She came forward with specific recommendations on how we could be even more transparent to Parliament, specific recommendations on improving program administration. The good news is that 32 public infrastructure projects were all constructed. They all came in on or under budget and they are all public infrastructure benefits that will benefit the people of that region for many years to come."
438,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General was kept in the dark about the minister's homemade funding process. Deputy ministers signed off on inaccurate statements. The summit management office was misleading about its involvement with funding meetings and the minister went ahead with these slush fund meetings,  in the middle of an election campaign. Allocating funding out of the backrooms of constituency offices is not ethical government. \lineBreak Will the minister finally apologize to Canadians for this abuse of their trust?","Mr. Speaker, I only have 35 seconds and I could not possibly go through every inaccuracy in the member's question. \lineBreak  There were 32 different contribution agreements all signed to support 32 infrastructure projects.

In the case of some ministers, travel by private jet has increased by 50%. We would prefer to see such an increase in the use of public transportation. \lineBreak Can the government come up with a better excuse to justify this use than saying that the Liberals did worse?","Mr. Speaker, there they go making things up. The reality is that the jets are used for government business. They are used when commercial flights are not available. We have reduced the amount of time in which the jets are being used. They are used for another very important purpose, which is for medevacs for the Canadian Forces. These were aircraft that were purchased in the 1980s.

Most of the time, this MP's party voted against it, so it is very interesting to hear this now."
444,"Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the government is cutting infrastructure spending. \lineBreak The government has to stop shirking its responsibilities and start taking the necessary measures to help the greater Montreal area. Modernizing Montreal's infrastructure cannot wait. The city's economic future depends on it.  \lineBreak Will the government take this opportunity to promote sustainable development, carpooling and public transit?","Mr. Speaker, something that is very important to our government is respecting jurisdictions. My colleague should know that in Quebec, every decision to invest in infrastructure is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec, except for when it comes to the three bridges that are owned by the federal government. We will talk about that again later I am sure. \lineBreak When the time comes to invest in Quebec's infrastructure, we will do so by respecting municipal priorities and the provincial government, as we do in every province in the country. And we will continue to do so."
445,"Mr. Speaker, the government needs to prove that the economy is indeed its priority. The infrastructure problems in the greater Montreal area are having a major economic impact. The Champlain Bridge has reached the end of its life. Yet the government is looking for excuses not to replace it. \lineBreak Will the government do its duty and protect the city's economy? This is a national issue. Will the government announce the construction of a new bridge immediately?","Mr. Speaker, since 2009, we have invested $379 million in Montreal bridges, mainly in the Champlain Bridge, to ensure the smooth flow of traffic and further enhance the safety of this infrastructure. The majority of the party opposite voted against this. It is interesting to hear what they have to say today. "
446,"Mr. Speaker, we now know that, from 2008 to 2011, the people who were using the Mercier Bridge were in real danger even before the bridge closed this summer. This is not only an economic issue but also one of public safety. It is irresponsible to play with the safety of motorists, truckers and public transit users. \lineBreak Will the government do the right thing today so that people can travel safely?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify. A total of $135 million has been invested in the federal part of the Mercier Bridge. Work that had been planned for several years was completed this summer. The Government of Quebec is continuing to do its work. The comments today pertain to the provincial part of the Mercier Bridge. We will continue to ensure that federal bridges in the Montreal area are in good condition and meet the needs of the population."
447,"Mr. Speaker, my question relates to the serious and ongoing issue of anti-Semitism in the international community. \lineBreak The Conservative government has been a global leader in combating anti-Semitism. It has, for example, been the first government anywhere in the world to announce that it would not participate in the commemoration of the Durban declaration. \lineBreak My question to the ","Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank that member, as well as the member for  \lineBreak I am pleased to announce that this evening the  \lineBreak We stand in solidarity with the Jewish people and their democratic state."
448,"Mr. Speaker, there is no business case for abolishing the Canadian Wheat Board. It is an ideological crusade, plain and simple. \lineBreak Now a clear majority of Canadian grain producers have voted to keep the single desk monopoly of the Wheat Board. \lineBreak I argue that the minister is both duty bound and honour bound to uphold the democratic will of prairie grain producers and to respect the very act that defines his ministry, which guarantees a vote of prairie producers before the government interferes with their ability to market their grain.","Mr. Speaker, the plebiscite that the Wheat Board undertook left out a glaring hole in the middle: the right for farmers to voluntarily choose where they should market their grain. \lineBreak That is a right that we have campaigned on. May 2 saw a result, giving us the authority to move forward on that.  \lineBreak We certainly intend to do that and to give those farmers the right and the opportunity to market their commodities at a time, place and price that they see fit, the same as their cousins in Ontario."
449,"Mr. Speaker, our American neighbours certainly see the benefit in the Canadian Wheat Board to Canadian farmers, because 13 times they have gone to the WTO and trade tribunals to complain that it is an unfair competitive advantage. \lineBreak Now our  \lineBreak My question is simple: what side is the minister on? Why is he standing up for the American agrifood giants and not standing up for Canadian grain producers, who benefit from the Canadian Wheat Board?","Mr. Speaker, let me quote one of the farmers from western Canada: \lineBreak That is the crux of this. We saw the Australian model opening up their wheat board some three years ago. When I met with the Minister of Trade from Australia at the Cairns Group last week, he said that the only mistake they made was not doing it sooner. \lineBreak We look to that model. It has been very positive for the farmers in Australia. We know the farmers in western Canada will follow that same model and have a much better chance of prosperity."
450,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Recent events have become a distraction. There are unanswered questions about the parliamentary secretary's judgment and potential security concerns. \lineBreak My question is, will the parliamentary secretary step aside from his responsibilities until the situation is investigated?","Mr. Speaker, the member for "
451,"Mr. Speaker, foreign affairs must be taken much more seriously. While the  \lineBreak Could the opposition have a copy of the report that was produced?","Mr. Speaker, I am not entirely sure what this has to do with government business and I do not know what inquiries into people's personal lives have to do with the new tone of decorum. \lineBreak The member for "
452,"Mr. Speaker, with his hand on his heart, the  \lineBreak Why has the government written off Quebec? Is it because Quebeckers did not vote the right way, or is it the influence of the ","Mr. Speaker, I think that question should go back to the member for "
453,"Mr. Speaker, on September 16, the union representing Air Canada flight attendants served 72 hours' notice to strike, a strike that could take place at 12:01 Wednesday morning. \lineBreak Because Air Canada plays such a vital role in the Canadian economy, could the ","Mr. Speaker, in cases like this the best solution is always the one that parties reach themselves. To that effect, both officials and I have been engaged with the parties. \lineBreak  We have received strike notice, as the member said,  and we are very concerned that a disruption of the air service will damage Canada's economic recovery. Canadians gave our government a very strong mandate with respect to the economic recovery, and they want us to focus on the economy. That is why, if there is a work stoppage, we will act to protect Canada's economy."
454,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives intend to cut 120 Service Canada processing centres down to 22 over the next three years. The government's plan to shift jobs out of rural areas with high unemployment into urban centres makes no sense. Canada's economy remains fragile, while the government remains illogical. The Service Canada cuts will result in the loss of well-paying jobs in rural Canada, jobs we cannot afford to lose. \lineBreak At a time when Canadians need their government most, why does the government continue to cut, cut, cut instead of focusing on jobs, jobs, jobs?","Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of aspects to that. During the global recession, the number of applications for employment insurance really spiked. To ensure Canadians got their EI payments in a timely manner, we hired additional temporary workers. Those workers knew that the jobs were temporary and so did their unions. \lineBreak  The good news is that thanks to our economic action plan, we are leading the world in job creation. There are not as many applications for EI,  so we do not need those temporary workers anymore. \lineBreak Therefore, we are honouring our commitment to taxpayers to use their dollars wisely."
455,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians have learned about these cuts to Service Canada,  and we know that these jobs are very important in terms of speeding up the processing of employment insurance claims. We know there continues to be a backlog in many areas around Canada. \lineBreak  Therefore, will the minister explain to out-of-work Canadians why the Conservatives are making it harder to access a program that Canadians have paid into?","Mr. Speaker, we want to ensure that Canadians do access the services to which they are entitled in an effective and efficient manner. We have a mandate from the Canadian people to ensure we provide our services efficiently. Up until now, it has been mostly done by paper. Therefore, we are trying to take a giant leap forward into the 21st century and we are automating a lot of this because it is a more responsive and responsible way to deal with things. \lineBreak  No Service Canada in-person services are being cut through this program because we want to ensure we are responsive to Canadians so they get their payments quickly, accurately and in a responsible way regarding their taxpayer dollars."
456,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians from coast to coast were horrified when Kienan Hebert was abducted from his home in Sparwood in my riding of  \lineBreak Our government is committed to keeping our streets and communities safe and to protecting our must vulnerable. Would the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for  \lineBreak We have taken concrete steps to protect Canada's most vulnerable. We have raised the age of consent from 14 to 16, strengthening sentencing provisions for dangerous offenders. We believe those who commit violent crimes should serve sentences which reflect the severity of their crimes.  \lineBreak I am proud to be part of a government that puts victims first. Canadians know they can count on this government."
457,"Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, the Governments of Canada, Ontario and Toronto jointly created and funded the agency Waterfront Toronto for the purpose, in part, of developing Toronto's Port Lands in a socially and environmentally responsible way.  \lineBreak Waterfront Toronto's plan is ready for implementation after rigorous consultation with the citizens of the city. Now the mayor of Toronto is seeking to take control of the agency and implement his own plan. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, not only can I confirm the commitment of the federal government, in fact, the commitment was $500 million and about $492 million of that money has been spent. In fact, most of the projects that have gone ahead, including Mimico Park, Canada's Sugar Beach and the Sherbourne Park, were done primarily with federal money on the Toronto waterfront. Therefore, we have supported the Waterfront Toronto project throughout its time of advancing. \lineBreak  I understand that the mayor of Toronto and Waterfront Toronto are having some discussions and I expect that they will come to an amicable resolution."
458,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, each Canadian vote, to the greatest extent possible, should carry equal weight. We will be taking reasonable and measured action to restore fair representation in the House of Commons, including protecting Quebec's constitutionally-enshrined representation. \lineBreak Unlike the opposition, we are governing for all Canadians and we will pursue what is fair and principled."
459,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians do not understand how money allocated by Parliament to improve border infrastructure could have been used to build gazebos and washrooms that had nothing to do with the G8 summit. Even the Auditor General agrees that this matter is very troubling. \lineBreak Since the Conservatives like to boast about accountability and claim to have nothing to hide, will they allow the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates to review how the funds were allocated? ","Mr. Speaker, in fact we have done more than that. We have had a review of this issue by the Auditor General. She came forward and made several recommendations on how we can be even more transparent to Parliament. We have accepted all those recommendations. \lineBreak I would say to the member opposite that this is the same old type of tactic that Canadians rejected in the last election. Canadians want their parliamentarians and their government to be focused on jobs, economic growth and economic opportunity. That is exactly what this government will continue to focus on."
460,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure the  \lineBreak A total of $20 million was granted to a private company to study the cuts to public services. That is $90,000 a day being wasted! The  \lineBreak Why is the government paying contractors top dollar to do its dirty work?","Mr. Speaker, since the end of the recession, 600,000 jobs have been created here in Canada. Canadians gave us a strong mandate to protect and pursue Canada's economic recovery. While the opposition is calling for tax increases that would result in the loss of jobs and harm the economy, the government has a plan to keep taxes low and focus on job creation for Canadians and economic growth. \lineBreak We know that irresponsible spending and out-of-control debt are the main problems other countries are facing today. That is why the demands of the opposition will not be met."
461,"Mr. Speaker, once again, I am going to have to respond to the spokesperson for the  \lineBreak When the public interest is not consistent with their ideology, they forget about the public interest. Can the ","Mr. Speaker, that is completely false, and Treasury Board's involvement with the private sector is an integral part of our plan to ensure that Canada avoids the economic and financial problems that have heavily hit many of the other countries in the world. Once again, fortunately, 600,000 new jobs have been created since the end of the recession, thanks to the good work of the world's best "
462,"Mr. Speaker, if cuts are made to Canada's ozone monitoring network, we will lose a third of the world's resources to monitor the growing hole in the ozone layer. \lineBreak This network has been collecting research data for 45 years. It is a key player in international efforts to protect the ozone layer.  \lineBreak How will this government explain to other countries that Canada is withdrawing from an important monitoring mechanism that is provided for in the Montreal Protocol?","Mr. Speaker, as my colleague is aware, since we took power, Canada has created nearly 600,000 net new jobs. \lineBreak I must say that while "
463,"Mr. Speaker, the minister says he is not cutting jobs with ozone-related research and yesterday he told the House that cuts to Environment Canada will only affect “surplus” workers. It is hard to imagine where he is finding surplus when key programs like ozone monitoring are now often run by only one person. \lineBreak  Before we take his word on what a “surplus” worker is, will the minister tell the House what analysis his department has done that shows the actual impacts of these cuts?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know how I can be much more clear. I have said we are not closing any of our ozone-monitoring services or closing the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre. \lineBreak As we are doing across government, we at Environment Canada will be taking a close look at all of our spending through the next year, and the results of our deficit reduction action plan will be revealed in next year's budget."
464,"Mr. Speaker, despite ongoing talks at Air Canada, the minister has leapt into the fray and indicated she would order flight attendants back to work, giving an unmistakable preference to management negotiators. \lineBreak Clearly, the government is ready to use this opportunity to again undermine employee pension security, just as it did earlier this year. Pension security must be part of any plan to stimulate this economy. \lineBreak Why is the government so eager to compromise the pension security of over 6,800 Air Canada workers?","Mr. Speaker, our labour minister has been front and centre in ensuring that whatever happens, the parties involved in this discussion continue their discussions. The pensions seem to be at the middle of it. We hope they can settle. However, it is very important that we ensure the economy is not negatively impacted. The pensions will be dealt with in due time."
465,"Mr. Speaker, whether it is the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto or Montreal's Champlain Bridge, Canada's major infrastructure is crumbling, leaving too many Canadians with a white-knuckle drive to work. \lineBreak At the same time, the IMF said today it predicts Canada's unemployment rate is going to rise above 7.5%. \lineBreak Infrastructure means jobs. Is it not time for the government to move Canada forward and invest in job creation and public safety?","Mr. Speaker, no government in history has invested more in Canada's infrastructure than our present government. In budget 2011 we continued to build on our unprecedented commitment by making the annual $2 billion gas tax fund permanent. It is very important for municipalities, and I think the opposition voted against it."
466,"Mr. Speaker, Torontonians are about to lose a thousand jobs in the public transit system. That means longer waits for buses and trains, and fare increases. Meanwhile, in Calgary trains are literally breaking down. Commuters across Canada are stuck in traffic jams. The mayor of Calgary, who happens to be in town this week, has long called for a federal transit strategy. \lineBreak Could the minister explain why Canada is the only OECD or G7 country without a national transit plan or strategy?","Mr. Speaker, we have to respect our partners. Municipalities and provinces are responsible for transit issues and we respect that. We do not have to tell Toronto's city councillors how to manage the transit in their own city. We have to respect them. We are there to support them with the money of the population of Canada in Toronto. That is what we will continue to do."
467,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  \lineBreak When will we see a sustainable solution for motorists, public transportation users and truck drivers?","Mr. Speaker, if public transportation is a priority for the official opposition, I would like my colleague to explain why the NDP voted against the Toronto Rocket project, against the Métrobus 803 project in Quebec City, against the Evergreen Line project in Vancouver and against a number of other projects. We will continue to do the work, to do what is necessary for public transportation and to ensure that all federal infrastructures are kept in good working order, while respecting provincial jurisdictions."
468,"Mr. Speaker, the minister does not seem to understand the scope of the problem: a highway is collapsing, a bridge is urgently shut down. It is clear that this government simply does not have an infrastructure modernization plan that is focused on job creation. Patching up a bridge that is at the end of its useful life is not a sustainable strategy nor is it a safe one. \lineBreak When will the minister understand that if he wants to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, a new bridge is needed?","Mr. Speaker, if we were to have a new bridge or other infrastructure, it would take seven to ten years to complete. How does my colleague think that new infrastructure would resolve Montreal's traffic problems today? That is unbelievable. We must ensure that the infrastructure in place now is still able to endure the load of existing traffic for a number of years and that all of the options are considered regarding future infrastructure."
469,"Mr. Speaker, the situation in Libya this past summer has seen the toppling of the Gadhafi regime and the emergence of a real democratic hope. However, despite these gains we recognize that the situation does remain unstable. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, today the  \lineBreak Canada stands ready to support the new Libyan government through the UN coordinated efforts committed to helping the people of Libya."
470,"Mr. Speaker, the people of B.C. have spoken loud and clear. In a historic referendum they rejected the HST tax grab that the  \lineBreak Forcing them to pay back over a billion dollars is a spiteful reaction to the province's fair and democratic decision. When will the government agree to respect voters and treat B.C. voters fairly?","Mr. Speaker, as I am sure the member opposite knows, there is an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of British Columbia. \lineBreak HST is a provincial responsibility. I met yesterday with the Minister of Finance of British Columbia. He reported to me, of course, the results of the referendum there. We are now working on the exit strategy since this is a provincial responsibility and the provincial government will not be continuing with the HST."
471,"Mr. Speaker, this money has already been invested in health care, education and other family priorities. Forcing the province to pay it back will hurt very important services and create a hole in the province's budget. \lineBreak  The government needs to do the right thing, the fair thing. Will the government drop its plan to punish British Columbians for rejecting its HST?","Mr. Speaker, the HST is a provincial responsibility. There is an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of British Columbia. The agreement has provisions with respect to repayment of the sum that was advanced by the Government of Canada. That sum was advanced as part of the agreement to proceed with the HST. The province is not proceeding with that now. It follows that honouring the agreement will require repayment."
472,"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about honouring and keeping promises. In the Conservative Party platform unveiled on April 8 and in numerous statements made by the  \lineBreak In a joint press release issued on September 14, the finance ministers from Quebec and Canada had to admit that the promise would not be kept. What is the problem?","Mr. Speaker, we have had a lengthy series of discussions with the Government of Quebec with respect to the HST and those discussions have continued. \lineBreak The Minister of Finance of Quebec and I agreed a week or so ago that we would continue the discussions toward the end of September. I am hopeful and relatively confidence that we will arrive at an agreement."

We need to agree on the terms with respect to the HST, and then the payment would flow after that. This is entirely normal. It is the procedure we are following. There is goodwill on both sides. We will carry on with the discussions with the goal of reaching an agreement by the end of September."
474,"Mr. Speaker, for the third time, I have a question for the  \lineBreak Will that legislation be introduced and enacted in this calendar year? For the third time, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, in March of this year, our government announced a comprehensive strategy that responds to the findings of the review. \lineBreak Our government is following up on its commitment to improve the performance of the rail-based supply chain. We will soon be naming the facilitator and the review process will be officially launched."
475,"Mr. Speaker, with Canada close to another recession, one would think the government would have better things to do than tamper with the rights of working people, but that is just what it is doing. \lineBreak Air Canada says that it is close to a deal. The union says that it is close to a deal. Both sides know it is better for business if a collective agreement is reached around the bargaining table. \lineBreak If the government is so worried about the economy, why will it not leave Canadian workers alone and start focusing on the economy?","Mr. Speaker, exactly what we are doing is focusing on the economy, as the hon. member pointed out. We introduced the notice of our intention for back to work legislation if the two parties are unable to reach a deal, as the member pointed out. I am very optimistic that they are close to a deal and I hope that I will have something more to say later on today."
476,"Mr. Speaker, employees have the right to negotiate their collective agreement. They have the right to use pressure tactics. It is called a right for a reason. Threatening workers with special legislation takes their rights away. The economy is not just big business profits; it is also workers' salaries and pensions. \lineBreak Will the minister stop interfering in the Air Canada negotiations and, instead, encourage the parties to negotiate an agreement that will be acceptable to them both?","Mr. Speaker, it is very true that the best deal the parties can get is one that they conclude themselves, which is why our officials are still at the table sincerely trying to help the two parties find their way to a deal or to a process to a deal.  \lineBreak The reason that we introduced the notice of back to work legislation yesterday was to protect the economy and to protect the Canadian travelling public, of which 65,000 people could be stranded on the first day of a strike. \lineBreak We are always considering the needs of the Canadian economy but, most important, the Canadian public as well."
477,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Walk 4 Justice concluded its cross-country journey to raise awareness of the hundreds of aboriginal mothers, aunties, daughters and sisters who are missing or have been murdered. \lineBreak The government has failed to provide justice for the victims, healing for the families or an end to the violence.  \lineBreak If the government wants to be tough on crime, then it should call a public inquiry. If it wants to prevent violence against women, then it should call a public inquiry.  \lineBreak How many more aboriginal women need to die before the government takes this issue as the serious crisis that it is?","Mr. Speaker, we take this issue very seriously. The fact is that no government in the history of this country has stood up for the rights of victims more than this government.  \lineBreak When it comes to aboriginal women in particular, we have been working with law enforcement agencies across the country. As the member knows, the RCMP now has a new Centre for Missing Persons. Law enforcement databases have been updated to investigate missing and murdered aboriginal women specifically. We are also boosting victims' services across the country, particularly in aboriginal communities."
478,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Wheat Board is the largest and most successful grain marketing company in the world. We do not dismantle a $6 billion a year corporation without significant closing costs that KPMG has actually set at $500 million. \lineBreak In this era of high deficits, how can the Conservatives defend borrowing $500 million they do not have just to indulge the foolish free market flight of fancy of a feckless ","Mr. Speaker, getting past  the political hackery, the reality is that Canadians gave us a strong mandate on May 2. We continue to move forward on an issue on which we campaigned long and hard in some six elections in which I have been involved. \lineBreak  However, I will quote someone who said, “When the government is intending to change legislation, I honestly do not see the grounds for going to court. The government has the right to change legislation”.  \lineBreak Do members know who said that? It was the member for "
479,"Mr. Speaker, last week, the U.S. administration proposed the inclusion of buy American provisions as part of their draft infrastructure funding proposal. \lineBreak Our government moved quickly on the matter, raising concerns with the American administration to defend Canadian workers and businesses. \lineBreak This is what the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses had to say: \lineBreak Would the hard-working ","Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for  \lineBreak I have raised our concerns regarding the draft buy American provisions with Ambassador Jacobson, as well as with Ambassador Kirk, and we have triggered formal consultations on the matter. I reminded the ambassadors that, if enacted, the proposed restrictions would send a negative signal to governments around the world that trade restrictions are an acceptable policy choice. They are not. \lineBreak Our government will continue to advocate opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses alike through free and open trade."
480,"Mr. Speaker, we have communicated repeatedly with the  \lineBreak What measures does the minister plan to take regarding the illegal commercial flights that are causing noise pollution and threatening the safety of my constituents? ","Mr. Speaker, such situations come under the authority of local officials. People in the community set up anti-noise committees and committees to improve the quality of life and the environment. It is up to the local people to reach an agreement amongst themselves. Various points of view have been put forward, but from a Transport Canada perspective, no rules have been broken. It is up to the people of the community to come up with solutions. Transport Canada officials have already attended meetings. There are many mayors and many Canadian municipalities, and we could not possibly speak to each of them whenever they like."
481,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report on the G8 legacy fund said that no public servants were involved. We now know that is wrong. Employees of FedNor were involved. Clearly, somebody misled the Auditor General. \lineBreak  I have a motion at the government operations committee this afternoon calling for an investigation into this matter. \lineBreak Will the government, which rode into power on the white horse of accountability, support my motion, or does it think now that it has a majority, accountability no longer matters?","Mr. Speaker, again the facts have not changed. This issue was thoroughly heard. The Auditor General had all the government information.  \lineBreak However, let me give members more good news on this. \lineBreak  Rehabilitating the airport in North Bay, fixing up the provincial highway and building a community centre that was used during the summit are all public infrastructure projects that added great value to the municipalities and were recommended by the municipalities themselves. "
482,"Mr. Speaker, with the omnibus bill they introduced today, the Conservatives are clearly trying to impose their regressive and ideological vision of justice. They want to put more young people in prison, deny offenders who have redeemed themselves the pardon they deserve, prevent the justice system from imposing conditional sentences that would allow for rehabilitation, and fill Quebec's prisons. \lineBreak How can the minister justify not only imposing values on Quebeckers that are not their own, but also sticking them with the bill to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars?","Mr. Speaker, our government's mandate from Canadians is to keep our streets and communities safe by moving quickly to reintroduce comprehensive law and order legislation. \lineBreak The government is taking action to protect families, stand up for victims and hold criminals accountable. \lineBreak I would ask that the member really reconsider whether she thinks that those who sexually abuse children should in fact be entitled to a pardon. Our government believes that is inappropriate. They are a danger to children, and she should be protecting children."
483,"Mr. Speaker, there have been consultations and I believe if you seek it, you would find unanimous consent to revert to presenting reports from committees.",Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent to revert to presenting reports from committees?
484,"Mr. Speaker, the buy American provisions and the United States country of origin labelling provisions have been found by the WTO to discriminate against Canadian livestock exports. \lineBreak Without question, this protectionist action has cost the Canadian livestock industry billions of dollars. \lineBreak Just when will the government stand up for Canadians against U.S. protectionism? Is the minister now prepared to serve notice to the U.S. and demand compensation for Canada's livestock industry?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the member for  \lineBreak That panel has released an interim report that was very favourable to Canada. The Americans are now negotiating with us in good faith on a way forward. We are hopeful that we can settle this very quickly and continue to move on. \lineBreak I hope the member stays awake for the good result we will have."
485,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to respectfully ask the ","Mr. Speaker, a joint press release was issued by the Province of Quebec and the Government of Canada. This shows that we have been negotiating on this issue in good faith from the outset. Things are moving forward and are going well, as the finance ministers for both Quebec and Canada have said. It is time to stop nitpicking and look at the result. It is on the way. \lineBreak Those members over there were in power for 13 years and always said that the sales tax could not be harmonized. We get things done, and we will keep our promise."
486,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak This week's dismal report of the Canadian economy by the IMF should be a wake-up call. How can the Conservatives pretend the IMF report was good news? How can they brag about doing well when between 1.5 and 2 million Canadians are out of work?","Because it is true, Mr. Speaker. Canada is doing relatively well. That is what the IMF said yesterday.  \lineBreak We have the best fiscal position in the G7. We have the lowest total government net debt to GDP ratio in the G7. We have the best growth in the G7. We have the best banking system in the world. Canada is the best place to invest and do business in the next five years according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. We have the best job creation in the G7 since the recession.  \lineBreak All of this is true, and that is why we are doing relatively well."
487,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' policies have widened the gap between the rich and the middle class. The poverty level is rising. The unemployment rate is rising. The minister can play with the numbers, but the truth is that in order for Canada to achieve the same level of employment that we had before the recession in 2008, we need 420,000 more jobs. That is the reality. \lineBreak Why is the minister pleased to see that 2 million Canadians are out of work? ","Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we had and still have a very successful economic action plan. A total of 600,000 net new jobs have been created in Canada since the recession began. We are still in the process of implementing our budget, including an upcoming hiring credit for SMEs. As my colleague the "
488,"Mr. Speaker, the minister needs to open his eyes. \lineBreak Scotiabank is saying that we are on the verge of a recession. Moody's is saying that households are carrying too much debt. The IMF revised Canada's economic outlook downward. It is not the NDP that is saying these things. It is his friends. Inflation is way up, which will hurt the poor and the middle class and slow the economy down even further. \lineBreak Is the minister aware of this?","Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. What is this report saying? It is saying that over the next two years, we will have the best economic growth in the G7 and will be the best place to invest. That says something for all the jobs that were created here. On the other hand, the NDP is proposing plans to increase taxes by $10 billion a year. That would kill the economy. It would be an economic fiasco. That is not what we are going to do. "
489,"Mr. Speaker, job creation is not the same thing as growth in the labour force. It is far from encouraging for the families of the two million Canadians who are unemployed, underemployed or downright discouraged. The rising price of gas and groceries is putting additional pressure on Canadian families' budgets. \lineBreak The Conservatives are very generous with the oil companies, but why are they not doing more for Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, let me deal with the facts. The oil companies pay the same taxes as other Canadian businesses pay. It is high time that suggestions to the contrary are stopped, because they are not accurate.  \lineBreak  I know the member opposite wants to try to be accurate when she talks about tax matters in Canada and accurate, of course, about the NDP plan that that party advanced to the people of Canada in the last election to raise taxes by about $10 billion per year on businesses, which we all know will be passed along to individuals as part of the cost of doing business. That proposal by the NDP is inflationary for Canadian families."
490,"Mr. Speaker, we all agree that the best antidote to household debt is a good job. Unfortunately, the Conservatives are doing almost nothing for the two million Canadians who need one. \lineBreak The government persists with its generous tax breaks for highly profitable oil companies, and yet takes a wait-and-see attitude toward creating jobs for the employed or getting the economy going again. \lineBreak Canadians want action on jobs now. Why will the ","Mr. Speaker, as I am sure the member opposite knows, our unemployment rate is too high, but it is much better than that in the United States, and that has not happened in more than a generation. \lineBreak The economic action plan actually is working and continues to work. We have about 600,000 net new jobs in Canada today since the end of the recession. We have the strongest job growth in the advanced economies in the world.  \lineBreak All of that is true. Should we do more? Yes, and we are with the accelerated capital cost allowance; the new tax credit for small businesses, more than 500,000 of them, to hire people; and the continuation of our tax reductions, which is just the opposite of what the NDP proposes, which is to raise taxes again."
491,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are outraged that the government is spending $90,000 a day for a consultant to help plan cuts to services that Canadians rely on. If we add it up, we could keep 230 front-line employees on the job for over a year. \lineBreak Why is the government throwing money at high-priced consultants while cutting staff who actually deliver services to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I know this would be contrary to NDP ideology, but there actually is some waste in government. Governments can actually reduce their expenses. We should not do it ourselves solely. We should get advice and expertise from the private sector. For every $1 of spending on experts, we expect $200 of savings, which is a pretty good deal."
492,"Mr. Speaker, the International Monetary Fund has reversed its predictions about Canada's economy, and is now warning that our unemployment rate is just going to keep climbing. While Canadians worry about the economy, Conservatives are throwing $90,000 a day at high-priced consultants, planning even deeper cuts. The minister is turning his back on communities that depend on these positions. When will Conservatives focus on Canadian families instead of throwing money at high-priced consultants?","Mr. Speaker, we are focused as a top priority on jobs and the economy. The record on jobs is about 600,000 net new jobs as a result of the economic action plan.  \lineBreak Let us see what the IMF actually said. Here is what the spokesman said just yesterday: “Canada is actually matching up quite well on a relative basis...growth rates are 2%, the recession was not too deep, they haven't had a financial crisis to the extent that the U.S. has had or the Europeans are having it, and so, all in all, Canada is actually doing quite well.”"
493,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are spending $90,000 a day for a high-priced outside consultant to plan service cuts. These cuts will have a direct and negative impact on Canadians, especially in rural regions. Seniors without Internet access and with limited access to public transit are being left behind by the government.  \lineBreak When will the government realize that paying private contractors top dollar to do its dirty work while short-changing seniors is certainly not the change Canadians were looking for?","Mr. Speaker, the deficit reduction action plan is necessary as we move on the fiscal track to balanced budgets. The member opposite should know that there is some waste in government, that it is possible to review programs, that not every program should go on forever, that sometimes there are new programs, sometimes there are programs that have completed their usefulness.  \lineBreak Certainly, it is the obligation of government to get the best advice we can, including the advice we will get from outside consultants. As I said, for every $1 spent on experts, we expect $200 of savings."
494,"Mr. Speaker, our seniors deserve better. \lineBreak By significantly reducing the services offered at Service Canada centres, the Conservative government is showing no consideration whatsoever for our seniors. Apparently, according to the minister, anyone who cannot communicate with Service Canada over the Internet is unworthy of the 21st century. That is unacceptable. \lineBreak Can the minister tell us here today how the cuts to Service Canada will better serve our seniors?","Mr. Speaker, we want to modernize our employment insurance system, especially the processing of claims. At this time, processing is done mainly on paper. This is not working. With an automated system, Service Canada employees will have more time to help seniors, and this will be more affordable for seniors. We promised Canadians that we would respect their money and that is what we are doing."
495,"Mr. Speaker, instead of spending $90,000 a day on learning how to cut public services, the government should put more resources into investigating how the Canada Revenue Agency bureaucrats were able to help a convicted fraudster escape paying taxes. \lineBreak Money laundering, $12 million in cash spent in casinos, and CRA private documents found in his safe in a building belonging to a mobster; after these troubling allegations, can the government explain what is going on at the Canada Revenue Agency?","Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to clarify that many of these allegations date back more than a decade. They are not new allegations. CRA officials are working with the RCMP, and the investigation is ongoing.  \lineBreak We do appreciate that this is a very serious issue and we will not tolerate these types of activities as they are alleged."
496,"Mr. Speaker, if the government is so determined to make cuts, then perhaps it could cut off fraudsters instead of cutting services to honest citizens. \lineBreak Canadians work hard for their money. We cannot blame them for being worried when they see how badly public funds are being managed. We have to shed light on what is happening at the Canada Revenue Agency. \lineBreak Can the government assure us that it will get to the bottom of things and investigate these serious allegations?","Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member and the House that the RCMP is investigating this matter. It is a very serious matter. CRA officials are working with the RCMP, and we will get to the bottom of the issue."
497,"Mr. Speaker, while senior bureaucrats in the Summit Management Office, Infrastructure Canada and Industry Canada categorically told the Auditor General they had no direct involvement in the G8 legacy fund, we know that is not true. Either they were misrepresenting the facts, or perhaps they were simply moved beyond the reach of the Auditor General. \lineBreak Here are simple questions for the ","Mr. Speaker, that is not correct. As I said yesterday, the facts have not changed. The Auditor General has made some observations with respect to the administration of this program and has given us some pointers. \lineBreak We must not forget about the good news coming out of this. The good news is that every dollar is accounted for. All 32 projects came in on or under budget. And guess what? The project itself was under $5 million."
498,"Mr. Speaker, diverting $50 million from border infrastructure to build outhouses in Muskoka is not a simple thing to pull off. The  \lineBreak Is it not true that he went to local mayors and said that he personally would set up the meeting with the ","Mr. Speaker, again, that is incorrect, but let me talk about the good news on this infrastructure funding. \lineBreak This infrastructure funding was recommended by the municipalities. It enhanced the municipalities' infrastructure program. I will tell members what infrastructure programs the money was spent on: rehabilitation of the airport in North Bay, fixing up the provincial highway, and building a community centre that was used during the summer. What is wrong with that picture?"
499,"Mr. Speaker, at last year's G20 meeting, my city was shut down. It was shaken. It was vandalized. A year later the government will still not pick up the tab. Gazebos, yes, but Toronto business owners with smashed windows is another story.  \lineBreak If it is not pork-barrelling, why will the government not reimburse Toronto businesses? When will it fix the deeply flawed summit management protocol so that the next time small businesses will not get hung out to dry?","Mr. Speaker, the losses and damages to Toronto businesses are regrettable. The claims process is an independent process that has been in place since the previous government in 2001 and has been used successfully at previous summits. Following this review, Toronto businesses were treated the same as those affected at summits at Quebec City and Kananaskis. \lineBreak  This government is committed to providing a fair share to Toronto businesses."
500,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians cannot put up with this Conservative government's waste and mismanagement. It is wasting $90,000 a day to have consultants tell it where to cut government spending. \lineBreak Why can the cabinet ministers not make these decisions themselves? What exactly are Canadians paying these ministers to do?","Mr. Speaker, we do not share the view that the member opposite clearly has that governments are the font of all wisdom and all knowledge and that governments should just examine themselves and come to their own conclusions without getting advice that is available in the private sector in Canada, very good advice. Therefore, yes, we are seeking that advice. For every $1 of spending on experts, we expect $200 of savings."
501,"Mr. Speaker, under the Conservatives, spending on consultants is up by $3 billion per year. \lineBreak  I served on the cabinet expenditure review committee led by the member for  \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives outsource their thinking? Is it because the ","Mr. Speaker, as if the leader of the Liberal Party then and the NDP did not do enough damage to Ontario between 1990 and 1995, now we have the member from the third party here saying that the Liberals did a good job on deficit reduction through their work. Sure, they did. They reduced funding for hospitals. They reduced funding for teachers, for education. They reduced funding for nurses in the province of Ontario. This is shameful."
502,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the omnibus crime bill was tabled in the House. It—",Say thank you.
503,"Conservatives are in complete denial over there about the serious financial consequences this is going to have to the budgetary process in our country, both provincially and federally. For instance, a single part of the bill will create several thousand plus additional people going into jail that we are going to have to pay for. We all deplore the cost of crime, but we have to have budgetary transparency.  \lineBreak When will one of the two ministers stand in the House and tell us what this bill is going to cost Canadian taxpayers?","Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting that the hon. member has now become a fiscal conservative. He is worried about government expenditures. This certainly is something new. \lineBreak If he is worried, I can assure him that most of the cost of crime is borne by victims. A study in 2008 said that the cost of crime in the country was $99 billion, and 83% was borne by victims of crime. \lineBreak Why do those members not stand up for victims of crime for a change? Why not make that a priority?"
504,"Mr. Speaker, all the minister and the government are going to do is dump more costs onto that $99 billion figure, which is really questionable. \lineBreak It is unacceptable that the government is refusing to disclose these costs. This bill will transfer the financial responsibilities to the provinces, which are already short on resources. The provinces are asking for help, but the government is refusing to listen to them.  \lineBreak Can the minister tell us how much this bill is going to cost the provinces? How much?","Mr. Speaker, I have good news for the hon. member. Provinces right across the country have been supportive of these government initiatives. I can also tell him that just in the last budget an increase of more than $2.4 billion was given to the provinces. \lineBreak If that individual wants to get on board with this, he should start standing up for victims, people who are the victims of sexual exploitation, do something about drug trafficking in the country and get behind this bill and support it right now. "
505,"Mr. Speaker, in the last Parliament, the NDP fought to stop the Conservatives from passing legislation allowing police officers to spy on citizens on the Internet without a warrant. Since this measure is not included in the omnibus crime bill, it is a victory for the NDP and all Canadians. \lineBreak Can the government confirm that it will, once and for all, heed the experts and the vast majority of the population, who are opposed to surveillance without a warrant?","Mr. Speaker, outrageous claims like that one, that private communications will be intercepted without a warrant, are a complete fabrication. Our proposed approach of linking an Internet address to subscriber information is on par with the phone book linking phone numbers to an address. What this will not allow for is access to private communications without a warrant.  \lineBreak Our message is clear. If someone wants to commit a crime, we will ensure that laws are in place to ensure that individual is apprehended, and those laws will be done in an appropriate lawful manner."
506,"Mr. Speaker, even former Minister of Public Safety Stockwell Day was opposed to electronic surveillance without a warrant. \lineBreak Can the minister confirm that his government is admitting that this surveillance initiative, an even greater intrusion into the lives of Canadians, has been abandoned? Can he guarantee today that it has been abandoned once and for all?","Mr. Speaker, I do not understand where the member is getting his information from. This type of outrageous claim that lawful access would not be appropriately enacted by our government is simply that, outrageous. \lineBreak The legislation will come. It will provide for appropriate judicial oversight in respect of access to private conversations.  \lineBreak Rather than repeating fabrications, the member might want to come and talk to me about what we are actually planning."
507,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has become the envy of the world when it comes to our economic position. Just yesterday a senior International Monetary Fund official said of our economy “all in all Canada is doing quite well”. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, today the  \lineBreak As members know, our government's top priority remains completing the economic recovery, and that is our  \lineBreak Canadians gave our Conservative government a strong mandate to stay focused on what matters, creating jobs and economic growth.

We have conducted a grassroots outreach strategy implemented by the Assembly of First Nations and other aboriginal organizations. We did this in 16 aboriginal languages, English and French. This overall outreach strategy was developed by all parties to the settlement and approved by the courts. It has been deemed highly effective by the courts and all the parties to the agreement. The outreach is ongoing."
509,"Mr. Speaker, National Chief Shawn Atleo has told us aboriginal high school students are more likely to be incarcerated than to graduate. Aboriginal women make up a whopping one-third of women in custody. \lineBreak Anyone who commits a crime must face justice, but is it not equally important to prevent involvement in criminal activities in the first place? Instead of building more jails, why will the government not invest in better education and job creation for aboriginal Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, we have made major investments in education and in other developments to a degree that no other government has ever done. We have, right now, a national panel going across the country on K to 12 education. We did that in collaboration. The Assembly of First Nations, the National Chief and myself appointed the panel. It is working quite independently. This is a major development with positive outcomes. This is the right way to go, and we are making those kinds of investments."
510,"Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Walk 4 Justice gathered on Parliament Hill, asking for answers about the hundreds of missing and murdered aboriginal women in Canada. \lineBreak Back in February, Conservatives refused to renew funding they promised for Sisters in Spirit. This project tracked cases and gave a voice to communities facing this violence, yet Conservatives have severely hindered this groundbreaking initiative. \lineBreak Why is the government shutting out the voices of the families and the affected communities?","Mr. Speaker, it is quite the opposite. Through our national strategy to deal with this very difficult issue of murdered and missing aboriginal women, we have a community, a fund component that we are working very closely with community organizations in aboriginal communities across the country. I can list one of them. I have dozens here that I could use as examples. For instance, the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake is providing information sessions that will enhance knowledge and access to justice for victims of family violence.  \lineBreak The community organizations are from aboriginal communities and are working closely with the public safety, justice and status of women departments to ensure we get them the help that they need."
511,"Mr. Speaker, for a government that claims to be the champion of law and order, the Conservatives' attitude towards violence against aboriginal women is hard to understand. In the last three months, Walk4Justice has had to add 37 names to its list of missing women. Federal resources are needed to protect these victims who have no voice. \lineBreak How can communities provide support to the families of the victims without the assistance of this government?","Mr. Speaker, funding is important. Just to put it into perspective, just one organization, the Native Women's Association of Canada, has received almost $20 million from our government alone. \lineBreak However, what I think is most important is that now we are working with law enforcement agencies across the country, including the RCMP's new missing persons' centre. We have created a public website for tips from the public to help find missing and murdered aboriginal women. We have enhanced our databases for all law enforcement agencies across the country. However, more importantly, we are working with women's aboriginal organizations at the community level to help support them."
512,"Mr. Speaker, on Monday once again the  \lineBreak If assessing and reducing industrial impacts on our environment are not considered basic services, then what is?","Mr. Speaker, my colleague is well aware that the environment is a priority for the Government of Canada during these times of fiscal restraint. \lineBreak I can assure her that budget 2011, while it did reassign some resources, can cover without compromising any of the programs of my department."
513,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday and then again today, the  \lineBreak I asked on Monday, I asked on Tuesday, and I am going to ask again today: can the minister show us evidence of the impacts of these cuts?","Mr. Speaker, I can again say there is a great difference between letters to employees of Environment Canada advising them that they may be affected by workforce adjustment and separation from the department. It is entirely possible that all of the positions will be accommodated through attrition. The proof will be in the pudding as we continue to deliver the services for cleaner air and for protecting our great public spaces for the good of the people of Canada."
514,"Mr. Speaker, in a recent survey conducted by the American news outlet  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member from Miramichi for her tireless work for women.  \lineBreak Our government has increased funding for women to its highest level ever, and we are working hard with women across the country to ensure they achieve their full potential. Women can count on our government to pursue measures that create jobs and growth, to end elder abuse, to protect our health care system, and of course to end violence against women and girls.  \lineBreak We are very proud that Canada is ranked third-best place to be a woman in the world, third only to Iceland and Sweden. "
515,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak The Commissioner of Official Languages has asked the government several times to introduce a bill to clarify the responsibilities of Air Canada and its affiliates with regard to providing services in French and English. In May 2010, 252 hon. members unanimously called on the government to do the same. The minister's two immediate predecessors promised to do so, but did not. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, Air Canada is responsible for meeting its official language requirements with its partner companies. We are ensuring that the official languages are respected and we will continue to do so."
516,"Mr. Speaker, the Prince Edward Island provincial nominee program has raised alarm bells for Islanders and all Canadians.  \lineBreak Recently three government workers have come forward with allegations of bribery and fraud within this program. These total over $400 million, apparently in violation of the rules, with no accountability but with political interference.  \lineBreak Islanders and all Canadians deserve to know the truth. Will the government conduct an inquiry into the disturbing allegations staining this federal program?","Mr. Speaker, these are new allegations and they were recently provided to officials at the ministry. Those allegations have been provided to the RCMP. To be fair, because they are under investigation, it would not be fair for the government to comment further. "
517,"Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government has invested more in science and technology than any other government in Canadian history. When it comes to supporting basic discovery-oriented university research, Canada is ranked number one among the G7 countries. Our government's commitment to science and technology is paying dividends.  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for joining me at the grand opening of the Stephen Hawking Centre at the Perimeter Institute just recently.  \lineBreak This brand new federally funded facility will make the Perimeter Institute the largest theoretical physics research and academic organization the world.  \lineBreak This year we have invested more in the Perimeter Institute, showing our government's ongoing commitment to building a stronger economy, creating those job opportunities of the future and improving the standard of living for all Canadians through science and technology. "
518,I think most of the noise was coming from the  \lineBreak I wonder if the minister could now explain--,"Order, order. I know it is a Wednesday, but we will have to listen to the question before we can listen to the answer.  \lineBreak The hon. member for Toronto Centre."
519,"I did not know knuckle grazing could cause so much noise, Mr. Speaker. \lineBreak I wonder if the minister could tell us, in negotiating with respect to perimeter security, why, when faced with the buy American problem, why, when faced with the labelling problem, would ending trade discrimination not be  part and parcel of those negotiations?","Mr. Speaker, our government is focused on reducing barriers to trade, not raising new barriers, as some parties in the House have suggested. \lineBreak Sixty per cent of our GDP is comprised of trade. One in five Canadian jobs is directly or indirectly related to trade, so any suggestion that we should be adding to the barriers that face our businesses is absolutely wrong. "
520,"Mr. Speaker, I think the minister misunderstood the question I asked. Being a charitable man, I will repeat the question in my second language. \lineBreak What I am trying to say is very simple. At a time when we are facing a real risk of discrimination against the Canadian economy with regard to our exports to the United States, why not make this issue of discrimination part of our negotiations with the Americans on security? ","Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the member listened to my answer. Had he been listening to the "
521,"Mr. Speaker, the government's inability to effectively manage the economy puts Canada at greater risk of a recession. The markets are tanking. Scotiabank, Moody's and the IMF have issued serious warnings to the government. Unfortunately, the Conservatives are not heeding these warnings. They refuse to see that there is a difference between spending and investing. It is time to invest. It is not time to cut services. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, this analysis is completely false. I was in New York, and the reality is that the world has great confidence in Canada. However, economic uncertainty is on the rise everywhere in the world as a result of certain difficulties, particularly the sovereign debt of certain countries. Today, Prime Minster Cameron and I put out a letter encouraging world leaders to act in a way that will allow us to continue the global economic recovery."
522,"Mr. Speaker, cuts to public services this year and next year will account for approximately 1% of the GDP. The IMF is saying that cuts of this order will have the same negative effect on the economy. In short, the cuts the Conservatives are making to public services will make a recession even more likely.  \lineBreak The Governor of the Bank of Canada is saying that the government can help the economy by making strategic investments. Why is the government doing the opposite? ","Mr. Speaker, the "
523,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are refusing to acknowledge Canada's economic challenges. Economists say that the real unemployment rate, which is all Canadians who would work if there were jobs for them, is up to 11%. That is almost two million unemployed Canadians. Today we learned that less than one in three qualify for EI. \lineBreak Where is the plan to get people back to work?","Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the fact that unemployment remains too high, the world knows that Canada has one of the best employment job creation records in the industrialized world. I always appreciate ideas from the opposition to improve that, but good ideas do not include raising debt and raising taxes, as that party advocates. \lineBreak Today, Prime Minister Cameron, I and other world leaders have put out a letter encouraging those leaders around the world, who are in countries that are encouraging global economic uncertainty, to act in a way that will allow us to continue the economic recovery.  \lineBreak The world has great confidence in the policies we are following in Canada. We need to see more of that around the world."
524,"Mr. Speaker, the government prefers to boast about doing better than Greece rather than helping the two million unemployed in this country. There is no shortage of projects in which we could invest and create jobs. The Champlain Bridge is a perfect example. \lineBreak The "," Mr. Speaker, the government did not wait. We acted and we acted quickly. \lineBreak After we took government, we paid down $37 billion in debt. That is what put us in the position where we could stimulate the economy. What happened with that stimulus? Our country has 600,000 more people working now because of our economic action plan."
525,"Mr. Speaker, two million Canadians who want to work cannot. That represents tens of billions of dollars in lost wages and spending in our domestic economy. That is a tragedy for those families and a real drag on our economy. Putting these Canadians back to work is just the sort of measure that would help solve the government's deficit problem. \lineBreak Experts and economists agree with the opposition. Why is the government so resistant to sound economic logic? Why is it refusing to act?","Mr. Speaker, excuse me for confusing sound economic policy with anything the NDP puts forward. That is not exactly the case. In fact, as the "

That is why Canada has one of the best job creation records in the industrialized world. \lineBreak Obviously we are concerned about developments and we always look for useful ideas from everyone in terms of how to move our economy forward. I would encourage the leader of the Liberal Party to suggest some of those ideas. After all, the Liberals just ran an election campaign without a single important thing in terms of an economic platform."
527,"Mr. Speaker, we will make a very specific suggestion: that, in the North American security perimeter negotiations, the government promote Canadian interests and seek assurances that the “Buy American” initiative will not discriminate against Canadian companies. It will result in job losses and be very detrimental to the Canadian economy. \lineBreak What is the ","Mr. Speaker, negotiations about the perimeter are negotiations about our access to the American economy. It is the same thing that the Liberal Party leader is asking for. I urge the Liberal Party to support this very important initiative to guarantee that we have access to the American market."
528,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister claimed that many of the allegations of fraud at the Canadian Revenue Agency date back “more than a decade”. \lineBreak If allegations date back so long, why are we only hearing about them now? The CRA needs to be a credible and trusted agency by all Canadians, not a safe haven for fraudsters. \lineBreak Could the minister tell this House why the government was sitting on its hands, without conducting a proper investigation?","Mr. Speaker, the government has been conducting proper investigations and the government is co-operating fully with the RCMP into these matters. \lineBreak We do appreciate this is a very serious issue. We will not tolerate the types of activities that have been alleged."
529,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are sick of seeing this government blame its predecessors. The Conservatives can certainly ask Canadians to tighten their belts, but the least they can do in return is ensure that public funds are managed responsibly and transparently. \lineBreak In light of what is happening at the Canada Revenue Agency, why is the minister waiting for the RCMP to investigate before taking real steps to reassure the public?","Mr. Speaker, this matter is in the hands of the RCMP.  \lineBreak As I did say, many of these allegations date back more than a decade. Some of them are now going through the court process and that is why we are reading about them in the media. \lineBreak I can assure the House that the RCMP and officials at CRA are co-operating fully, and this matter is being investigated."
530,"Mr. Speaker, a tightening of the tax fraud sanctions by the United States will have an impact on one million Canadians. Only a small fraction of people with dual citizenship are aware of these requirements.

Three days into the visit I participated in a search and rescue demonstration with 103 Squadron of 9 Wing Gander. I shortened my stay by a day to take part in that demonstration and later flew on to do government business in Ontario."

534,"Mr. Speaker, being picked up at a cost of $16,000 from a fishing camp is not the way to learn how search and rescue helicopters operate. \lineBreak Average Canadians are being told to tighten their belts, but when it comes to the minister and his department's use of military aircraft, money is apparently no object. \lineBreak How can we count on this minister to provide leadership on this issue when he himself treats a search and rescue helicopter as private transportation?","Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the work of the Canadian Forces, particularly those who take part in search and rescue. \lineBreak Canada has a rescue area of responsibility of over 18 million square kilometres of land and sea, the size of continental Europe. Our Canadian Forces and Coast Guard partners respond to more than 8,000 incidents every year, tasking military aircraft for over 1,100 cases, and in fact save on average 1,200 lives each and every year. \lineBreak I think that as Minister of National Defence I should familiarize myself at every opportunity with the important work of those who perform these daily heroics."
535,"Mr. Speaker, this Conservative government is planning to make cuts to the Department of National Defence, but it is clear that those at the top will not be affected. While the minister and his staff are gallivanting around the country at taxpayers' expense, departmental staff are being shown the door. \lineBreak Can the minister tell the House that it will not just be employees who have to tighten their belts?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am very proud of the work of the Canadian Forces. I have observed the work they do in Operation Nanook in the Arctic. I have observed search and rescue activities. I have observed live fire operations, as have members of the opposition who take part in the parliamentary Canadian Forces program. \lineBreak I can confirm that all government departments are looking at their departments for efficiencies, as Canadians would expect them to do, as Canadians and businesses themselves are doing."
536,"Mr. Speaker, I have some advice for the government on how to save money, and I will not be charging $90,000 a day. It should start by reducing the spending of its own ministers. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom takes commercial flights when visiting other leaders, as he did recently to visit President Obama. \lineBreak Why do our ministers not walk the talk by cutting their wasteful and extravagant spending, such as the ","Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary program put on by the Canadian Forces every year has the enthusiastic participation of members of Parliament, including members of the opposition. \lineBreak I note that the member for  \lineBreak This is a great opportunity for members of Parliament to see first-hand the important, critical, life-saving work that the men and women in uniform perform each and every day on behalf of our country."
537,"Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government is focused on what matters to Canadians: creating jobs and promoting economic growth. \lineBreak This week, the IMF forecasted Canada's overall economic growth will lead in the G7 over the next two years, an example of our global economic leadership. \lineBreak Our  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, once again, our top priority remains the economic recovery, both at home and abroad. That is why our  \lineBreak Canada's role is very important. Why? It is important because our experience and our success in implementing Canada's economic plan and our low tax plan to return to balance serves as a very strong and forceful example to other countries."
538,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister said he simply wants to optimize our ozone monitoring services. Yet all experts agree that resources are needed to study the ozone layer effectively, and they are worried about the cuts. This past winter, the ozone layer was thinner than ever. Scientists around the globe have praised the existing monitoring programs. \lineBreak Why is the government jeopardizing this research with cuts to the environmental sector?","Mr. Speaker, once again, the preamble to the question is false. \lineBreak I will be very clear. Environment Canada will continue to monitor ozone. The World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre will continue to deliver world-class services. \lineBreak This government will continue to protect the environment in the most cost effective way as possible."
539,"Mr. Speaker, the minister is mortgaging our future. We need this data now more than ever. Climate change is accelerating the thinning of the ozone layer, which, I would remind the minister, is what protects us from harmful UV radiation. I would remind the minister that these ozone monitoring programs are a made-in-Canada solution to an international problem. We should be showcasing them, not shortchanging them. \lineBreak Why does the minister refuse to be upfront with Canadians about the impacts of his cuts on our environment?","Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for correcting my flawed French. \lineBreak I will be very clear. Environment Canada continually reviews its programs, aligning staff and resources where they will have the greatest impact. We will continue to monitor ozone. The World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre will continue to deliver its world-class services. "
540,"Mr. Speaker, the Keystone pipeline project raises great concerns in both Canada and the United States. In fact, environmental consequences are still unknown and it may lead to an uncontrolled expansion of the tar sands.  \lineBreak At a time when Canada needs a plan for job creation, why is the government ready to sell out Canadian workers and ship thousands of jobs south of the border?","Mr. Speaker, our government is concentrating on what matters to Canadians, that is to say, jobs and economic growth.  \lineBreak The fact is that the oil sands are responsible for over 140,000 jobs across Canada. The job number is expected to grow to almost half a million jobs. That is how many jobs the opposition members say no to when they bash Canada abroad."
541,"Mr. Speaker, the government refuses to strike a balance between protecting our environment and developing the oil sands. \lineBreak The unbridled development of the oil sands cannot go on at the expense of our long-term economic and environmental prosperity. \lineBreak Why is the government giving up our resources and our jobs and getting nothing in return, apart from pollution and unemployment?","Mr. Speaker, the opposition needs to stop knocking Canada's economic growth and start supporting the hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on the oil sands industry. Employment in Canada is far too important to be used to try to gain some kind of partisan political advantage. "
542,"Mr. Speaker, the government is no friend to the refugee community. We just need to look at the anti-smuggling bill and how it tried to demonize refugees as a whole.  \lineBreak Today, a family of refugees will be arriving here in Canada. The  \lineBreak I look to the ","Mr. Speaker, the member knows, as do all Canadians, that we have a very fair and just refugee system in this country. In fact, so much so that we ensure that we will improve upon that system with Bill C-11, the refugee reform act, of which every member of the 41st Parliament supported unanimously."
543,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak The infant mortality rate in the aboriginal population in Canada is two to four times higher than in the non-aboriginal population. \lineBreak When will the minister commit to responding to the Health Council of Canada's damning report so that we can better understand and improve the health of aboriginal children and mothers in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of aboriginal Canadians is a top priority for the government. We have entered into agreements with provinces on child and family services. This is an area where we have agreement between the federal government, the provinces and the territories that there needs to be care and attention paid to this and we are happy to enter into those agreements."
544,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak After the last buy America plan, the government pledged to negotiate exemptions for Canada on any similar deals. However, instead, it did nothing, and now we have been shut out again.  \lineBreak When will the government stop playing politics with this issue and start negotiating trade deals that actually protect Canadian jobs?","Mr. Speaker, the "
545,"Mr. Speaker, what have the Conservatives been doing the last couple of years? They have been sleeping at the switch. \lineBreak The last time around, by the time the government got involved, Canadian firms got access to $1.3 billion, 0.5%, of the stimulus program. In return, U.S. companies got access to $25 billion worth of Canadian contracts. The math just does not add up.  \lineBreak Why is the government bowing to the Americans over and over again instead of putting Canadian procurement and Canadian jobs first?","Mr. Speaker, that is pretty rich coming from an individual in a party that actually has a senior member, one of its MPs, contemplating running for the leadership of the party and has a motion before the House calling for the same trade measures to be implemented in Canada. This government is focused on removing trade barriers, not erecting new ones. \lineBreak We are focused on building the economic prosperity of this country. We are standing up for ordinary, hard-working Canadians. Why are they not?"
546,"Mr. Speaker, today,  \lineBreak Could the minister reiterate the rules and regulations on union donations to political parties because, clearly, the NDP needs a reminder?","Mr. Speaker, that type of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and breaks Canadian election laws. The Canada Elections Act clearly indicates that corporate and union donations are not allowed. Political parties are required to raise their money through donations from ordinary Canadians.  \lineBreak Elections Canada has been asked to investigate these sponsorships, but the NDP and its union friends should not wait for an investigation to provide transparency.  \lineBreak We urge the New Democrats to provide full disclosure of all contributions. Canadians deserve to know the full extent to which big unions have been subsidizing the NDP."
547,"Mr. Speaker, with great surprise we hear the Conservatives' spin on job creation when the complete opposite is happening in Cape Breton.  \lineBreak Since 2008, when those guys came into power, we have lost 10,000 jobs and the closures of an automotive plant, a pharmaceutical plant, a call centre and now a pulp and paper mill. However, that was not enough. They are going to get rid of 120 Service Canada jobs in Cape Breton. \lineBreak Why will the minister from Nova Scotia not save some jobs in Cape Breton, get some jobs and not go on his fishing trips paid by the hard-working taxpayers of Canada?","Mr. Speaker, as I have explained every day this week, and perhaps the member should focus on what is said here, during the global recession we hired a number of people to help us deal with a spike in applications for employment insurance. The good news is that, thanks to our economic action plan, more Canadians are at work now than before the recession. That means there are fewer EI applications to be processed.  \lineBreak The jobs were temporary. We are respecting taxpayers' money in that regard and that is why there will be fewer employees. They were temporary jobs and they knew it, but we will respect Canadian taxpayers."
548,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the  \lineBreak Every week we hear about more and more of Canada's heroes being homeless and using food banks. In Alberta, Jonathan Denis, the housing minister, now says that Alberta will pick up the slack where the federal government has failed. \lineBreak My question is quite simple. Why is the federal government abdicating its responsibility to veterans in our country, having the provinces pick up that responsibility?"," Mr. Speaker, not only are we working with our partners, but we are taking decisive action to reduce homelessness in our country and among veterans. That is why we have established outreach initiatives in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver to provide assistance to homeless veterans, and also in all our district offices. \lineBreak  I was in Toronto this summer and I could see the action of the Good Shepherd Ministries on the ground in downtown Toronto, and of our officials working hand in hand in the refuge with those people.  \lineBreak We are helping our veterans to transition to civilian life in a seamless manner and we will keep up that work."
549,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives thought that it was a good idea to offer $90,000 a day on a silver platter to a consulting firm with annual revenues of over $3 billion. Let us be clear: this $20 million of public money that is going into the pockets of Deloitte is equivalent to the operating budget of the Club des petits déjeuners du Québec for two years. \lineBreak Do the Conservatives at least realize how out of touch they are with the priorities and needs of the people?","Mr. Speaker, private sector advice is a key part of our plan to ensure that Canada does not experience the economic and financial problems that other countries in the world are experiencing. \lineBreak It is important to seek advice, not only from the public service but also from private sector experts. We are proud of that. We are proud of the fact that this government focuses on the real issues: jobs for Canadians, economic recovery. That is what we focus on and that is what the opposition should focus on as well."
550,"Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Conservatives' enlightening explanations, we have learned that for every $1 spent on consulting, we expect to save $200. The way they see it, the more we spend, the more we save. That is not really a logic that I would suggest to Canadian families right now. The reality is that with this amount of money, we could create 450 good jobs that would guarantee good public services. \lineBreak Today we learned that at Public Works and Government Services Canada alone, consulting fees have doubled and have reached $1.8 billion. \lineBreak Has the government lost all control over public spending?","Mr. Speaker, as the  \lineBreak It is important that we get that outside advice. It is important that we focus on finding savings, so that we can still be an economy and country that other countries look to for leadership. Our "
551,"Mr. Speaker, $90,000 a day for consultants. The citizens of Toronto have seen this movie before and they know what happens when private consultants are hired to find cuts. Toronto paid millions for its consultant report and now arts, recreation centres, child care, transit, even public health are on the chopping block.  \lineBreak We know that members of the government, including the ","Mr. Speaker, we have a strong mandate from the people of Canada. They want a government to spend within its means. They want to make sure that essential, good services delivered by the Government of Canada continue to be delivered in an efficient and effective manner. That is our mandate from the people of Canada. \lineBreak We do not want to raise taxes. We do not want to have the kind of spending programs that the opposition members have. We want to deliver high quality services to Canadians and spend within our means. That is our mandate."
552,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canadians learned that we were ranked third best country in the world to be a women. This bodes very well for the girls here at home. \lineBreak Despite progress, girls continue to face barriers that hamper their development. On March 24, the House unanimously passed a motion, brought forward by the  \lineBreak Could the minister update us on Canada's efforts on this important initiative?","Mr. Speaker, the International Day of the Girl will provide a key opportunity to consider girls' rights and raise awareness around the world. There are places in the world where girls are deprived of basic rights only because they were born girls.  \lineBreak We are working successfully with countries around the world, as we submit our proposal to the United Nations in October, to shed light on the discrimination and injustice suffered by girls. \lineBreak Girls deserve to go to school and to have a full life. With Canada's leadership at the United Nations, we will support girls' rights all over the world."
553,"Mr. Speaker, since 2006, the number of affordable housing units has dropped by 17,000. People with access to adequate, affordable and safe housing are far less likely to end up on the street, develop addiction problems or commit crimes. It is called prevention; however, the Conservatives prefer repression.  \lineBreak Rather than imposing additional costs for prisons on the provinces, why does the government not support them by investing in new social housing units? ","Mr. Speaker, three years ago, we introduced Canada's economic action plan. That is what our government did. To stimulate the economy, we invested a lot of money in the very type of affordable housing to which the hon. member is referring. Fourteen thousand projects were completed, as well as renovations. It is the hon. member's party that voted against all these efforts."
554,"Mr. Speaker, after learning about a $90,000-a-day contract for advice on where to cut in order to eliminate the deficit, now we have learned that the Conservatives paid nearly $2 billion to private consultants in 2010-11, and that was in the public works department alone. To add insult to injury, at the beginning of the summer, that department laid off public servants who could have done the job internally for a lot less money. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is always looking for ways to save taxpayer money. We will ensure that when situations arise where it is cheaper to bring in experts from the outside for the short term, we will do just that. We believe there are cases when contracting outside is cheaper and more flexible than it is to maintain someone on the public payroll."
555,"Mr. Speaker, since this is my first opportunity to ask the traditional Thursday question, I want to officially greet my counterpart, the  \lineBreak Since the beginning of the week, the government has assured us that its top priority would be the economy. What we got instead was leftovers from the past few years that the Conservatives have reheated and are dumping on Parliament's plate. The economy was supposed to be their top priority, but instead we got served their law and order agenda. \lineBreak What is the plan for the rest of this week and next week? Is the agenda going to start reflecting what was meant to be their top priority? I would also like the ","Mr. Speaker, as the opposition House leader quite astutely noted, our priority is the economy. We saw that already with successes this spring when we introduced a budget that was adopted by the House. We introduced a budget implementation bill with measures like an increase to the old age security payments, which was also adopted by the House. We continue to pursue that economic agenda. \lineBreak Our other priority is also related to having a sound economy, and that is having safe communities and safe streets by combatting crime. As members know, there is a strong linkage between severe crime and harm to the economy. We obviously want to change that, and this is why we have moved in that direction. That is what we have been debating this week, primarily. \lineBreak In the next week, our government will continue to move forward with important bills that Canadians elected us to implement. Today we will continue debate on Bill  \lineBreak I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House just how long the measures in the safe streets and communities bill have been before this House and the other place. When we tally up all the days since those bills have been introduced, it has been a combined total of 2,700 days since their first introductions. That is almost 20 years of elapsed time that those bills have been before the House in one form or another. \lineBreak We have already had over 180 speeches given in the House on those bills, important law and order proposals as they are. Unfortunately, right now we are no longer actually debating the safe streets and communities bill; we are technically debating an opposition motion to delay and obstruct our efforts to tackle crime and get that bill passed. \lineBreak I urge all members to put aside their parliamentary maneuvers designed to delay and obstruct and give all members the opportunity to vote, once and for all, on the important measures included in the bill. \lineBreak Tomorrow, we will be debating Bill  \lineBreak As the  \lineBreak  Next Thursday, September 29, will be the first allotted day."
556,"Mr. Speaker, the fact that the Muskoka minister was able to divert $50 million in border infrastructure to be spent on dubious spending in his riding certainly gave him enormous political clout in the region. It may have even helped secure an election, which would be why he was setting up his meetings in the middle of the campaign. \lineBreak Will the minister confirm to this House whether or not he used his new-found power and clout to offer anyone a job related to the G8?","Mr. Speaker, that is incorrect. As I have said in the past in this House, the facts have not changed. The minister said that the infrastructure money and all the money was spent wisely, and under budget for the people of that riding. It was money very well spent and that is good news in that region."
557,"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the song and dance, but this is not a foreign affairs intervention. This is a question regarding the credibility of a minister.  \lineBreak I would like to ask the minister, when he was the minister of health he sent an email to a friend who asked if he would like to be retained by the town. The minister then contacted the mayor who said he would get on it right away. The Muskoka member replied “good stuff”.  \lineBreak Will the minister stand in the House and tell us whether or not he thinks this kind of pork barrel, backroom politics is an ethical way to run government?","Mr. Speaker, I do not understand why the opposition will not listen to the good news that was coming out from there. The whole project came in under $5 million. That is quite substantial. It was done. The Auditor General has looked at it and given a recommendation. Let us move on. It was a good project, let us move on."
558,"Mr. Speaker, the last few days have underlined once again what a gamble the government is taking with the retirement security of Canadians. Its so-called pooled pension scheme throws the retirement savings of Canadians into a market roulette wheel. On the other hand, the Bay Street fund managers will have guaranteed returns.  \lineBreak The government's preference for padding the pockets of financial managers while ignoring the needs of Canadians for pension security is what is happening. When will the Conservatives provide guaranteed retirement security for Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, we have been working very hard to improve Canadians' retirement security. Let us just go over some of the things that have been done. \lineBreak We cut taxes for seniors and pensioners by over $2 billion annually. That includes pension income splitting. We reformed the framework governing federally regulated pensions to better protect pensioners. We are working with the provinces. We studied proposals and we are going to make further improvements. Now, with them, we are working on the introduction of the new pooled registered pension plan. The PRPPs will provide low-cost pension plans to millions of people who never had a pension before."
559,"Mr. Speaker, the benefits of public sector versus private sector pension plans are clear. The Canada pension plan and the Quebec equivalent are less costly to manage and they are guaranteed. The problem is that the Conservatives are not allowing citizens to use their preferred method of saving. People want to see action on this file. Canadians should be able to invest their savings in public pension plans if they so desire. \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives prefer that people lose their shirts on the stock market?","Mr. Speaker, we have worked hard to increase retirement security for Canadians. For example, we cut taxes for seniors and pensioners by more than $2 billion, notably by allowing pension income splitting. We have worked with the provinces to look at proposals for other improvements and, as I said earlier, we are about to implement the pooled registered pension plan. The PRPP system will provide low-cost pension plans to millions of people who do not have a pension."
560,"Mr. Speaker, the past few months have brought us the protectionist buy American legislation, an economic downturn this quarter and a rising unemployment rate. Instead of helping Canadians by creating jobs, the Conservatives are using the situation as an excuse to cut and eliminate vital programs and services. Making cuts in a time of economic downturn only exacerbates the problem.  \lineBreak Will the government show some flexibility and put those cuts on hold until the economy is in a better position?","Mr. Speaker, our government cares about what matters most: the economy and jobs. Canada's current economic growth is proof that we are on the right track for Canadian families. Both the IMF and the OECD agree that Canada will have one of the fastest growing economies in the G7. In addition, Moody's has just renewed Canada's AAA credit rating because of our economic resiliency, financial strength and low susceptibility to event risk."
561,"Mr. Speaker, today Canadians learned that our military trainers in Afghanistan were involved in active combat last week when a NATO compound in Kabul came under attack. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak Will the government now acknowledge that there is no non-combat military role in a war?","Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, the combat mission in Afghanistan has now come to an end. We have transitioned to training. That training is taking place in and around Kabul. However, I do not think the member is naive enough to suggest that Canadian Forces are not going to protect themselves when in a volatile city like Kabul. They will return fire and protect themselves. That is what happened in this instance. The member and Canadians would expect no less."
562,"Mr. Speaker, this is holding the government to account that says one thing and then does the other. \lineBreak This incident undermines Canadians' trust in the government. We were told this would be a non-combat role. That is clearly not the case. We were told that our troops would be out of harm's way. However, the Canadian Forces say that Kabul is an extremely violent environment. \lineBreak  We were even denied a chance to debate and vote on this mission in the House of Commons. \lineBreak Why did the government mislead Canadians on this issue?","Mr. Speaker, I agree with some of what the hon. member is suggesting. \lineBreak  Yes, Kabul is a very dangerous environment. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the Canadian soldiers who are there, doing their fine work in training the Afghan national army and police. \lineBreak Yes, Canadian Forces will in fact protect themselves in that environment. As I said, the hon. member would expect no less.  \lineBreak To suggest somehow that the Canadian government has said there will be no danger in Kabul is completely wrong, and he is misleading the House."
563,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Is this the minister's way of familiarizing himself with all our different means of air and military transportation, or does he plan on becoming a pilot?","Mr. Speaker, taxpayers expect government officials to conduct the nation's business at a reasonable cost. It is something that our government takes very seriously. \lineBreak I want to be clear. Our use of government aircraft by our ministers is always in compliance with policy. We do follow the policies, and we have reduced the use of government aircraft significantly, as we have said.  \lineBreak When we look at Challenger use by the Liberals who spoke earlier about this issue, we have reduced our use 80% since they abused them as personal limousines constantly. We only use them for government business."
564,"Mr. Speaker, how can a lobster festival have anything to do with the army? Not so long ago, the  \lineBreak Why was a search and rescue helicopter used for a private fishing trip?","Mr. Speaker, taxpayers expect government officials to be careful and prudent in their use of government aircraft. However, they also expect government officials to carry out the government's business and sometimes that necessitates the use of government aircraft. We are very careful and prudent in doing so.  \lineBreak We will ensure that we continue to keep the costs of such use down and respect taxpayers' dollars; something that is certainly not a priority for that party across the aisle."
565,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the minister's office claimed that his flight on a search and rescue helicopter was part of a long-standing request, but now we have learned that the request to pick him up from his fishing trip was ordered at the last minute. \lineBreak After logging countless hours on Canadian Forces executive jets, does the minister now feel he is completely familiar with their operations, or does he need to jet around to a few more lobster festivals, just to make sure?","Mr. Speaker, our ministers and our government officials are proud to do the government's business. We are doing the government's business for the people of Canada, and we do so in a careful and prudent fashion that respects taxpayers' dollars. We will continue to do that. We are always very careful to respect taxpayers' dollars."
566,"Mr. Speaker, the Department of National Defence is becoming as leaky as a used British submarine: leaks coming out to discredit the brass and leaks about the minister's fondness for executive travel, for fishing trips, and lobster festivals. \lineBreak It seems the government is losing the confidence of the senior leadership in the Canadian Forces. Could the minister tell us who is running the show in his department?","Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the leadership within the Canadian Forces. Our chief of defence and down through the ranks have done an outstanding job: distinguishing themselves in international missions; responding to challenges here at home, whether it be floods or fires; and conducting themselves in concert with other government security forces during the Olympic games, during the G8 and G20.  \lineBreak Our Canadian Forces do a spectacular job. I could not be more proud of their leadership."
567,"Mr. Speaker, the illogical tale of the HMCS \lineBreak The government has made a claim that she will sail by 2013. Is it not true that the HMCS","No, Mr. Speaker, that is not true.  \lineBreak In fact, what we have are four submarines that have interchangeable parts. What we are doing, of course, is trying to have those submarines available for use.  \lineBreak No one would deny there have been challenges with respect to these submarines that were purchased by the previous government. In fact, submarines bring an important credibility and an important capability to the Royal Canadian Navy. We are going to continue to work with our officials to see that that capability is available to Canada. That asset is something that will serve our country well in the future. "
568,"Mr. Speaker, seriously, a former sailor says that there are only 80 qualified submariners in the entire Canadian Navy. Not so long ago, there were 300. Parts from HMCS  \lineBreak Will the government now admit that we will have to wait until 2016 before a single submarine is operational in the Canadian Navy?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, this is an important capability. The submarine program has been plagued with difficulties. These are very sophisticated vessels. One person compared their sophistication to the space shuttle in terms of the amount of equipment on board that submarine.  \lineBreak With respect to their availability, we have had use of those submarines at various times since taking possession of them. They are involved in an upgrade right now that will see their availability in the future, and we continue to work toward that process."
569," Mr. Speaker, after spending two very difficult years in Albania, Arjan Tabaj and his family are finally back in Canada. The Federal Court ruled that this family had been deported without justification.  \lineBreak Today another family is being separated by this government. Ms. Paola Ortiz came to Canada to escape a life of physical abuse. She is married and has two children. As we speak, she is on a plane headed back to Mexico, back to the hardship and violence she was fleeing. \lineBreak Why has the minister not intervened to avoid ripping this family apart?","Mr. Speaker, part of CBSA's mandate is to investigate and remove persons who are in violation of Canada's immigration laws. Those individuals who are assessed to be in violation and do receive orders, do receive due process before the law. They are subject to various levels of appeal, including a pre-removal risk assessment."
570,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has one of the best trained and most productive public services in the world. By blowing money on unnecessary high-priced consultants, the Conservatives are throwing money at a problem that does not exist. \lineBreak At a time when the government is preaching restraint, why is its budget for consultants totally out of control?","Mr. Speaker, reckless spending and out-of control debt are the key problems facing other countries today.  \lineBreak Private sector advice is an essential part of our plan to ensure Canada avoids the economic and financial problems that have plagued much of the rest of the world. For every dollar that is spent, we expect to receive $200 in savings."
571,"Mr. Speaker, this government is wasting money by creating a shadow public service. It is an insult to our government employees, it is an insult to our taxpayers, and it is another way for the government to reward its special friends. It does not make any sense to spend money to reduce expenses. \lineBreak Why is this government refusing to invest in job creation but throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars out the window on expensive consultants?","Mr. Speaker, Canada is not immune to the problems other countries are facing. Canadians gave us the strong mandate to protect and pursue Canada's economic recovery. Our government has a plan that involves keeping taxes low, creating employment for Canadians and ensuring economic growth. Irresponsible spending and uncontrollable debt are significant causes of the problems other countries are experiencing today."
572,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak We now know that the member for  \lineBreak As much as we love hearing from the member for ","Mr. Speaker, that kind of mud-raking by the opposition was rejected in the last election. \lineBreak I will be clear. The facts have not changed. This issue has been thoroughly aired. The Auditor General had all the government information.  \lineBreak This government is focused on what matters to Canadians, which is jobs and the economy."
573,"Mr. Speaker, next to out and out corruption, nothing offends the sensibilities of Canadians as much as patronage pork-barrelling.  \lineBreak We now know that the  \lineBreak It is that kind of “who you know” politics that fuels the cynicism in an already jaded electorate. \lineBreak I want to ask the Conservatives what ever happened to the Public Appointments Commission that was supposed to put an end to patronage. What ever happened to the Federal Accountability Act?","Mr. Speaker, maybe the hon. member should see his voting record and find out how they voted against it, because he will get the answer faster. \lineBreak The facts have not changed. This issue has been thoroughly aired. The Auditor General had all the government information. I will tell the member that this government is focused on jobs and working for the economy. That is what Canadians elected the government for."
574,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Liberals were up to their old tricks by once again obstructing our measures to get tough on crime. \lineBreak Our government's  \lineBreak Victims, police and Canadians are clear. It is time we put the rights of victims ahead of the rights of criminals and ensure that all criminals are held accountable. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong and clear mandate to continue making our streets and communities safer. \lineBreak During the election, we committed to introducing and passing comprehensive legislation within the first 100 days of sitting in the new Parliament. We are delivering on this promise.  \lineBreak We talk the talk and we walk the walk. On this side of the House, the message to law-abiding Canadians is that we got their back."
575,"Mr. Speaker, the minister's explanations to justify cuts to the budget for monitoring the ozone layer do not make sense. The minister claims that cuts are necessary to better monitor the pollution in the oil sands. The Conservatives are telling us that we have to sacrifice the ozone layer to better understand the pollution in the oil sands. The cuts will have consequences on the quality of our environment. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives not telling Canadians the truth?","Mr. Speaker, I will say again that Environment Canada will continue to monitor the ozone. The World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre will continue to deliver world-class services. Our government will continue to protect the environment in the most cost-effective way possible."
576,"Mr. Speaker, the minister continues to insist that the cuts to the ozone monitoring programs are harmless, and he makes it sound so simple. He says that we have two ozone measurements and now we are just going to have one. However, he is disregarding the science because they measure different things. \lineBreak Because of the minister's shortsightedness, now we will not have the data that we need to track the hole in the ozone layer. Why is the minister disregarding both science and common sense?","Mr. Speaker, my colleague has misquoted me, but I will assure her that the environment remains a key priority for this government, even at times of fiscal restraint. As we are doing across all of government, we will be taking a close look at all of our spending over the next year and the results of our deficit reduction action plan will be announced in the budget next spring."
577,"Mr. Speaker, the Keystone pipeline is another example of the government's failed economic and environmental policies. The pace of development in the oil sands means that the government will not even meet its own climate change targets. \lineBreak Will the minister explain why the government keeps summarily promoting this pipeline instead of defending the best interests of Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, the Keystone XL pipeline will provide a substantial economic benefit to both Canada and the United States. We trade oil, natural gas and electricity across our borders every day.  \lineBreak While the opposition continues to bash Canada abroad, our government will defend the Canadian economy, will defend Canadian resources and will defend the 600,000-plus Canadian jobs that we have created since the recession started."
578,"Mr. Speaker, the minister is talking about economic development, but we are talking about jobs. Workers in the region are very clear: the pipeline will cause the loss of thousands of good jobs in Canada.  \lineBreak Why is the government prepared to sell our jobs and our environment?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP talking about jobs and the oil sands is ridiculous. Its past environment critic has called for a moratorium on oil sands development that would kill tens of thousands of Canadian jobs. We know there are over 100,000 Canadian jobs that are tied to the oil sands. The NDP wants to stop every last one of them so it is willing to sacrifice good Canadian jobs. We are not willing to do that. We will stand up and defend Canadians."
579,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives on the Standing Committee on Official Languages rejected two motions to enforce the Official Languages Act. The opposition members want all subsidiaries of Air Canada to be subject to the act, which was rejected by the Conservatives. We also asked to examine the reason why Afghan detainee documents were not in both official languages, which was also rejected. \lineBreak Will the government start to work with us to enforce this legislation?","Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. \lineBreak We are happy to have started working together on the Standing Committee on Official Languages. Our government is determined to continue to protect and promote our country's two official languages. We allocated record funding to the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality."
580,"Mr. Speaker, when the Conservatives refuse to consider opposition proposals and motions, official language minority communities are the ones that suffer. There are consequences for the members of these communities who do not receive services in the language of their choice. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleague that we allocated record funding to the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality. This money will strengthen the country's existing official language minority communities and will bring language and culture to new communities across Canada. I hope that we can set partisanship aside and work together on this committee."
581,"Mr. Speaker, later today, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is due to address the United Nations General Assembly and perhaps table a resolution calling for full member status of a Palestinian state that does not yet exist. \lineBreak Given that the attention of the world is focused on the United Nations today, could the ","Mr. Speaker, the long-standing position of the Government of Canada has not changed. \lineBreak The only route to peace in this conflict is a peace negotiated by both parties. One of the states must be a Jewish state and recognized as such, while the Palestinian state must be a non-militarized one. \lineBreak Any unilateral action is unhelpful to the situation. We urge both parties to get back to the table to undertake constructive, peaceful talks that may one day lead to an acceptable solution for both parties."
582,"Mr. Speaker, my constituents in Thunder Bay are agonizing over the unexplained deaths of seven first nations students in seven years. One week ago, on Pikangikum First Nation a sixth young man this summer took his own life. \lineBreak Has the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to express condolences to the community of Pikangikum for its losses. My department has been in regular contact with the community of Pikangikum and continues to work with it and other partners to ensure lasting improvements in the community. \lineBreak We are working to address the nine recommendations made to our department in the Ontario coroner's report released this month and we will do everything we can to address the situation."
583,"Mr. Speaker, today the  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, as I reiterated earlier today and as Prime Minister Cameron said yesterday, Canada is indeed an example to follow. To quote the prime minister, “[Canada's] economic leadership has helped the Canadian economy to weather the global storms far better than many of [our] international competitors”. \lineBreak Today, Canada will continue that economic leadership by calling on the European governments to act swiftly to fix their debt issues and all European economies must tackle their debt overhang quickly to help secure the global economic recovery. Even more, countries with long-term debt problems must put in place and implement credible fiscal consolidation plans now."
584,"Mr. Speaker, by attacking the savings of Canadians with dual citizenship and imposing massive fines on them, the American government is threatening the financial security of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. The Conservatives responded by writing a letter. \lineBreak Why is the government allowing the United States to treat law-abiding Canadians as though they were tax-evading billionaires?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. We share Canadians' concerns about this situation. We raised those concerns directly with the American government. Most Canadians who are affected by this are honest, hard-working people who obey the law. We have to do more, which is why we asked the United States government to treat these people with clemency. We also clearly explained that the Canada Revenue Agency will not collect the fines imposed by the IRS under FBAR on their behalf."
585,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are only too happy to cave in to any U.S. demand when it comes to security, but they allow the U.S. to threaten Canadian jobs with its protectionist buy American policy, and now they have failed to defend law-abiding Canadians. \lineBreak Conservatives are eager to follow U.S. orders on border security, but they do nothing to protect our own citizens from the American taxman. \lineBreak Why will the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said just a moment ago in French, we have acted on this file. We have the same concerns that most Canadians have. That is why the  \lineBreak We do not believe that it is justified that Canadians who have bank accounts here, who are honest and credible taxpaying Canadians who simply did not know that they have to file these documents, should be targeted. We are going to continue to insist that our American counterparts work on this. We are going to insist that the CRA is not going to collect these taxes on their behalf."
586,"Mr. Speaker, Tunisians living in Canada want to vote during the upcoming Tunisian general election, but it seems as though they will not be able to vote because the government is telling them that Canada cannot be an electoral constituency in a foreign assembly. \lineBreak Does the minister know that Canada and the United States have elected officials in France's National Assembly? Does he know that the constituency being proposed by Tunisia includes Canada and the United States? \lineBreak Will the minister take the necessary measures to allow Tunisians living in Canada to vote?","Mr. Speaker, we understand full well how important it is to Canadians, especially new Canadians, to be able to exercise their democratic right to vote. However, our government is opposed to Canada being used as an electoral constituency by a foreign country. \lineBreak However, we wholeheartedly support Tunisia's democratic transition, as we have from the outset."
587,"Mr. Speaker, millions of dollars have been spent on personal travel by the former Governor General and the Chief of the Defence Staff for their vacations, by the defence minister for a fishing trip and by the  \lineBreak Given so much wasteful spending, is the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said, we have been very prudent in the use of government aircraft. If we compare, for example, what happened under the Liberal Party when the typical use of a Challenger for cabinet ministers was 153 flights a year, we are looking at about 24 or 25 flights in a year, a significant reduction. \lineBreak That being said, in the process of our deficit reduction action plan, we are looking at all options for savings because we want to see the taxpayer dollars treated with respect. We do not want to see waste in any aspect of government."
588,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the  \lineBreak I know he has returned from Washington and from other discussions about the international situation. It seems pretty clear in listening to the debate and discussion that many, including the president of the IMF herself and others, have talked about the risk of too much austerity at a time when there is a genuine and real risk of a deep recession taking hold not only in Europe but across the developed world.  \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, our government continues to be focused on jobs and the economy. The world economic situation is fragile. We are seeing some weakening of global economic growth. Canada, of course, is relatively well positioned. Our economic fundamentals are strong. Our fiscal fundamentals are strong. In fact, we are the envy of most of the other countries in the G7 and for that matter in the G20. \lineBreak Having said that, at the G20 summit in Toronto, the leaders agreed that we would carefully calibrate what needs to be done by individual countries."
589,"Mr. Speaker, I am trying to understand exactly what the  \lineBreak Clearly, Canada, like the United States and Europe, is not immune to these problems. The president of the International Monetary Fund spoke clearly about the danger of excessive restraint. The Bank of Montreal economist said the same thing: we must not smother economic growth. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, it is just the opposite, of course. There are a number of initiatives that our government is involved in with the public sector and private sector in Canada now. We continue work sharing. We have a new hiring credit for small business. I hope that the opposition parties, including the third party, would support these initiatives in the second budget implementation bill. We are continuing with our tax reductions which stimulate the creation of jobs in Canada. \lineBreak Having said all of that, different countries will respond in their unique circumstances. We will be flexible and pragmatic in Canada."
590,"Mr. Speaker, instead of just exporting raw, unprocessed resources, when it comes to the economy, the  \lineBreak  When will the government practise what it preaches and take real action to create Canadian jobs? Where is the jobs plan?","Mr. Speaker, I am afraid the member opposite was not listening last week. I think more than once last week we reminded the opposition that more than 600,000 net new jobs have been created in Canada since the recession ended. This is the best job creation record in the G7.  \lineBreak We need to continue to work on the unemployment problem in Canada, of course. We want to make sure as many people as possible are employed in Canada. I welcome any suggestions the member opposite has."
591,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives do not understand the real need to take action on the economy to help people. Even the Governor of the Bank of Canada recently declared that the government could improve the situation with strategic investments. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, the economic action plan has been very successful so far. We are into its second phase in job creation in Canada. \lineBreak It is important to maintain strong fiscal fundamentals in our country. We see, from other countries in Europe now, the danger of accumulating deficits and large public debt. \lineBreak One of the members of this House was in agreement on that point. She said that we know the situation in Canada is very different from that in the United States, that out debt to GDP ratio is the best in the G7 and that we do not have a debt crisis in Canada. Who said that? It was the member for "
592,"Mr. Speaker, last week, Canada's stock index plummeted 7.5%. That number represents billions of dollars in lost retirement savings for millions of everyday Canadians and yet there has been no action from the government to help ensure Canadians can plan for their retirement. \lineBreak In a time of declining markets, will this out-of-touch government keep insisting that we roll the dice on more private pension plans or will it finally take real action to strengthen Canada's secure public pensions?","Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to actually tell the hon. member what we have done for retirement income for seniors. We have actually cut their taxes by $2 billion, that is one benefit, through pension income splitting. I believe the NDP voted against that. \lineBreak We have been consulting with Canadians. We have been consulting with our partners, the provinces. We have come up with a pooled registered pension plan that will actually provide a pension for millions of Canadians who now do not have one."
593,"Mr. Speaker, the government's half-baked pooled registered pension scheme is not good enough. \lineBreak The government is simply insisting that hard-hit Canadians double down on the same private plans that have failed so many. What Canadians and provincial leaders are asking for is some basic retirement security. \lineBreak When will the out-of-touch government stop gambling with Canadians' retirement? When will it increase the stable guaranteed CPP, QPP benefits that people can actually rely on?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind that hon. member that we have partners in this and those partners are the provinces and territories. \lineBreak I spent this summer consulting with them. In fact, they do agree with us about a pooled registered pension plan to provide pensions to the 60% of Canadians who do not have a workplace pension plan at all. We think that is an incredible amount of people we can help. The pooled registered pension plan is a plan that will actually provide a pension for those folks to help them in their retirement. The provinces are onside."
594,"Mr. Speaker, the Champlain Bridge, the busiest bridge in Canada, has reached the end of its life. If it were to close, Montreal's economy would lose some $740 million a year. That would mean $740 million less for the Quebec and Canadian economies. That figure is from a Federal Bridge Corporation report dated January 2011. \lineBreak Why did the Conservatives hide that report for nine months? Why are the Conservatives jeopardizing the Canadian economy and especially Montreal's economy? ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the hon. member for his question and his interest in the Champlain Bridge. \lineBreak First of all, our government has invested resources in order to ensure that the Champlain Bridge stays open and is safe. We will continue working hard to improve infrastructure in Montreal and across the country. However, I would like to know why the hon. member voted against the investments that are keeping that bridge open."
595,"Mr. Speaker, climate change is not going away just because the government is cutting science. \lineBreak Canada is currently projected to reduce emissions by one-quarter of what is needed to meet its 2020 target. A government that leads instead of follows would have a plan in place for the remaining 75%. \lineBreak Why is the government failing to take any moral responsibility for our children's future?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that we do have a comprehensive plan to meet our 2020 targets of reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 17% from 2005 base levels. We started with the two largest emitting sectors, transportation and now coal-fired electricity, and we will, with the assistance of the provinces and territories, continue to regulate other heavy emitters."
596,"Mr. Speaker, sustainable development of Canada's energy sector is key to our future but the government has failed to show any leadership. What the Conservatives do not understand is that it is impossible to have a strong economy without a strong environment. \lineBreak With today's protest in Ottawa on the government's lack of leadership, when will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is concentrating on what is important to Canadians and that is jobs and economic growth. He made reference to the oil sands. As I mentioned, the oil sands are responsible for jobs right across this country. As we are working with industry and Canadians to build our economy, we are also ensuring we are taking care of the environment at the same time."
597,"Mr. Speaker, we just do not see that. Canada needs an energy strategy that recognizes that the economy, energy and the environment are all important. The government does not seem to understand that a strong economy depends on a healthy environment. \lineBreak In light of the demonstrations taking place on the Hill today, when will the government come up with a sustainable energy strategy for Canada's future?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, our government's focus is on jobs and the economy, and the energy sector, of course, is key to Canada's economic future. It employs hundreds of thousands of Canadians across the country.  \lineBreak The collaborative approach we have taken with the provincial governments is working. It is helping to ensure that our resources are developed in a responsible manner. We are going to work with the provinces to improve regulations and diversify the marketplace. We look forward to a good relationship with them in the future as we have had in the past."
598,"Mr. Speaker, first we have the misuse of DND resources for fishing trips and lobsterfests and now we see the  \lineBreak This past weekend, the Minister of National Defence told the Halifax  \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, the member is wrong. I have nothing but the highest confidence in the military leadership on down through the ranks. They are doing outstanding work for us internationally with 16 different missions around the world, here at home and abroad. I continue to have the utmost confidence in all the men and women who wear the uniform of the Canadian Forces."
599,"Mr. Speaker, it has also been reported that the Department of National Defence is losing public affairs officers because Conservative political staff are berating those in uniform and pushing them to keep a lid on bad news stories.  \lineBreak Why is the minister and the ","Again, Mr. Speaker, the member is wrong. He is using hyperbole. What we have are public affairs practitioners in the Canadian Forces who are in high demand. Clearly, leaving the military at a 20-year mark, especially after they have clearly established marketable and transferrable skills, is common. It is common in all departments. It is common in demographics throughout the Government of Canada. These are people who we value. Members of the public service in Canada are working very hard in every department."
600,"Mr. Speaker, the revelations about staff cuts in the office of the Minister of Defence by the Prime Minister's Office indicate that the  \lineBreak Is this due to the use of military resources for a fishing trip, or to attend a lobster festival? \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said last week, I spent some time in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2010. At that time, I cut my vacation short to take part in government business. As a result of that trip, we have now confirmed that the military has said publicly that I took part in a previously planned search and rescue demonstration. Government assets are used for government business and that is what happened in this instance."
601,"Mr. Speaker, a number of leaks to the media indicate that there are major problems at the Department of National Defence. \lineBreak The departure of a large number of public affairs officers over the past two years due to political interference and micromanagement by the Prime Minister's Office indicates that there is a deep malaise. \lineBreak Is the mass exodus from DND related to this interference? Does the ","Mr. Speaker, we have had an extremely high tempo of operations in the Canadian Forces over the past number of years, which also applies to the public servants, which is the civilian side of the department. As a result, many of the public affairs practitioners are in very high demand in the private sector and some have chosen to take positions in the private sector. We are grateful for their service. \lineBreak As to leaks, leaks are usually as reliable as the courage of the individuals who come forward behind them."
602,"Mr. Speaker, last week  \lineBreak Brave Polish citizens were the victims of Nazi occupiers and not the perpetrators of their evil crimes. \lineBreak The reference in the  \lineBreak Could the minister update the House on what our government has done to correct the offensive misconception about the existence of Polish concentration camps?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising this important and sensitive matter.  \lineBreak He is absolutely right that it is offensive to the memory of so many Poles who fought the Nazi occupation and invasion and who have been declared Righteous Among the Gentiles to refer to Nazi concentration camps as being Polish ones. \lineBreak That is why the Government of Canada has supported at UNESCO the official designation of the Nazi German concentration and extermination camps in occupied Poland. \lineBreak Let there be no mistake about this point in history. The Government of Canada certainly asks that all people be sensitive to the legitimate historic concerns of the Polish community in this regard. "
603,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's national public broadcaster has been increasingly underfunded under the government's watch. Since 2006, funding for the CBC has dropped to an all-time low.  \lineBreak The government is responsible for the slow silencing of Canada's only national voice. From deceptive propaganda campaigns to petitions circulated by Conservative members for its complete defunding, the government's plans for our public broadcaster are clear. \lineBreak Will the Conservative government end its anti-Canadian venture and come out in clear support of the CBC and provide true and stable funding for this Canadian institution?","Mr. Speaker, if that question does not point out how out of touch the NDP members are with taxes and spending, I do not know what does. \lineBreak The NDP members say that CBC is grossly underfunded, but $1 billion is a lot of money. The CBC is receiving a lot of money from taxpayers. We have ensured that the CBC is accountable to taxpayers by ensuring that access to information applies to the CBC. \lineBreak However, we also made a commitment to Canadians that we will balance the budget by 2015, and CBC will do its part."
604,"Mr. Speaker, the important achievements of the CBC in its 75-year history have proven its worth. The CBC contributes to Canadians' feeling of belonging. It is an important institution to Canadians from coast to coast. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives stop attacking the CBC and finally support the only truly national broadcaster?","Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. We will keep the promise we made to taxpayers to have a balanced budget by 2015. Therefore, we will ask everyone—all departments and all crown corporations—to come up with ways of finding the amounts needed to balance the budget by 2015. The CBC will do its share; that is certain. We are working with the corporation to find these amounts, and it will do its share to achieve a balanced budget by 2015."
605,"Mr. Speaker, the government has its priorities backward. It claims to be worried about crime, but it is cutting back the Canada Border Service Agency in Windsor itself, one of the busiest border crossings and a favourite route for gun and drug smugglers to go through. \lineBreak How can this be about saving money when the government diverts millions of dollars of border money and infrastructure money into a G8 slush fund? \lineBreak When will the Conservatives see reason, put public safety first, rescind these cuts and put Canadians' interests instead of their own interests forward? ","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian people have given this government a strong mandate to keep our streets safe, and that includes our borders. We are doing that by investing, we are doing that by ensuring that criminals receive minimum times for the crimes they commit. \lineBreak We ask the NDP to get on board and support our crime measures, which include protecting our borders."
606,"Mr. Speaker, the last first ministers' meeting on health care was in 2005, a year after the signing of the 2004 health accord. Since then, every report tracking the accord's progress cites lack of federal leadership for failure to achieve important goals. \lineBreak The provinces, the Canadian Medical Association, the Wait Time Alliance and the Canadian Public Health Association all urge the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, since forming government, we have been supporting the provinces and the territories with the rollout of the present accord, which expires in 2014. We are committed to extending the 6% annual increase in transfer payments to the provinces and the territories while we negotiate the accord, but it is also important that the federal moneys sent to them are also improving the health outcomes of Canadians."
607,"Mr. Speaker, while the suicide rate in Canada has declined in recent years, in the aboriginal communities it remains tragically high. The most alarming statistic is the rate of suicide among young aboriginals, which is five to six times higher than for other Canadians. They have no recreational activities, no youth centres, no extracurricular programs and no hope. \lineBreak When will this government finally take action to support young aboriginals and young Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, too many Canadians have to deal with the anguish of losing a loved one. That is why our government is funding programs that build on the strength of protective factors, such as ensuring family and community support systems are in place. \lineBreak In budget 2010 our government invested $65 million to implement the national aboriginal youth suicide prevention strategy to assist over 150 community-based projects across Canada."
608,"Mr. Speaker, sadly, over the weekend a young person living in Cross Lake, Manitoba, took his own life, the second in as many weeks. His community has been asking for federal support for youth programming for a long time. Young people are still waiting. \lineBreak Instead of talking about out-of-control youth, when will the government stand up and support young people in aboriginal communities so that they can gain control over their lives? When will the government act to put an end to the high suicide rates among Canada's aboriginal people and stand up for Canada's young people?","Mr. Speaker, we have recognized that there are issues with our first nations communities. That is why we entered into a joint action plan with the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. We are working on four major pillars, including education and economic development.  \lineBreak These are ways that we can work with willing partners to boost the health and prosperity of our first nations communities. We are investing in the right areas and we will plan to continue to do so."
609,"Mr. Speaker, today the  \lineBreak Our government's top priority remains completing the economic recovery. That is why Canadians gave our Conservative government a strong mandate to stay focused on what matters: creating jobs and economic growth. \lineBreak Could the dynamic and hard-working ","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for  \lineBreak The agreement he refers to will encourage two-way trade and investment by providing certainty and predictability for investors. This will in turn create jobs and economic growth for Canadian workers and their families. Canadians intuitively understand that expanded trade is key to their long-term prosperity.  \lineBreak We will continue to take measures that broaden and deepen our trading relationships. It is too bad the opposition parties do not agree."
610,"Mr. Speaker, the government has broken a promise it made to the Afghans who risked their lives alongside the Canadian Forces. The special immigration program ended this month. It was a program that was supposed to allow Afghan interpreters to live in safety in Canada. Two out of every three applications were denied. \lineBreak Can the minister responsible explain why this program was not changed in order to achieve its objective?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is mistaken. \lineBreak Indeed, no commitment was made to the interpreters who worked with the Canadian Forces or with our international development agency in Kandahar. Three years ago we introduced a discretionary program, which included certain parameters to ensure that the applicants were qualified to come to Canada as permanent residents. The initial estimate was roughly 400 to 500 people and we will exceed that objective by welcoming more than 500 former Afghan interpreters to Canada."
611,"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to natural resources, the government only cares about short-term profit. \lineBreak By way of evidence, the  \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, our government is concentrating on what is important to Canadians, and that is jobs and economic growth. As I mentioned before, the oil sands and their development are responsible right now for almost 400,000 jobs across this country. That is in every area and region of this country, and that number is expected to grow. That is how many jobs the opposition says “no” to when it bashes the oil sands. \lineBreak  We know the importance of getting the environmental challenges right. That is why we are investing in new technology. We are working with industry and the provinces to ensure the environment is protected as the economy grows."
612,"Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, arising out of question period, the hon. member for  \lineBreak I do not want to attribute motives, but it would appear that what the member for  \lineBreak Now it seems to be a case of mixed members or perhaps mistaken identity. I would like to give the member for  \lineBreak I know the member would not want to leave any other impression, other than the correct one, before the House.","Mr. Speaker, if the member was misquoted by me, I certainly apologize and take it back."
613,"Mr. Speaker, it would certainly be a refreshing change. \lineBreak I would like to ask a question of the  \lineBreak Mr. Speaker, what is not clear is that we have a policy with respect to sustainability. Could the minister tell us, why is it that the government has failed to develop a coherent approach on climate change, on the reduction of greenhouse gases and on producing a truly sustainable policy?","Mr. Speaker, I assure my hon. colleague that cleaner air, cleaner water and active stewardship of our great natural spaces remain key priorities of this government, even in times of fiscal restraint. \lineBreak I would inform my colleague that according to the World Health Organization, Canada ranks third in the world in terms of air quality. This is something all Canadians can take pride in. We take pride in our regulatory approach to greenhouse gases. We are moving forward sector by sector."
614,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Will the government listen to Canadians and think before saying yes to Keystone?","Mr. Speaker, we know that the oil sands are a proven strategic resource for Canada and that they provide jobs right across the country. The Keystone XL pipeline is going to contribute to job creation and energy security both here and in the United States. \lineBreak Our government is going to continue to promote the oil sands as a stable, secure and ethical source of energy for the world."
615,"Mr. Speaker, it is really disappointing to hear that the government has one set of rules for its oil industry friends and another set of rules for the rest of us. How else can the minister justify a project that adds more greenhouse gas emissions to the oil sands, which are already growing so fast they are overwhelming any emission savings coming from other sectors? Why the double standard? \lineBreak When will the minister finally stand up for Canadians and say no to this misguided project?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP members should stop taking the side of the extremists who want to kill Canadian jobs. They have made it clear they want to shutter new development of the oil sands. They are willing to destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country.  \lineBreak They can go outside and join with those dozens of protestors, but we are going to stand with the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who depend on the oil sands."
616,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians want sustainable livelihoods for themselves and their children, not a mass export pipeline that will pour away the benefits of our natural resources while leaving us with the environmental tab. The government is out of touch with the realities facing Canadian workers. Why is the minister selling out Canadians' jobs at the expense of our environment?","Mr. Speaker, let me talk a little about jobs. The oil sands development supports right now 130,000 direct jobs. It supports 390,000 jobs across Canada today. By 2020 that number will rise to 480,000, and if the Keystone XL pipeline is approved, with the extra product that will be shipped through there, the number will rise to 620,000 jobs.  \lineBreak Why is the NDP opposed to that kind of job development?"
617,"Mr. Speaker, under this government, the National Energy Board has never worried about creating jobs in our country before approving the pipeline project. It is as though it does not think jobs in Canada are in the public interest. \lineBreak Will the minister protect Canadian jobs by ordering the National Energy Board to assess the impact of the Keystone XL pipeline on Canadian workers?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the member heard the last answer. Let me repeat that right now there are 130,000 direct jobs that are tied to oil sands development. There are 390,000 people across the country who rely on the oil sands and the development of them for their jobs. The number will rise to 620,000 jobs if the Keystone XL pipeline is approved.  \lineBreak Why does the NDP oppose that? It should get on board and support us as we move ahead, promote the economy and support economic recovery in this country."
618,"Mr. Speaker, arising from question period, my point of order is about a mission that I went on where I joined the armed forces on a pre-planned search and rescue mission. I know exactly what happened there. It was an exercise off the coast of Fogo Island, as well as inland. \lineBreak  The minister did say, though, in his answer that it cost $160,000 for five hours, which basically comes down to $32,000 per hour. When we said to the former parliamentary secretary that it was $32,000, he said that number was nonsense. \lineBreak I would like for the minister and the former parliamentary secretary to get together and provide information to the House about what exactly the number is.","That seems to be a continuation of debate. If the member wishes, he can take it up at the next question period."
619,"Mr. Speaker, members on this side of the House have been asking questions of the  \lineBreak Will the minister, as part of the government that rode into power on the white horse of accountability and also as a former member of a provincial government that wreaked havoc on Ontario's books, finally stand in his place and explain his actions to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians would like to concentrate on some good news. \lineBreak  Let us listen to what the best  \lineBreak Let us see what the best  \lineBreak Let us see what the best "
620,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian voters did not give the Conservatives a mandate to cut off the front-line services that protect our streets every single day. \lineBreak They are also slashing 73 Service Canada jobs in Windsor alone. These folks process employment insurance requests from across the country and just won a national service award. \lineBreak How does the Conservative member reward them? He actually gave them a pink slip and showed them the door. It is unacceptable.  \lineBreak What we have right now is money in the millions for consultants, pet projects and joyrides in jets, but cutbacks for those who help the unemployed. It is unacceptable and it has to be reversed.","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to complete Canada's economic recovery and return to balanced budgets. Improving the way we deliver EI services to Canadians by modernizing is one way in which we will accomplish that goal. There are no Service Canada offices closing and no impact on in-person services offered. At this time it is premature to speculate on any specific impacts to any employees.  \lineBreak Our government is committed to effective and efficient use of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars."
621,"Mr. Speaker, in his Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State, the  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, this government has established rules and these rules are enforced. I think that the Leader of the Opposition is talking about a specific situation. The minister responsible has answered questions a number of times in the House of Commons."
622,"Mr. Speaker, asbestos is the greatest industrial killer that the world has ever known, yet this country continues to export nearly 200,000 tonnes per year into underdeveloped nations that have virtually no health and safety protocols. \lineBreak Instead of shovelling even more corporate welfare into this made-in-Canada epidemic, why does the government not use that money for economic diversification for the asbestos region of Quebec to get it out of this deadly and dying industry?","Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, Canada has been arguing for the safe and controlled use of chrysotile at home and abroad and recent scientific studies clearly confirm that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment."
623,"Mr. Speaker, let us try again and see if we get anything new. \lineBreak This government claims to want to create jobs by supporting the asbestos industry. In reality, it is exporting disease and death to countries that have inadequate labour health and safety standards. This position does not help the communities that are relying on a dying industry. The workers have suffered enough. \lineBreak What is this government waiting for to show real respect for these people and to develop with them a transition plan to stimulate the economy in that region?","Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, Canada has been arguing for the safe and controlled use of chrysotile at home and abroad, and recent scientific studies clearly confirm that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment."
624,"Mr. Speaker, more tax giveaways to big oil companies do not create jobs. What does create jobs is infrastructure. Almost 60% of Montrealers are scared to drive because of crumbling concrete. Yesterday, a motion to replace the Champlain Bridge was rejected by the Conservative government. Muskoka got a $50 million slush fund, but other communities are being denied the basics. Why?","Mr. Speaker, my experience in municipal politics has taught me that municipalities have not in the past had a more committed partner than our Conservative government, led by this  \lineBreak It was our government that launched the building Canada fund and we will continue to deliver for municipalities. "
625,"Mr. Speaker, I was talking about an infrastructure plan, like the Champlain Bridge, that right now costs $30 million a year just to maintain. Cities across Canada need new bridges, new rail lines, sewage treatment plants, and other critically important projects. Investing in infrastructure makes sense.  \lineBreak We have seen the government reward its well-connected friends. When will it protect Canadians by investing in basic infrastructure?","Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague already knows, we will have a new infrastructure plan after 2014. That is why we trust our infrastructure investments. That is why, in the economic action plan, we invested more than ever in infrastructure. I do not understand why members of the NDP are saying that today and yet they voted against it when we set it up. "
626,"Mr. Speaker, we know that closing the Champlain Bridge would result in annual losses of $740 million. We know that the bridge must be replaced immediately to ensure the safety of Quebeckers and the health of the Canadian economy. \lineBreak Yesterday, we moved a motion proposing that the Champlain Bridge be replaced. The Conservatives rejected the motion outright. They said no to the economy and to safety. \lineBreak Why did they reject the motion? When will this government take action and build a new bridge?","Mr. Speaker, while my colleague talks about closing the Champlain Bridge, we are investing $380 million to ensure that it is safe and will continue to be operational for a long time. While the member moves motions, we are working to ensure that the people of Montreal will have a safe bridge that is in good working order for a long time to come."
627,"Mr. Speaker, the government is out of touch with the reality of Canadians when it comes to the safety of our communities. The Conservatives are playing politics with their omnibus bill on crime but they are not even aware of the cost. The job of parliamentarians is to study and debate bills but the Conservatives refuse to do so. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives refusing to work with the NDP to improve the safety of our communities and protect our youth and the rights of victims?","Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the NDP always objects to spending money when it comes to fighting violent crime. Now when it comes to spending money and threatening jail time for people who do not fill out the census, the NDP does not have a problem with that, or for farmers who do not like the Wheat Board, or those who do not agree with the long gun registry. \lineBreak I am proud to be part of a party that knows where money should be spent and that is to go after violent criminals in this country, and he should be supporting that."
628,"Mr. Speaker, we have heard repeatedly, and again just now, about the cost to victims but the government will not produce any evidence of that to this Parliament. That is exactly why we need to continue the study around these claims. The Conservatives are wrong to shut down debate on a bill which we have spent less than four minutes a page debating. \lineBreak Later today, the NDP will propose fast-tracking parts of this bill; for example, parts that protect children from sexual abuse, that have already passed this Parliament once before and then proceed with a constructive debate on the rest. Will the government agree to that strategy?","Mr. Speaker, we offered to do that before, but then we got a majority and now the NDP has withdrawn that. Now he is saying that we are to leave out the part that goes after drug dealers, the people who bring drugs into this country, the people who sell drugs around schools. Nobody is going to agree to that. Let us get the whole thing passed. That is what Canadians want."
629,"Mr. Speaker, the justice minister has been silent on the cost to taxpayers of the government's massive crime bill. This is the same government that, in the last Parliament, refused to provide information to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, so he could report to Canadians how much those crime bills would cost. \lineBreak  Are the Conservatives shutting down debate because they do not want Canadians to know the facts? When will the Conservatives come clean and release the real cost of this bill?","Mr. Speaker, let me tell members who has been silent. It is the NDP on the cost to victims in this country. We never hear a question about that coming from the NDP and, to be fair, the Liberals as well. They are in on that. \lineBreak The Department of Justice estimated the cost of crime in this country is about $99 billion, of which 83% is borne by victims. If the hon. member is worried about the costs, he should start standing up for victims, just to make a change for the NDP."
630,"Mr. Speaker, I want to tell that side of the House that crime is not a political wedge issue. We believe it is a public safety issue. Once again, Conservatives refuse to answer a direct question. Canadians deserve an answer. Millions of out of work Canadians want their government to invest in job plans, not in doubling the prison budget. \lineBreak Why does the government hide behind its overused talking points instead of just telling Canadians what the real cost is of this crime bill?","Mr. Speaker, this is an investment to better protect Canadians in their homes and make them feel safer in their communities. I appreciate that is not a priority for the NDP. If members want detailed costs, look at the hundreds of pages that we tabled before the committee. That will give many hours of happy reading for NDP members, but I have a feeling that it will not convince them to start standing up for victims and law-abiding Canadians."
631,"Mr. Speaker, our government is certainly focused on jobs and the economy. We are helping to put Canadians back to work as evidenced by the 600,000 new jobs created since July 2009. However, the opposition has another agenda that will destroy Canadian jobs and put our country deeply back into a recession. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, the Keystone XL pipeline will create over 140,000 good, high paying jobs in Canada. The NDP has decided to stand against these jobs and ally itself with a few environmental extremists who want to shutter all oil sands development. While the NDP continues to betray its job killing agenda, our government will continue to stand with the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who will benefit from this important project."
632,"Mr. Speaker, last week, the  \lineBreak  If assessing and preventing industrial impacts on our environment are not considered basic services, then can the minister explain what he means by “basic services”?","Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would correct my hon. colleague. The Environmental Assessment Agency has not been cut by 48% and the environment remains a priority of this government even at times of fiscal restraint. As we are doing across government, we will continue to take a close look at all of our spending over the next year and the results of this examination will be revealed in the budget in the spring."
633,"Mr. Speaker, this out-of-touch government seems more concerned with American unemployment than Canadian jobs. Why else would it ignore environmental concerns on both sides of the border and ship raw bitumen on the Keystone pipeline to the Gulf coast? \lineBreak We all know it is not just oil sands bitumen that will flow through that pipeline. It is good paying Canadian jobs.  \lineBreak Will this out-of-touch government come clean about what the Keystone pipeline really means to Canadian families: a loss of good paying Canadian jobs?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP talking about jobs and the oil sands is frankly ridiculous. The NDP's former environment critic called for a moratorium on oil sands development. The Keystone XL pipeline will create over 140,000 jobs and $600 billion in economic activity. That is what the NDP is prepared to kill."
634,"Mr. Speaker, the government is not doing anything to protect Canadians' jobs in the Keystone XL project. Thousands of well-paying, quality jobs will be transferred to the United States should the project go ahead. According to a study conducted by Informetrica, tens of thousands of Canadian jobs are at stake. \lineBreak Why is this government sacrificing thousands of Canadian jobs for the sake of its relationship with the oil companies?","Mr. Speaker, the fact is that oil sands development generates over 500,000 jobs and the Keystone project will generate over 140,000 jobs across Canada. \lineBreak It is also interesting to note how the NDP does not really understand that there is no refinery capacity in Alberta. There is in Texas. It would cost over $16 billion to create refineries, rendering it uneconomical."
635,"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to defending Canadians against U.S. protectionism, the government has failed consistently. \lineBreak DFAIT officials before a committee admitted that the government had failed to take pre-emptive action against buy American, even though President Obama has been stating made in America for months. \lineBreak The WTO found United States country of origin labelling is a trade violation and yet the government makes excuses. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, it was actually the Liberal Party that slept through 13 long years on the trade file.  \lineBreak It was the WTO that recently pointed out that Canada's considerably expanded free trade agreement agenda marks a departure with its past practice. What practice are we referring to? It is the practice of the previous Liberal government."
636,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government falls short every time it is faced with American protectionism. When the United States announced its Buy American initiative in 2009, it took the Conservatives seven months to react. According to the WTO, country-of-origin labelling violates trade laws. Nevertheless, the government continues to insist that the United States is negotiating in good faith. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives realize that they have to fight American protectionism, not excuse it?","Mr. Speaker, we have stated time and again that trade is critical to Canada's long-term prosperity. We have been working very hard to impress upon our American neighbours that protectionism hurts not only Canadians, but it hurts Americans. It takes away jobs and it takes away the robustness of global trade. \lineBreak We will continue to stand up for hard-working Canadians and businesses. Why will the Liberal Party not do so?"
637,"Mr. Speaker, this government's research and development policy is pathetic, and a recent report has confirmed that. Canada ranks last among industrialized countries in terms of direct funding for research. It ranks second-last in terms of patent development and second-last in terms of the number of PhD graduates. What a failure. \lineBreak Will this government review its research and development policies to create the jobs that our economy and Canadian families so desperately need?","Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of that question. In fact, no government in the history of our country has put so much investment into science and technology. In fact, the brain drain that we knew about years and years ago under the Liberals has been reversed under this government. \lineBreak We now have more fellowships, more internships, more Canada excellence research chairs and more Canada research chairs. We have funding for buildings and equipment. \lineBreak That is under this "
638,"Mr. Speaker, it would be great if it were true but it simply is not. \lineBreak On this side of the House, we believe in innovation, but let us see the record on the other side. We see that direct public investment in R & D is in last place in the industrialized world. Patent development is second to last. PhD graduates are second to last. That is the record of the government. It is clear that the government does not have a plan. \lineBreak  When will the government stop endangering our economy and start investing in research and development to create jobs here in Canada for Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, first, productivity and innovation have been declining for decades, which is exactly why the  \lineBreak It is true that businesses are not doing enough, which is exactly why, if the member were paying attention, we launched a panel review into the R and  D sectors and our platform of programs. That panel will report in a couple of weeks. The hon. member should stay tuned."
639,"Mr. Speaker, today, the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics passed an important motion to investigate the questionable influence of big unions on the NDP.  \lineBreak Last week, it was revealed that the NDP received at least $85,000 from big labour unions for their convention even though such donations were banned in 2005.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, this type of behaviour on behalf of the NDP is entirely unacceptable. The Elections Canada Act clearly indicates that corporate and union donations are not allowed. Political parties are required to raise money through donations from ordinary everyday Canadians. Elections Canada has been asked to investigate these sponsorships.  \lineBreak The NDP and its union friends do not need to wait for that. They can come clean with Canadians today. We do not need to go to the ethics committee. They could come clean and tell Canadians today but they are not doing it."
640,"Mr. Speaker, in February, the Conservatives gave a $75,000 accessibility grant to the Ontario Cornerstone Leadership Corporation, a front for the Ontario NDP, to install a wheelchair lift in its inaccessible party headquarters. The rules required that construction was to begin six months ago and be completed two months ago. It is obvious to anyone who walks up to the building that the project has not even started. \lineBreak Where did the money go? If the money was improperly spent, will the government demand that the money be returned to the taxpayer?","Mr. Speaker, no government has done more for Canadians with disabilities than our Conservative government. Their full participation in our economy and communities is vital to our country's success. Supporting Canadians of all abilities through the economic action plan helped create opportunities for people who otherwise would not have had them.  \lineBreak We are very proud of this program and, to date, we have supported over 600 worthy community-based projects across the country. Budget 2010 provided an additional $45 million over the next three years and will expand this program for mid-sized projects. We are doing what we need to do for Canadians with disabilities."
641,"Mr. Speaker, Canadian university graduates are being shut out of the job market at an alarming rate. A whopping one in five grads wind up with jobs on the low end of the income scale. That is more than any other OECD country. Instead of helping strengthen our economy with their degrees and skills, they are being wasted.  \lineBreak When will the government stop the inaction and come forward with a real jobs plan with real opportunities for Canadian graduates?","Mr. Speaker, we have a plan to support jobs and growth. It is the second phase of the economic action plan. It includes the small business tax credit, which is very important, and I hope members opposite will choose to support that. \lineBreak  The NDP and the Liberals voted against $1 billion in federal funding to the provinces and territories for infrastructure in 2011-12. The opposition also voted against the accelerated capital cost allowance, which would have continued over the past two years. I hope the voting behaviour will match the rhetoric."
642,"Mr. Speaker, recent statistics have shown us that the number of people smoking in this country is at historic lows. Our government takes the health and safety of Canadians seriously and we will continue our diligent work, not only to encourage more and more people to quite smoking but also to discourage young Canadians from starting this bad habit in the first place.  \lineBreak Today, the ","Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for  \lineBreak Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to continue efforts aimed at keeping our citizens healthy. Today we announced new warnings for tobacco products. The 16 new warnings cover 75% of the front and back of cigarette and little cigar packages, with eight health information messages and four toxic emission statements on the sides of the packages.  \lineBreak Our government wants to sensitize Canadians to the health challenges posed by tobacco products and we will continue to act in order to protect Canadians' health and keep our children safe."
643,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's Asia-Pacific gateway should be about more than the Conservative strategy of just shipping our raw materials overseas. \lineBreak  Last week, the president of the Asia Pacific Foundation advised the government that to be successful in expanding our trade, Canada needed to invest in human capacity building. This means investing in better language education, better training in cross-cultural communication and more support for international business education. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives just shipping away Canadian raw materials and jobs instead of making the smart investments in Canadians that will build a foundation for expanding our trade with the region?","Mr. Speaker, the Asia-Pacific gateway is critical to Canada's long-term economic prosperity. As the demand for Canadian exports to the Asia-Pacific markets continue to grow so do the opportunities for Canadian workers and companies. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the Asia-Pacific markets so we can create economic growth, more jobs and financial security for all Canadians. "
644,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon.  \lineBreak On top of recent cuts at Environment Canada, we are aware now that the whole glaciology group at Natural Resources Canada is being disbanded and dismantled. Eighty thousand years worth of climate record in the ice cores may disappear from Canadian possession. \lineBreak I would like to ask the minister if he would please reconsider and ensure that this essential science is protected and that Canada continues its world record-breaking work in this key and core area of science?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is misinformed. There will be no destruction of the ice cores. In fact, having provided the useful scientific input at NRCan, they will be transferred to universities where the research can continue."
645,"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The other day in the House of Commons I raised a question and stated, “In Alberta, Jonathan Denis, the housing minister, now says that Alberta will pick up the slack where the federal government has failed”.  \lineBreak I wish to correct the record. I read the story in a media release and I verified it. He did not actually say that he would “pick up the slack”. He did say, “It didn’t sit well with me that someone who’s put their life on the line for our country was homeless”, noting no one should be homeless, but this particular case hit him hard. Further on in the media release he stated that he wanted to assist those homeless veterans. \lineBreak Even though I personally believe that issues involving veterans are federal issues, I am proud to say that the Alberta government and other governments are doing something to help these veterans.  \lineBreak I did quote Mr. Denis incorrectly and I wish to apologize to him and correct the record.",The House appreciates that. 
646,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Will we have a job plan tomorrow?","Mr. Speaker, this government is continuing with a plan that has been a big success. That is why Canada has created many more jobs than the vast majority of industrialized countries. Obviously, we reject the NDP's proposals to increase taxes and shut down key industries in the Canadian economy. Such proposals would kill employment and this government will never agree to those kinds of NDP proposals."
647,"Mr. Speaker, the consensus among economists and business gurus is that the Canadian economy will slow down. We are facing another recession. \lineBreak The chief economist for BMO Nesbitt Burns compares the  \lineBreak Why will the ","Mr. Speaker, the government's plans are oriented toward job creation, which is why Canada has one of the best job creation records in the entire industrialized world. That is the path we will continue to pursue. \lineBreak We seek, obviously, any useful ideas from the opposition on how we can improve Canada's performance, but we will tell you that what they have proposed lately, raising taxes and shutting down key industries, are not proposals that will create jobs and not proposals that this government will ever accept."
648,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' failure to act has proven to be an economic disaster for young workers. Today there are 110,000 fewer jobs for young people than before the recession, and the unemployment rate is over 14%, not counting the thousands of young people who abandoned the labour market and are now on social assistance or living on the street. Canada cannot deprive itself of its talented youth. \lineBreak Where is the Conservatives' plan to put our young people back to work?","Mr. Speaker, in the second phase of Canada's economic action plan there is a hiring credit for the 525,000 small businesses in Canada. I hope that the official opposition will support these measures to help job creation in Canada. \lineBreak We remain focused on the economy and job growth, and I welcome any useful suggestions the member opposite has."
649,"Mr. Speaker, we have seen just how out of touch the government is. Conservatives are boasting about precarious jobs, part-time jobs, jobs that pay just half of what they did before the recession because of Conservative economic mismanagement.  \lineBreak Canada has lost too many good, high-skilled, highly paid manufacturing jobs. TD Bank says these workers, if they can find work, are now paid an average of $10,000 less a year. \lineBreak Where is the Conservative plan to create good jobs. Where is the jobs plan?","Mr. Speaker, the plan is working.  \lineBreak I hear what the member opposite asserts; of course, it is not accurate. We have created about 600,000 net new jobs in the Canadian economy in past couple of years, of which 80% are full-time jobs for Canadians.  \lineBreak This is just the opposite of what the official opposition, the NDP, suggests. What the NDP suggests is a brand new tax increase of $10 billion on Canadian business to kill jobs in the Canadian economy."
650,"Mr. Speaker, Dr. Sherry Cooper of BMO Nesbitt Burns said recently in her newsletter: \lineBreak She goes on to say: \lineBreak I wonder if the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada's economic action plan and Canada's fiscal approach have been praised by observers around the world. \lineBreak It is not as the leader of the Liberal Party would suggest. In fact, we are running a very expansionary fiscal policy right now, but we are obviously undertaking good management and some modest savings to ensure that as the economy recovers, we will in fact balance our budget and retain our fiscal advantage."
651,"Mr. Speaker, the position I just shared is not my personal view. It is the position clearly expressed by Ms. Cooper, and one that is shared by many other observers who see that this government's activities are doing nothing to help economic growth.  \lineBreak We are not asking for a response for us, but rather for those who are talking about the contraction in the United States and in Europe and the problems that exist in Canada. Why can we not get a different answer from the government?","Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of analysts who have examined our plan support our approach. It is a very expansionary approach now, with an expansionary fiscal policy. Clearly, we need to save money in order to achieve a balanced budget once the economy begins to grow again. It is crucial that we retain our fiscal advantage."
652,"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the course of question period today, you made a point of saying that someone could not do indirectly what he or she is not allowed to do directly.  \lineBreak In that context, Mr. Speaker, I wonder if you would take the time to have a look at Standing Order 31 in the name of the member for  \lineBreak  I wonder if you would have a look at the record, Mr. Speaker.",I will examine the transcript and get back to the House if necessary.
653,"Mr. Speaker, the minister, despite being asked multiple times, has still not said what he considers to be a core program, so perhaps the  \lineBreak For the ","Mr. Speaker, as my colleague knows, our government does recognize the burden of cancer and the effect that it has on lives and the families who live with loved ones who have this horrible disease. That is why our government is supporting cancer control and prevention efforts, working with provincial and territorial governments as well as stakeholders from across Canada to reduce the burden of cancer. We are renewing $250 million over five years for the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer to continue its excellent work."
654,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, as I have said repeatedly, we have an economic action plan. That is why we received a mandate from Canadians. Clearly, we are concerned about the developments in Europe and elsewhere, but at the same time, over 600,000 jobs have been created in Canada. That is one of the best records in the industrialized world. That is the path we will continue to take."
655,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at the Standing Committee on Finance, economists said that the  \lineBreak The Prime Minister needs to realize this. He needs to realize that his economic strategy has created a structural deficit, the worst deficit in the history of the country. We are now facing a second recession under his watch. \lineBreak Why does the Prime Minister insist on pursuing this course of action?","Mr. Speaker, this question does not make sense. The hon. member is advocating that we increase the deficit. We want to reduce the deficit. The government's position is clear. We have a major deficit but it is still much smaller than that of other countries, and we will ensure that the budget is balanced while the economy continues to grow."
656,"Mr. Speaker, it is now 111 days since the Muskoka  \lineBreak The minister personally intervened and moved it out of the Muskoka slush fund and said he would get the funding elsewhere. Now the documents show that this gave the three amigos--the mayor, the hotel manager and the minister--a much larger pot of goodies. \lineBreak Will the minister explain why he personally intervened? Will he explain why this project is now the subject of a police investigation?","Mr. Speaker, the facts on this issue have not changed. This has been thoroughly aired.  \lineBreak I say to my friend opposite that of the 32 projects I approved under this initiative, not one involved an arena in Gravenhurst."
657,"Mr. Speaker, who was approving the money then? This is about a minister who misused the taxpayers' dollars, used his BlackBerry to get a friend a job, used his office to run a slush fund, and relied on the  \lineBreak The Gravenhurst project blew the budget. People were fired. The cops were called in. Does the minister think that is an appropriate way to abuse the public trust? It has been 111 days. Will he please stand and take accountability for his actions?","Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. Not one G8 project involved the construction of a hockey arena in the town of Gravenhurst, not one of the 32 projects. I cannot be any clearer than that. The member opposite has the right to his own opinion, but he certainly does not have the right to create his own facts."
658,"Mr. Speaker, speaking in Lima, Peru, in November 2009, the  \lineBreak I would like to ask the  \lineBreak What will it take for the government to change course once again?","Mr. Speaker, the government continues to run a significant deficit, as is appropriate at these times, but we are taking steps to ensure the budget will balance as the economy grows. \lineBreak The difference between our position and the position of the hon. member, especially when he had premier responsibilities, was that no matter what circumstances we have, his position was we always increase the deficit. If times are good, we increase the deficit. If times are bad, we increase the deficit, and in the times in between, we increase the deficit. \lineBreak Obviously, we use a steadier and more prudent judgment in managing the economy."
659,"Mr. Speaker, over the last five years, the government raised spending, on average, by 18%, by $70 billion. The  \lineBreak The question the ","Mr. Speaker, the member gets on his feet to say, “You're spending too much money. Why don't you spend more?” That is the kind of position we have come to anticipate from the member. Of course, this government's economic record has been mandated by the Canadian people and praised by analysts around the world.  \lineBreak Frankly, everybody in this country has the right to lecture the hon. member about how he managed the Ontario economy."
660,"Mr. Speaker, this government, which is out of touch with reality, continues to boast about its record, but its failure to act speaks volumes. The job situation is worse than it is letting on. Since the recession, 200,000 more Canadians do not have jobs. \lineBreak When will this minister stop twisting the figures? When will this out-of-touch government take action and start creating jobs?","Mr. Speaker, the figure is very clear. The figure is 600,000 net new jobs. Those are the jobs that have been created in the Canadian economy since the end of the recession in July 2009. \lineBreak It is also clear, if the member opposite wants to look at the figures in the G7, that is the best job creation rate in the G7 since the end of the recession. \lineBreak Can we do more? Yes. Are we doing more? Yes.  \lineBreak There is a hiring credit for small business. It will be in the budget bill next week. I hope the member opposite votes for it."
661,"Mr. Speaker, the government likes to talk about its job creation record, but the numbers just do not add up, so here are the facts. There are 500,000 more people available for work since the recession. Only half that number of jobs have been recovered. That is one job for every two unemployed people, nothing to brag about. \lineBreak Unemployment is rising. Canadians are tired of talk. When will the government stop spinning the numbers and start taking some real action on job creation?","Mr. Speaker, the member can speak louder, but it is still wrong. There are 600,000 net new jobs, 80% of them full-time jobs in Canada, the best job creation record in the G7.  \lineBreak We anticipate having the strongest growth in the G7 in the next two years. That is what the IMF says and that is what the OECD said, and Moody's has just renewed Canada's top credit rating in the world, triple A."
662,"Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough that the  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I will not get involved in provincial politics. I will get into trouble at home. \lineBreak  We have had substantial job creation across the country, 600,000 net new jobs, and that includes participation of the people of Ontario."
663,"Mr. Speaker, the simple fact is good manufacturing jobs are being lost and the government refuses to act. Mill closures, boarded-up factories, more and more jobs flying overseas. That is the reality for working families in Ontario. \lineBreak New Democrats have long been calling for action. Now even the Ontario Conservative leader sees it is a problem. When will this out-of-touch government finally take real action and create jobs? Where is the jobs plan?","Mr. Speaker, we are following an expansionary economic policy. If we look now at what we are doing in terms of transfers, they continue to increase. Transfers are very important for the provinces for health, education and social services. That is just the opposite of what was done in the mid-90s by the previous Liberal government that cut transfers unilaterally to the provinces. \lineBreak  We are following an expansionary fiscal policy. We are going to return to a balanced budget. We think that is important, and I am sure the member opposite would agree, looking at the trouble that some other countries in the world have gotten into by accumulating substantial deficits over time and building up large public debt."
664,"Mr. Speaker, the scandals involving the President of the Treasury Board keep piling up, while services for Canadians are being cut. People do not understand why there are some rules for his friends and other rules for ordinary people. There is going to be less help available at Service Canada centres, and some are going to close altogether. I am talking about services that directly affect the public and not just his friends.  \lineBreak In the meantime, the minister responsible for the cuts is refusing to answer questions in the House and refusing to talk to journalists. Am I going to have to send my questions to him on Twitter to get him to respond?","Mr. Speaker, there will be no Service Canada offices closing and no impact on in-person services offered. Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to complete Canada's economic recovery, create jobs, and return to balanced budgets. Improving the way we deliver EI services to Canadians by modernizing the way we accomplish this is one of our goals. \lineBreak Our government is committed to effective and efficient use of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars."
665,"Mr. Speaker, this week Canada's first nations kicked off national efforts for first nations education. Their message is simple every first nation child must have equal access to quality education under control of first nations. This was Shannen Koostachin's dream. Evidence shows education is crucial to breaking cycles of poverty and hopelessness. \lineBreak Will the government commit today to end the 2% cap on funding, and provide full and adequate support for first nations education?","Mr. Speaker, we are working with our willing partners to improve the educational outcomes of first nations across the country. \lineBreak That is why the national chief and myself announced the national panel. It is doing good work across the country. It is totally independent. The government has not constrained the panel in any way. Its recommendations should be coming forward in December or January. In the meantime, we will wait to see the good work that it will produce."
666,"Mr. Speaker, most Canadians were profoundly disturbed to learn that the  \lineBreak I do not know how he can look Canadians in the eyes and tell them that he is behaving responsibly. How can the ","Mr. Speaker, Infrastructure Canada approved 32 projects to support the G8 infrastructure under the three categories provided. I approved all 32 of those projects. There was a contribution agreement written up for each of those 32 projects. \lineBreak  The Auditor General has made some helpful comments about what we can do to be more transparent to the House of Commons in the future. We fully accept those recommendations and will follow them in the future."
667,"Mr. Speaker, the minister continues to keep Canadians in the dark about the price tag of his crime bill. It is all about transparency. Yesterday, the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that this bill will cost billions of dollars, yet this government still will not explain its impact on the country's future. \lineBreak How can this government be so irresponsible as to force the passage of a bill without disclosing how much it will cost?","Mr. Speaker, we tabled hundreds of pages for the member's edification before the standing committee just before the last election. \lineBreak However, if he is worried about the costs, I hope that he could just spend a bit of time worrying about the cost to victims in this country, because this is who the bill targets. It gets those violent individuals, those individuals who sexually exploit others and the people in the drug trafficking business off the street, and that should have the support of the hon. member and his party for a change."
668,"Mr. Speaker, it is shocking that the government is ramming the bill through the House and yet refusing to tell Canadians anything about what it costs.  \lineBreak The Parliamentary Budget Officer told us yesterday that it was unprecedented, in his 30-year career, to have such a major piece of legislation that we know will cost billions of dollars. The cost is not turning up in a single government document. There are no budget items on this whatsoever, not a single line anywhere. \lineBreak When will the government come clean on what it will cost the Canadian taxpayer?","Mr. Speaker, we report to Parliament about the costs of the individual pieces of legislation. \lineBreak The NDP says that it knows it will cost billions. I would ask the member to table all those documents that he has. That would be very interesting, because they are completely out of line with what we have been saying and what we have laid before Parliament. \lineBreak We should try to agree on something. I think we can all agree that if we spent $1 fighting crime in this country, it would be opposed by the NDP."
669,"Mr. Speaker, it is sad to see that, for all the government's crime rhetoric, one of its top priorities is to roll back the clock on legal protections against extremist hate speech.  \lineBreak Will the minister tell Canadians why the government is moving to make it easier for racist, sexist and anti-Semitic commentary to flourish online?","Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what the member is referring to. The bill before Parliament targets drug dealers, the people who traffic in narcotics, the people who bring drugs into this country and the people who sexually exploit children. That is the government legislation. What is she referring to?"
670,"Mr. Speaker, the minister may wish to listen to what some of his colleagues are saying in press conferences or in what they are tabling before this House. \lineBreak We learned this morning that a number of Conservative MPs believe that hate speech laws are futile. In our communities, hate speech all too often results in acts of violence. It is irresponsible for the government to repeal these laws and it shows that the government is out of touch with reality and Canadian values. \lineBreak Can the minister prove that he is committed to protecting Canadians from hate speech?","Mr. Speaker, we protect all victims in this country. We consult with victims across this country. We sit down with them. We hear what they have to say. The bill that is before Parliament right now, Bill  \lineBreak What I will do for the hon. member, because she should hear from those victims' groups as well, is ask those groups that when they come to Ottawa again to please spend a bit of time with the NDP and the Liberals so they will know the things that we know that we are legislating on."
671,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians were justifiably shocked to learn that in Saudi Arabia a woman can face a punishment of 10 lashes for the simple act of driving a car, a routine act for most women in any democracy. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada has enjoyed good diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for many years, but reports of a Saudi woman being sentenced to 10 lashes for the crime of driving her own car are deeply disturbing. \lineBreak Although we have heard some positive signs of reform announced in recent weeks, I think I speak on behalf of all members of the House when I condemn, in the sharpest terms, this deeply offensive court decision."
672,"Mr. Speaker, we now know that the  \lineBreak Does the minister really think it is appropriate for him to use valuable military search and rescue resources to visit Conservative appointees?","Mr. Speaker, the member has it wrong again. He has been wrong all week. He has made misleading statements in the House before. \lineBreak I was there on a trip that I paid for myself. I spent some time with my friends in beautiful Newfoundland and Labrador. I made the decision to leave the trip early to come back to work."
673,"Mr. Speaker, the minister had been warned there were barely enough helicopters to meet basic search and rescue requirements. \lineBreak  Our search and rescue response standard of two hours is the worst in the world. Replacing our 50-year-old fixed-wing SAR aircraft is stalled because of government mismanagement. The government is closing down rescue centres in Quebec and St. John's, and the closest SAR helicopter to the Arctic is in Ontario. \lineBreak Why will the minister not fix search and rescue in Canada instead of using SAR assets as personal transportation?","Mr. Speaker, all search and rescue assets that are involved in exercises or demonstrations would immediately divert if they were called upon. The member knows that because he has participated in these as well. \lineBreak When it comes to the issue of military procurement, support for the military, support for economic measures, the record of the New Democratic Party is a train wreck on the economy and heretics on military procurements."
674,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian search and rescue helicopter fleet can barely meet demand. The situation is so serious that parts are taken from one helicopter and used on another. Nevertheless, one of just three helicopters based in Gander, one of the regions with the greatest need, was used by the minister for a pleasure trip. \lineBreak How many helicopters will have to be grounded before the minister stops using them as his personal taxis?","Mr. Speaker, I left the trip early to go back and do some work. \lineBreak With respect to the search and rescue assets, as a result of pressing needs, the Department of National Defence has purchased a large number of spares from the United States, at a very reasonable price I might add, that came about as a result of a project cancellation. With that purchase and those new parts, we will be able to significantly increase the availability and yearly flying time of the Cormorant fleet.  \lineBreak It was the cancellation of this important contract replacement by a previous Liberal government that left us in the situation where we are flying 50-year-old helicopters."
675,"Mr. Speaker, the minister misused DND resources when our search and rescue helicopters can barely meet needs. If the minister is so interested in search and rescue operations, we again wonder why the St. John's and Quebec City search and rescue centres are being closed. \lineBreak What is this government's priority—fishing trips or providing services to the public and the tools to which the military is entitled?","Mr. Speaker, the consolidation of the sub-centres into the existing Joint Rescue Coordination Centres will have no negative impacts on the current level of service provided by the Canadian Coast Guard. This does not in any way affect the availability of Coast Guard ships, the Coast Guard auxiliary or the Canadian Forces aircraft. The consolidation represents a positive change by locating all Maritime air search and rescue coordinators into the same centres working side by side."
676,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that the Conservative government has threatened to pull the plug on the RCMP in British Columbia if the province does not accept a new policing contract by November.  \lineBreak The Conservatives are callously willing to jeopardize public safety in order to ram through a new contract with the province. Instead of being tough on crime, they are being tough on our front-line officers and tough on provinces. \lineBreak Is pulling police off the streets in British Columbia part of the government's so-called crime agenda?","Mr. Speaker, our government is willing to renew contract policing agreements with the provinces. After four intensive years of negotiations, it is now up to the provinces to decide whether to come on board.  \lineBreak The same fundamental terms and conditions will apply to all provinces. Saskatchewan and Alberta have accepted the agreement. British Columbia will have to decide whether to accept the agreement."
677,"Mr. Speaker, the government likes to talk tough on crime, but when it comes to front-line police, it continues to fall down on the job. It is telling the government in British Columbia to take it or leave it on the contract offer. \lineBreak British Columbians need to know that the result of these negotiations will not be a threat to the safety of their communities. Will the minister stand in the House right now and commit that the RCMP is staying put in British Columbia? Will the government stop playing fast and loose with the safety of British Columbians in these negotiations by telling British Columbia to take it or leave it?","Mr. Speaker, it is not up to the federal government to determine how the province wishes to carry out its provincial responsibilities in respect of policing. We have been negotiating now for four years. There have been intensive negotiations for four years. Some of the provinces have accepted the agreement and  some have not yet decided. It is up to the provinces to make that decision. We do not force provinces to accept the RCMP. We think it is a good deal, but it is up to the provinces to do it."
678,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday I tabled in the House my private member's bill, an act respecting the national flag of Canada. The purpose of this enactment is to ensure that all Canadians have the right to fly the national flag of Canada.  \lineBreak The Canadian flag represents all Canadian citizens. It represents pride in our great nation and support for those who have sacrificed their lives for the principles which it embodies: freedom, democracy, courage, and the justice upon which our great nation was built. \lineBreak Could the minister tell the House how important the Canadian flag is to our heritage?","Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the member for  \lineBreak I applaud and support the member's bill so that we can have absolute clarity with federal law. Any Canadian who wishes to fly the Canadian flag should be able to do so, free from bullying, free from intimidation, and to do so proudly as a Canadian from coast to coast to coast."
679,"Mr. Speaker, Remembrance Day is just around the corner. That day gives us an opportunity to remember the tremendous sacrifices made by Canadians and to pay tribute to those who died for our country.  \lineBreak Why does the government pay up to $13,000 for Canadian Forces members' funerals, but only $3,600 for veterans' funerals? Why does this government care more about gazebos than veterans?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. This allows me to highlight the excellent work of the funeral and burial program, which is managed by the last post fund, with which we work closely. Assistance for funerals and burials is offered to veterans who have suffered injuries related to their service, regardless of their rank or the medals they have received. We will continue working with the last post fund and exploring other ways to provide quality services to our veterans."
680,"Mr. Speaker, according to leaked U.S. diplomatic cables, Khaled Samy Abdallah Ismail was arrested and sent to a secret U.S. detention facility in Afghanistan because of suspicious behaviour. It turns out he has a mental illness and was deemed low risk. It took eight months for a consular official to visit him, and nine months more for him to get home. \lineBreak Why the delay in providing basic consular services to a Canadian citizen in need?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my hon. friend for her question and also to welcome her to this important file. I am going to enjoy working with her. \lineBreak I have to inform the hon. member that we do not comment on the contents of leaks. I would also point out that the document she is referring to is not a Canadian diplomatic cable."
681,"Mr. Speaker, Ukraine has undergone a considerable transformation since the beginning of the Orange Revolution. However, what originally seemed an unstoppable wave of democratic freedom has since gone sour with the news that former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko is being politically persecuted.  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, our government has expressed to the Ukrainian government our serious concern about the apparent bias in the ongoing judicial proceedings against former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Political persecution is completely unacceptable. The appearance of political bias in judicial proceedings undermines the rule of law.  \lineBreak We urge, here today, the Ukrainian government to strengthen judiciary independence. We will continue to support efforts to build a peaceful, democratic and prosperous society in Ukraine. "
682,"Mr. Speaker, in 1959 the Diefenbaker government scrapped the Avro Arrow, and much of the Canadian aviation industry along with it, throwing 30,000 Canadians out of work. Now this Conservative government has done it again. Last week it evicted the world's only replica of the Avro Arrow, along with hundreds of veteran volunteers.  \lineBreak Canadian veterans have asked their minister to reverse this disdainful decision. Will the Conservatives listen to Canadian veterans and allow their museum to continue?","Mr. Speaker, the member more than likely knows that this museum is on the land of Downsview Park, which is a crown corporation. This was a business decision made by Downsview. "
683,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak What will it take before the ","Mr. Speaker, the bill targets those who are involved with organized crime, the people who traffic in drugs, the people who bring drugs into this country, and the people who sexually exploit children. Canadians have not rejected that, but I know Quebec rejected the Bloc. We know that for sure. "
684,"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for that brilliant response. \lineBreak Every day we learn about new projects in which the minister was personally involved with the help of his constituency office staffers. He told his friends not to worry, that whatever could not be included in the G8 budget would be included in the economic action plan. That is serious. \lineBreak The Minister of Foreign Affairs keeps telling us that the Auditor General had access to all the information in order to conduct her investigation. Now that we know that is not true, are we going to start getting real answers?","Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General presented a report. \lineBreak  The government has fully accepted the advice that she provided on ways we can improve the reporting to Parliament in the years to come. We thank her for her work. We have aired all of the responses to the questions that have been brought up on this issue. \lineBreak What Canadians expect their members of Parliament to be doing is to be focusing on their priorities: the creation of jobs, economic growth, hope and opportunity. That is what the government is doing, focusing like a laser on the priority of Canadian families, the economy."
685,"Mr. Speaker, we need investments urgently to reduce congestion and avoid further thickening of our border. Our prosperity and our economy depend on this, things like a modern rail tunnel, improved Nexus, and border infrastructure that will reduce wait times. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, this government has made unprecedented financial commitments to support border infrastructure, nowhere more anywhere in Canada than in Windsor, Ontario, apparent where the government has a strong partnership with the provincial government, a strong partnership with the State of Michigan and a strong partnership with the Obama administration in Washington. \lineBreak We are working tremendously hard to ensure that trade can flow better across that border. What we need is for New Democrats to stand in their place and say that they support free trade, that they support free trade with the United States, and that they support NAFTA. \lineBreak Will the member opposite do that?"
686,"Mr. Speaker, the government is tolerating ministers who fail to understand their role or why they are entrusted with money. A $50 million fund was set up for projects that supposedly were related to the G8 summit. I want to remind the ministers and the government that this money was meant to be used to improve border infrastructure, including what is in my riding. \lineBreak Will our government finally allow the truth to come out on this waste of public money?","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the member that this government under this  \lineBreak New Democrats voted against every single dollar of that fund. Shame on the member. Shame on the New Democratic Party."
687,"Mr. Speaker, the National Council of Welfare said today that poverty costs Canada more than $24 billion a year, double what it would cost to lift every Canadian out of poverty. Tolerating poverty is bad economics.  \lineBreak The council calls for an investment approach toward poverty, for example, by investing in housing, early childhood education and aboriginal employment. Why not have a strategy to end poverty, save money and help the economy?","Mr. Speaker, how we tackle poverty first and foremost is by ensuring the economy is growing, creating jobs, making investments in such things as housing and education, as well as providing tax breaks for people entering the workforce, as the "
688,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak I have a very simple question for the ","Mr. Speaker, the government has already responded to all of these questions here in the House of Commons. I am surprised to see the Liberal Party continuing on this path, after the election results. The Auditor General examined this issue. The government accepted her recommendations, and we have answered all of the questions."
689,"Mr. Speaker, according to the Auditor General, the quality of life gap between our first nations and other Canadians continues to grow, and the government has not managed to work with the first nations to resolve the problem. \lineBreak Will the government commit, through a new partnership among governments, to provide equal funding for services of equal quality, as called for by the National Chief, Mr. Atleo?","Mr. Speaker, the government has a responsibility to treat taxpayer money prudently.

693,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Why is the Prime Minister insisting on cutting public services, yet in January he gave the most profitable corporations a gift of $4 billion?","Mr. Speaker, this government has invested a record amount in Canadian infrastructure across the country. That is one of the reasons why analysts support our economic action plan, which is creating an impressive number of jobs in Canada. But again, when it is up to the NDP to make a suggestion, the only thing the leader of the opposition proposes is to increase taxes. This government is against increasing job-killing taxes."
694,"Mr. Speaker, as Canadians brace for another recession, we learn that our  \lineBreak The government will not invest in infrastructure, in health care or jobs, but it will invest millions in making that minister the frequent flyer champion of government jets. \lineBreak When will the government ground that high flying minister?","Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to get that question from the hon. member.

When this minister pays his respects to the families of our fallen soldiers I expect the official opposition to support us and the minister by showing respect for these families."
698,"Mr. Speaker, we are now 112 days and counting and here is something new about the Muskoka boondoggle. When the mayor set out to buy steel for the hockey arena, even though it had not been approved by Parliament, the Muskoka minister did not tell him to wait. He wrote, “Hey, thanks for the update, Claude. Is it possible to go ahead with the purchase without making an official announcement? Otherwise I would be put in an uncomfortable position”. \lineBreak It is not just uncomfortable, it is wrong. He cannot spend taxpayer dollars on the sly. If the minister disagrees with this assessment, then maybe he should stand and explain to Parliament why.","Mr. Speaker, there was so much enthusiasm about Canada's economic action plan, there was so much enthusiasm about infrastructure projects around the country that the mayor was prepared to put the steel on his own credit card because he was so excited to create jobs in that part of the country. That happened from coast to coast to coast, great partnerships with the provinces, with territories, with municipalities from every part of the country, all coming together to fight the recession.  \lineBreak For my friend from Timmins, the good news is that at the end of the day we saw more jobs, more hope and more opportunity."
699,"Mr. Speaker, Parliament was misled. This is a guy who was buying steel for a hockey arena with border infrastructure money that had not even been approved by Parliament. It is the minister's emails, his influence peddling and his misuse of taxpayers' dollars. \lineBreak  If this was good news, why did he tell the mayor to keep his mouth shut? This is about an abuse of public trust. It has been 112 days of this charade of hiding behind the ","Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of muckraking that Canadians rejected in the last election campaign. This is just same old, same old. \lineBreak  The Canadian people want us to focus on jobs and the economy. They want us to focus on economic growth.

700,"Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the NDP revealed new information about the unsavoury activities of the President of the Treasury Board and his slush fund. He siphoned off $17 million to build an Olympic-sized arena in Huntsville. His constituency office distributed taxpayer money for secret projects. He even managed to find a job for a friend. What an obliging minister. Meanwhile, the Ontario Provincial Police is investigating the Gravenhurst project, a project in which he was also involved.  \lineBreak Will the minister finally answer questions about his management of public money in his riding?","Mr. Speaker, the project the member opposite refers to in Gravenhurst has nothing to do with the G8 legacy fund. I would challenge the member opposite, if he wants to accuse any member of this place of anything unethical, to have the courage and the guts to go outside and repeat those scurrilous allegations."
701,"Mr. Speaker, I was expecting the same from the President of the Treasury Board. He should have the courage to rise in the House and answer our questions. \lineBreak I think that I expressed myself clearly and in proper French. The question had to do with the management of funds in the riding of the member for  \lineBreak The NDP revealed new information this week. Can the government at least change its tape and respond to the new discoveries we have revealed?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP has just revealed the same old, same old. If the member opposite would like to make any allegations of anything untoward, he should have the courage to do it outside this place. \lineBreak The bottom line is that I approved 32 projects under this fund. All 32 projects were for public infrastructure. They all came in on or under budget. Every dollar has been accounted for. The good news is a lot of jobs and a lot of hope and opportunity were created with those infrastructure projects."
702,"Mr. Speaker, as a single mother, I have very busy days. Between helping my son with his homework, making meals, rushing to drop him off at school, going to the office and returning to pick him up on time, the last thing I want is to hear about the mismanagement of public funds at the G8 summit. \lineBreak The minister will not answer questions and refuses to take responsibility. Is that really the example we want to set for our children?","Mr. Speaker, this issue has been thoroughly aired before, during and after the last election campaign. The Auditor General has come forward with some positive observations on how the government could do an even better job at being more open and transparent. The government has accepted all those recommendations and will continue to work constructively with the Auditor General to constantly raise the bar to do an even better job for hard-working taxpayers."

We have an important role to ensure that our research-based approach toward ozone monitoring contributes to the world's understanding of this critical fact. "
706,"Mr. Speaker, this government is preventing Environment Canada from protecting Canadians from climate change and pollution. This year, the budget was cut by 59%. The report from the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy is a warning about the disastrous consequences this government's out-of-touch policies will have on our economy. \lineBreak If the minister refuses to act to save the environment, will he at least act to save the economy?","First, Mr. Speaker, I know the NDP has trouble following the budget process and I would ask my colleague to wait for the supplementary estimates, which are due next month. \lineBreak With regard to the report that she refers to, my colleague knows well that our government has a plan, a very good plan, to meet our target of reducing greenhouse gases by 17% from 2005 base levels by 2020. \lineBreak We are moving forward to reduce greenhouse gases and, at the same time, we are investing in programs to help Canadians adapt to climate change."
707,"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the facts. The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy just reported that without immediate government action, climate change could cost Canada $5 billion a year by 2020. By 2050, the government inaction could cost Canadians up to $43 billion a year. Our coastal communities, our forestry industry and the health of Canadians will all suffer unless we take action right now. Yet this out-of-touch government has produced no plan to deal with the impact of climate change on Canadians. \lineBreak Where is the plan?","Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that my colleague is so surprised by these projections and these numbers. Today's report merely echoes what our government has long recognized, and that is the importance of adaptation to climate change. \lineBreak Budget 2011, most recently, for example, included a $58 million investment to continue to support federal programs aimed at helping Canadians adapt to climate change."
708,"Mr. Speaker, I guess it is time to learn to swim. \lineBreak It is sad to see how ridiculous the situation at Environment Canada is becoming. The deputy minister will go to any lengths to discover which scientists disclosed the planned cuts to the ozone monitoring program. It is a witch hunt.  \lineBreak Why is this government putting scientists under the microscope instead of encouraging their vital work?","Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my NDP colleague, as well as my Liberal colleague, to do a little more original research rather than rely on flawed media reports.  \lineBreak As I have said, my deputy minister has rejected that story as a complete mischaracterization of his conversation. \lineBreak Canadians elected a strong, stable, environmentally responsible Conservative majority government to take care of the environment, and that is exactly what we are doing."
709,"Mr. Speaker, I wish the government were as interested in the environment as it is in stifling dissent. \lineBreak First the government denied that its cuts were going to have any impact on Canadians and then it went on a witch hunt. It went after whistleblower scientists who revealed the serious health and environmental impacts of these cuts. \lineBreak When will the minister take a break from hunting down whistleblowers and actually tell us about how these cuts will affect Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I reject completely the several assumptions in my colleague's question. \lineBreak Environment Canada makes no apologies at all for finding the most cost-effective ways of protecting both the environment and Canadian jobs."

711,"Mr. Speaker, macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss for Canadian seniors. It affects thousands of people. \lineBreak The government agency in charge of evaluating drug costs is recommending a drug that costs seniors a staggering $1,500 a month instead of a drug which costs only $7 a month. Experts say these drugs are virtually identical. \lineBreak Why is the government choosing to drain seniors' pocketbooks?","Mr. Speaker, our government recognizes the importance of affordable access to drugs as part of our quality health care system. \lineBreak We work with the provinces and the territories, which are responsible for deciding which drugs are publicly covered. That is why we have consistently increased transfers to the provinces and territories, by over 30% since we formed government, so that they can continue to meet the health care needs of their residents."
712,"Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a government agency that is making these recommendations. \lineBreak Clearly, switching to a cheaper drug would give seniors a much needed break and would save the government around $100 million a year. \lineBreak I am sure the minister is aware of reports saying that the drug manufacturer is manipulating the supply to favour the costlier drug. \lineBreak Why does the government continue to allow drug recommendations based on corporate profits and not on what is best for Canadians? Where is the plan for making drugs more affordable?","Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of the provinces and territories to decide whether or not to provide their residents with a publicly financed drug therapy. \lineBreak Many jurisdictions already offer catastrophic drug coverage to their residents. We have continued to increase the funding to the provinces and territories. Each jurisdiction will then decide how those dollars are allocated to meet their residents' needs."

The same fundamental terms and conditions that have been offered to British Columbia other provinces have accepted. Saskatchewan and Alberta have accepted and have said this is a good deal. Now it is up to British Columbia. It can accept the agreement, or it can choose other alternatives."
718,"Mr. Speaker, all British Columbians are asking for is a fair deal on policing, one with more community input and better accountability.

Of course, before we can even think about a new structure, whatever that may be, we must ensure that the existing bridge continues to support the current traffic and that it remains safe. That is what we are doing and the Champlain Bridge is safe."

It is going after them for thousands of dollars. These are not tax cheats. \lineBreak Why is the government not doing more to protect these law-abiding citizens?","Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear to the American authorities that Canada of course is not a tax haven, that the request for information from American citizens who are living in Canada affects a large number of citizens who have never earned income in the United States and many of whom were not aware of their obligation under American law, which is their right to file income tax returns. \lineBreak We have asked the Americans to exercise some discretion in the IRS with respect to these demands."
723,"Mr. Speaker, advocates of the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly have been waging a dirty, underhanded campaign against our government's strong mandate to deliver on our election promise of marketing freedom.

727,"Mr. Speaker, as is often the case, we would like to know what the plans are for the rest of the week. In particular, the official opposition would like to know when the government will finally bring before the House its so-called priorities, that is, the economy and jobs. It seems we have seen everything but the economy and jobs since they arrived.  \lineBreak It is thanks to the NDP official opposition that today the House is debating, for the first time this fall, the economic issues that are so important to worried Canadians. We are debating a motion calling on the government to take action on the economy, to establish a plan to create real jobs for Canadians and their families, to address Canada's infrastructure deficit of over $100 billion, which is mortgaging our future and that of future generations, and to protect people's retirement pensions. \lineBreak Now the NDP has proposed concrete actions to address these issues, and I am sure the government will support them. \lineBreak Also, could the ","Mr. Speaker, with the global economy still fragile, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to continue our focus on the economic recovery.

729,"Mr. Speaker, high unemployment is costly to Canada and nowhere is it clearer than in aboriginal communities.  \lineBreak The National Council of Welfare says that the higher unemployment of aboriginals is costing Canada's economy more than $35 billion a year in lost production and billions more in lost tax revenue.  \lineBreak When will the government build the economy by investing in communities instead of cutting public services?","On the contrary, Mr. Speaker, in the government's economic action plan, we made important infrastructure investments in aboriginal communities, and in the most recent budget, the measures of which are still finding their way through this Parliament, we have made important investments specifically in training aboriginal people for the jobs that exist. \lineBreak I think what aboriginal Canadians would especially support would be if the NDP would support those positive measures for aboriginal people."
730,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Parliamentary Budget Officer reported that the government's fiscal plan is unsustainable. Its ill-conceived corporate tax cuts are responsible for the fiasco we are facing.  \lineBreak The cuts, which amount to $15 billion a year in lost revenue, are almost exactly the same amount as the PBO's estimate for the structural deficit. That is further evidence of the Conservative government's mismanagement of the economy.  \lineBreak When will the Conservatives listen to reason and cancel the next gift to profitable corporations?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's facts are very deceiving. In fact, the low-tax plan that the government has put in place is actually addressing the issue he is talking about. \lineBreak  The long recognized aging population issue will impact Canadians, as would the $10 billion hike in taxes that the NDP would need. \lineBreak Our low-tax plan will help seniors prepare for retirement."
731,"Mr. Speaker, the government's priorities are quite clear. It wants to give $60 billion in tax cuts to mostly large, profitable corporations. As we have just heard, it is using the bogus argument that this will result in jobs for Canadians. At the same time, the government is imposing a $16 million EI tax hike on the payrolls of small businesses and the paycheques of workers. \lineBreak It is rewarding corporations for non-performance and is overcharging Canadians for an employment insurance program that the Conservatives are using as a deficit-fighting tool.  \lineBreak When will the government put middle-class Canadian families first?","Mr. Speaker, the last three budgets that the NDP voted against included plans to help ordinary Canadians. In fact, the tax reductions we have put in place provide a Canadian family of four over $3,000 in additional moneys, leaving it in that family's pockets where it should be. \lineBreak That is what helps Canadians, not a $10 billion tax hike."
732,"Mr. Speaker, two million Canadians are unemployed and will be for a long time because the Conservatives' economic inaction plan is a disaster. This particularly holds true for young people. There are approximately 200,000 more unemployed youth than there were before the last recession. This is mortgaging the future of our country, but the Conservatives are satisfied. \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives refuse to admit that their policy is not working? Why not invest in people?","Mr. Speaker, we are not satisfied if one Canadian who wants to work is still looking for a job. That is why our last budget focused on jobs and growth. \lineBreak We continue to put forward tax reductions for businesses that actually hire young and middle-age Canadians. The most important contribution we can make is to provide an avenue for businesses to create more jobs for Canadians. That is witnessed by the fact that there are 600,000 more Canadians now working than there were at the end of the recession."
733,"Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. The NDP agrees that the cost of private members' bills should be calculated, but the government is tying the Parliamentary Budget Officer's hands. It has slashed his budget and is refusing to provide his office with the resources he needs to do his job. It makes us wonder whether the Conservatives really want the cost of private members' bills to be calculated or whether this is one of their political manoeuvres to overload him and prevent him from examining public finances. \lineBreak Will the government give the Parliamentary Budget Officer the means to do his job?","Mr. Speaker, we believe the people of Canada, as well as the members of Parliament who are making decisions on legislation, deserve to know the cost is of that legislation. \lineBreak Committees are the masters of their own business. That is where that motion originated. However, there is merit in what the suggestion that Canadians should be able to know what the cost proposals are. It is a very good value."
734,"Mr. Speaker, we have already said that the NDP supports the costing of private members' bills. However, it is obvious that the Conservatives are attacking the Parliamentary Budget Officer for telling the truth about the Conservatives' poor fiscal management. Suddenly, they are saying they support his mandate. Will they use the same logic with their crime bill? All week, the ministers refused, over and over again, to give this bill a price tag, despite our repeated requests. \lineBreak Will the government allow the Parliamentary Budget Officer to cost its bills before they are passed in the House?","Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Budget Officer reports to Parliament and offers opinions all the time on all kinds of things. Recently, I have noticed that some of the media have commented on how accurate those comments are. People can make their own judgments on that.  \lineBreak However, the government's perspective is clear. We set out clear budget plans. We follow them. The costs of what we are doing are clear. We issue supplementary estimates and estimates all the time that set out those costs. \lineBreak The one thing that is different regarding the costs set out by the government and what they would be under the NDP is that we are actually respecting tax dollars. We are trying to keep spending down. We are not looking at ramping up the costs of government the way the NDP would."

738,"Mr. Speaker, for several years now 6,800 veterans who are disabled have been fighting the government over what is called SISIP benefit reduction. Two DND ombudsmen have said that this is unfair. The veterans committee, the Senate committee and the House all voted to change this practice.  \lineBreak Why is the government spending over half a million dollars of hard-earned money fighting these disabled veterans in court? Why does the government not stop the court proceedings, deal with these veterans and reach a comparable settlement?","Mr. Speaker, injured personnel in the Canadian Forces are covered by a long-term disability insurance plan similar to the RCMP and other public servants. As the member well knows, they are also eligible for a Veterans Affairs Canada disability award of up to $270,000 under the new veterans charter, as well as an accidental dismemberment benefit of up to $250,000 under the Canadian Forces accidental dismemberment insurance plan. \lineBreak If the member opposite is referring to a matter that is now before the courts, it would not be appropriate for us to comment on that at this time."
739,"Mr. Speaker, in fairness to the hon. member, as he is new to the House it is quite possible that he does not understand what the SISIP benefit reduction is.

740,"Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks he can do whatever he wants. Today we learn that he broke the rules against having gold-plated business cards. Unfortunately, that is not the worst of it. There is not a word of French on these business cards. \lineBreak When the minister travels, does he represent all Canadians or just those who speak English?","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to send over a business card that is in both official languages. \lineBreak It says, “Minister of Foreign Affairs, 125 Sussex Drive”. All the information is available in both French and English."
741,"Mr. Speaker, I sent him my card just as an example and actually it is in three languages because some of us also include a language for the visually challenged. \lineBreak I wonder if the member might help with that because when the jet-setting Conservatives have their ministers--","Oh, come on."

Could the ","Mr. Speaker, at the root of all of this is marketing freedom for western Canadian farmers. We intend to deliver on that. Farmers have done the cost-benefit analysis farm gate by farm gate. They have voted with their air seeders and their trucks and have moved on to new commodities.  \lineBreak They have taken away market share from the wheats, durums and barleys in Canada. We know there is a global market demanding more of those products. If we look at the Australian model, it is producing up to 30% more of those commodities for a hungry world. \lineBreak  That is all the cost-benefit analysis that Canadian farmers need. They know they can step up and produce. I wish the member would get on board with them."
745,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak KPMG says that it will cost $500 million in closing costs alone, never mind the impact to the prairie rural agriculture economy. \lineBreak How can the government justify indulging the notion and the whim of the minister, at such an extraordinary cost, to abolish the Wheat Board without even knowing the cost-benefit analysis?","Mr. Speaker, I will give the member some homework this weekend. When he goes home to his riding in downtown Winnipeg, he should check with--oh, yes, there are no farmers there. Or, maybe when he goes on to his principal residence on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia, he could check with--oh, they are not under the Wheat Board.  \lineBreak He does not have a clue what he is talking about."
746,"Mr. Speaker, today the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in favour of InSite and against years of Conservative interference. The Supreme Court found that the government arbitrarily infringed on the rights of individuals to receive the treatment and help they so desperately need. \lineBreak The government has an opportunity here to take off its ideological blinders and support a vital public service that has saved lives and given people hope. Will the government do that?","Mr. Speaker, although we are disappointed with the Supreme Court of Canada's decision today, we will comply. \lineBreak We believe that the system should be focused on preventing people from becoming drug addicts. A key pillar of the national anti-drug strategy is prevention and treatment for those with drug dependency. As part of our strategy, we have made significant investments to strengthen existing treatment efforts through the treatment action plan. We will be reviewing the court decision."

More people get treatment, as InSite is there to connect people with the services they need. Today, the people who use this service have had their voices heard.

Will they stop being the barrier to this very important service?","Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, our government believes that spending more money on treatment and support to help people get off drugs is the best investment we can make.  \lineBreak As I also said earlier, we will be reviewing the decision. In fairness, the decision was made two hours ago. I stated that we will be reviewing it, and we will be reviewing it."
748,"Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling is clear. Insite saves lives without compromising public safety. Nonetheless, instead of looking at the facts and scientific studies, this government has spent years in court, at the taxpayers' expense, trying to shut down the Insite clinic. \lineBreak Will this government finally put aside its ideology and act in the best interest of the health and public safety of all Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, we are disappointed with the decision but we will comply.

750,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians spend, on average, 75 minutes a day getting to work, which is 32 working days a year. Days wasted being stuck in traffic is costing the economy $5 billion a year. Traffic gridlock and crumbling roads are all around us and Canada is the only G8 country without a national transit strategy. \lineBreak Does the minister agree with me that Canada is falling behind on public transit?","Mr. Speaker, I have to correct the facts. Like all other G8 countries, Canada assigns responsibility for public transit to the provinces and municipalities.  \lineBreak Since 2006, we have invested $5 billion into public transit across Canada, and we will continue to do that."
751,"Mr. Speaker, it is time to get Canada moving. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, big city mayors, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Urban Transit Authority have all been calling for a national transit strategy. \lineBreak My bill sets a plan for all levels of government to work together to establish a national vision for public transit. \lineBreak Will the government get Canada moving and join together with the New Democrats to finally establish a national transit plan?","Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government recognizes the value of modern and efficient urban transit. We have been a strong partner with the provinces and municipalities to help them build some of the best transit systems in the world. However, it is not the role of the federal government to tell cities how to run their transit systems."
752,"Mr. Speaker, in all of the country's major cities, workers are encountering frustrating traffic congestion every day. Our road infrastructure is crumbling. In Montreal, people are afraid to cross the Champlain Bridge. In Toronto, there is no longer any such thing as rush hour; every hour of the day and night is rush hour. \lineBreak Is the government going to respond to the unanimous demands of cities and business people and provide public transit that is reliable, accessible and affordable?","Mr. Speaker, never in the history of this country has a government invested more in the development and repair of infrastructure than this government has. We have invested a significant amount of money in the Toronto Rocket project in the greater Toronto area, among other things.  \lineBreak What has the NDP done?

Through his personal emails, we were able to see what happened with the $50 million of public money. \lineBreak Should the minister not be able to rise and respond?","Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to tell my colleague that the President of the Treasury Board will appear before a House committee to answer all the questions that members have for him. I have good news for my colleague: he will get two for the price of one, because I will be there too. As always, I am happy to answer questions with my colleague, the President of the Treasury Board. "
760,"Mr. Speaker, doctors around the world have been saying it, the CMA has been saying it, and now the Supreme Court has said it unanimously: Insite in Vancouver saves lives. That is why the Liberal government supported it from the start, choosing life over death. \lineBreak With today's hearty slap in the face by Canada's highest court, will the government finally admit it was wrong in its ideological attacks against Insite? What does the minister mean by “We will be reviewing it”? \lineBreak Will the government respect the Supreme Court's decision and stop attacking Insite?","Mr. Speaker, not to repeat my answers that I provided earlier, the decision was released two hours ago. We will review the decision of the Supreme Court. \lineBreak I am sure the members opposite have not had the opportunity to review the decision either. We will do our part and our due diligence and review the Supreme Court decision."
761,"Mr. Speaker, it is time for this government to agree to study hydraulic fracturing. The problem, however, is that this practice is already taking place. Communities have good reason to be worried about the chemicals being used and the groundwater being contaminated.  \lineBreak Will the minister respect the government's mandate, which is to regulate this practice, instead of simply waiting until new studies are published?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that this is mainly a provincial and territorial responsibility. \lineBreak I had the pleasure of debating this very issue during adjournment proceedings last week. I can tell the member opposite that a greater understanding of environmental impacts will benefit us all. That is why we have put forward two studies that we mentioned last week.  \lineBreak Let me remind my colleague that our government has created nearly 600,000 new jobs and that responsible development of shale gas has a potential to create even more."
762,"Mr. Speaker, not only does hydraulic fracturing require enormous amounts of water, but the process also uses a toxic brew of chemicals to pollute groundwater. Exactly what chemicals remains a mystery, as companies are not required to disclose that information. \lineBreak When will the government close the regulatory loopholes and force companies to reveal what chemicals they are injecting into our groundwater?","Mr. Speaker, as I said last week in adjournment proceedings, the "
763,"Mr. Speaker, there is concern across the country among many law-abiding Canadian citizens and taxpayers about the long arm of the U.S. tax collection department. Even the Canadian Bankers Association is upset. The Americans are trying to enforce their laws beyond their borders and are threatening Canadians to that effect.  \lineBreak So far, the government has offered Canadians tea and sympathy. Will the government do something a little more tangible? Will it set up an advocacy centre to actively inform and assist Canadians who are unfairly being put upon by the extraterritorial excursions of the U.S. IRS?","Mr. Speaker, certainly we are concerned with what is happening to many honest taxpaying Canadians who were not expecting this to be imposed upon them. The "

765,"Mr. Speaker, when I attended a meeting on Tuesday for the election of a new executive for the Canada-Israel group, I was most disappointed to see how few opposition members bothered to show up. Only three Liberal MPs and, shockingly, zero NDP MPs chose to attend. Let us compare that with the 60 Conservative MPs present. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, it is very disappointing that not one member of the NDP actually chose to attend this event and that only three Liberal members attended.  \lineBreak Whether it is our refusal to participate in the Durban II and III conferences, standing up for a negotiated two-party solution between Israel and Palestine, supporting a national task force on Holocaust research, or becoming the first country to sign the Ottawa protocol, our government's record of taking a principled stand against anti-Semitism and standing up for the Jewish community is clear. "
766,"Mr. Speaker, suicide prevention should be a national priority. Tragically, Canada's aboriginal youth suicide rate is five to six times higher than the Canadian average.  \lineBreak We know that providing healthy alternatives is the key: investments in education, recreation centres and the necessary programming. Prevention requires investment and does not mean waiting for the suicide rate to go up in communities. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives work with aboriginal communities, listen to the needs of aboriginal young people and stand up to build hope for so many of these people across our country?","Mr. Speaker, too many Canadian families have to deal with the anguish of losing a loved one to suicide. That is why our government is funding programs to build their strength on protective factors, such as ensuring that family and community supports are there. In budget 2010, $75 million was spent to implement the national aboriginal suicide prevention strategy to assist over 150 community-based projects."
767,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are clearly impressed by princess stories and seem willing to spare no expense to impose monarchist symbols: displaying the Queen's portrait at the Department of Foreign Affairs and in embassies, installing a stained glass window in the Senate, redesigning passports to include the crown, adding “royal” to the designation of the air force and navy, spending millions of dollars on royal visits, and I could go on. \lineBreak Instead of applauding, is the already discredited ","Mr. Speaker, I know that when this member first arrived in Ottawa, he put his hand on the Bible and took an oath to Queen Elizabeth II and her rightful heirs and successors.

I know there is great enthusiasm for the great work the  \lineBreak We are also very pleased that portraits of Canada's head of state now proudly adorn the walls of all of our museums around the world."

769,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  \lineBreak Did the minister do his own research and consult with scientists about the impact of his proposed cuts to ozone research? \lineBreak If the minister doubts the reports of an international witch hunt in the media, will he either unmuzzle his scientists or at least state that there will be no cuts to the ozone monitoring network?","Mr. Speaker, the minister and myself have said repeatedly in the House that we are not cutting our ozone monitoring program. We will continue to monitor ozone. I invite the member opposite to review those statements as well."
770,"Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary referred to the fact that there are taxes that are a real burden on Canadians and I think everyone could agree. The issue that really arises right now is the question of taxes on employment. It is the question of the proposal by the government to increase taxation on employment by $1.2 billion starting January 1, 2012. \lineBreak I ask the ","Mr. Speaker, let us take a look at our record through our economic action plan. We have created almost 600,000 net new jobs since the worst of the recession. That is a record unparalleled in the developed world. We did that in a number of ways including putting a freeze on EI premiums. We had to do that to make sure that companies were encouraged or at least were not prevented from employing people. We also have to strike a balance and make sure that the EI fund is balanced. That was our commitment to Canadians, that we would not create a $53 billion EI surplus like the Liberals did."
771,"Mr. Speaker, this is the third week of the fall session and this government, which claims that the economy and job creation are its main priority, has yet to accomplish anything. Not one thing. There has been no economic initiative, no real initiative. However, the government plans to reduce corporate taxes again on December 31. \lineBreak Does the government really believe that $22 billion, including $11 billion in bonuses for executives, is not enough for the chartered banks?","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we have taken a number of steps to adjust corporate and personal taxes throughout the country. Canada has weathered the global economic upheaval better than other countries as a result of its plan to reduce the tax burden. Since forming the government in 2006, we have put an average of $3,000 in the pockets of Canadian families. We also leave more money in the hands of entrepreneurs and businesses so they can grow and employ more Canadians. Our plan is working."
772,"Mr. Speaker, at this time the Conservatives are saddling future generations with the biggest environmental, economic and social debt in our history. Since coming to power, they have gutted the manufacturing sector and destabilized our previously balanced economy, which Canada has built up since the second world war. There is a great void—except for tax reductions for the banks that make $22 billion profits. \lineBreak When will they invest in good quality jobs for young people, who will have to foot the bill?","Mr. Speaker, let us stick to the facts. Our low tax plan has resulted in the creation of 600,000 net new jobs since 2009. Canada's economic leadership is recognized internationally. What we do know is that the NDP is pushing a plan that would increase our tax burden by $10 billion a year. We know that it would kill the economy and that is definitely not the direction that this government will take."
773,"Mr. Speaker, according to a release by Canadian Press, the  \lineBreak This was a top defence priority, yet the  \lineBreak Is ","Mr. Speaker, we have always worked closely with the  \lineBreak However, it is interesting to hear the hon. member talk about somehow reaching out to the Taliban or improving coordination inside Afghanistan. Even the Afghanistan government and the president himself have said that as a result of the assassination of Rabbani, it is back to business as usual. This unfortunately belays the fact that we cannot work with a terrorist organization that does not respect human rights, that does not respect women and that refuses to disarm.  \lineBreak I will take no advice from the member opposite."
774,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Conservative ministers do not even know what is going on in their own departments. So how can Canadians expect any transparency from this government?","Mr. Speaker, once again, that is false. \lineBreak I am very proud of the efforts the Canadian Forces have put forward in Afghanistan in conjunction with our other government departments. CIDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs have created an environment where there are now seven million Afghan children going to school. We are immunizing children. We are working with all of our international partners and the Afghanistan government. However, the New Democratic Party opposite has consistently voted against those efforts."
775,"Mr. Speaker, the Department of National Defence continues to spring leaks about the minister's misuse of DND assets. By now we have all heard that the minister takes government jets like most Canadians take the bus. Now we find out that the  \lineBreak  Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, as I and the  \lineBreak With respect to Afghanistan, we have made a magnificent effort on behalf of Canadians.

His feigned indignation once again brings shame to his party. In my four and one-half years as Minister of National Defence, I have made every effort to be at every repatriation of any fallen soldier, to be there to support the families and all the men and women in uniform who stand in harm's way on behalf of our country. I will continue to do that."

In fact, they said that they were wrong in the information they had on their website. While I am on my feet, they have also publicly disclosed that the cost of flights by the Department of National Defence are less than a third of the figures that CTV have been using."
778,"Mr. Speaker, the scientific journal  \lineBreak When will these scientists have their letters rescinded so that they can continue their important work, and when will the government allow the scientists the freedom to discuss their discovery?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians can indeed be proud of the great contribution that Environment Canada scientists make to international studies like this one on the arctic ozone hole. The findings are troubling, and that is why Environment Canada will continue to monitor the ozone. That is why the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre will continue to provide world-class services. \lineBreak Finally, Environment Canada scientists regularly talk to the media."
779,"Mr. Speaker, does the minister really understand the scope of the problem? Does he understand the science? \lineBreak For the first time, a large hole has been discovered in the ozone layer over the Arctic. This is a very serious problem and it is believed that climate change might be a factor. \lineBreak Even if he does not understand the science, does the minister realize that muzzling our scientists—and even worse, laying them off—would be very foolish, especially when their research has never been more crucial?","Mr. Speaker, let me say again that we are not muzzling scientists. They speak to the responsible media all the time, and they speak to and will brief environment critics on the other side of the House. \lineBreak As my colleague should know, Canada has banned ozone-depleting chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons. I was proud today to announce, with my colleague the "

No wonder the town councillors told him they did not want to have anything to do with him. We cannot hand out taxpayers' money from the trunk of a car. \lineBreak Would the minister stand in this House and explain such tawdry behaviour?","Mr. Speaker, the tone of that question is deeply disappointing, especially from that member. The minister did no such thing."
781,"Mr. Speaker, it is those kinds of answers that show the government's contempt for Canadians and accountability, and it is the Lake of Bays project that shows the minister's irresponsible attitude toward taxpayer spending. \lineBreak He promoted a scheme that had no business plan, no viability study, no idea of costs or even a construction plan, yet he was willing to throw millions at a project that even the town did not want to have anything to do with. \lineBreak Why did the Muskoka minister use taxpayers' money to feather his own political bed? Would he stand in this House and explain himself?","Mr. Speaker, let us put some facts on the record: no funding was given to the project that the member opposite speaks of."
782,"Mr. Speaker, the Franklin border crossing in my riding has been closed since April. Yet the Americans have increased patrols on their side of the border. The government claims that the economy is a priority, but cuts at the crossing in Franklin show the complete opposite. In addition to customs officers and business people, workers have also lost their jobs. As a result, the local economy and the security of neighbouring communities are in jeopardy. \lineBreak Will the government rethink its decision and invest in security and people's jobs?","Mr. Speaker, we share border concerns with the U.S. and we collaborate with the U.S. We want to ensure that we have a safe and secure border to make sure that criminals are not coming in but that fair trade and the movement of individuals and businesses is happening. \lineBreak We are watching taxpayers' dollars when it comes to the amalgamation of administration. We are very proud of two things: the way we watch over our borders as well as taxpayers' dollars."
783,"Mr. Speaker, constituents of Stormont, Dundas and South Glengarry and all Canadians are concerned about the possibility of a work stoppage on the St. Lawrence Seaway. The effects of a shutdown could be devastating to our economic recovery. \lineBreak Because the seaway plays such a vital role in the economic stability of Canada, could the ","Mr. Speaker, our government remains focused on the economic recovery and, of course, financial security for all Canadians.  \lineBreak The best deal that the parties can come to on their own is the best one that they will get.

784,"Mr. Speaker, last week, a Conservative member of Parliament said that his government was in the process of successfully modifying its approach to the abortion issue. On Friday, another Conservative MP said exactly the same thing. \lineBreak Is this government changing women's rights against their will or is the ","Mr. Speaker, we will admit that this issue stirs up passions. Nevertheless, the government is not reopening the debate. "
785,"Mr. Speaker, I am not exactly reassured by the minister's response. Three Conservative MPs are trying in a roundabout way to reopen the debate on abortion. In Canada, abortion has been legal for decades. Clearly, some Conservative MPs do not accept that, even though a majority of Canadians do. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, the position of this government is clear. While there are understandable passions and feelings on all sides of the House on all sides of the issue, our government's position is clear: we will not be reopening this issue."

Last week the  \lineBreak Either the government is opposed to laws banning hate speech or the ","Mr. Speaker, all members are entitled to enter private members' bills, and they will be debated and looked at by all members of the House. If the NDP has a different rule, let us hear what it is. \lineBreak We have been very clear. I was asked about the government's priorities and I indicated very clearly that we were going to go after drug dealers, the people who bring drugs into this country, and we are going after those individuals who sexually molest children. I would hope that for once this would get the support of the NDP."
787,"Mr. Speaker, while families struggle and Canada slides back into recession, the government is becoming distracted by its own caucus members. \lineBreak First it was abortion and now it is hate speech. What other out-of-touch issues does the government have up its sleeve? \lineBreak Why is the government pushing divisive and extreme private members' bills? Is it that the ","Mr. Speaker, our government's priorities have been quite clear. Our focus is on the economy. In fact, later today the members opposite will have an opportunity to support our low-tax plan for jobs and growth by voting in favour of a ways and means motion that is going to help advance that economic agenda. \lineBreak It is not surprising that Conservative members on their own would bring forward private members' bills that would combat crime, take on criminals, seek to help the economy and remove barriers to trade. Those are all sensible things for Conservatives to do. \lineBreak We hope that the opposition will see the wisdom in fighting crime and helping our economy as well."
788,"Mr. Speaker, a House committee that is dominated by the Conservatives made the extraordinary decision to call a judge before a parliamentary committee. \lineBreak I have a question for the ","Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics did invite a justice to appear before the committee, but let us be clear. We are going to introduce the judge's ruling as evidence before that committee and I hope that all members will review the good work that has been done by the justice in this regard. In fact, we will continue to push forward with inviting Canadians to come before our committee."

Why pursue the perimeter security when we are being nailed with discriminatory actions in Washington?","Mr. Speaker, it was not so long ago that members opposite were fighting greater trade opportunities south of the border with the United States with NAFTA and now they have come to embrace trade. We are working very closely with the Obama administration to try to make our economies more competitive. There are some proposals out there with which we take great issue and we will continue to fight for Canadian interests every day of the week. We believe in de-thickening the border as the best way to ensure future prosperity for people on both sides of the border."
790,"Mr. Speaker, a hole in the ozone layer twice the size of Ontario has developed over the Arctic this spring, exposing northern Canadians to dangerous levels of radiation. \lineBreak It was thanks to the research of Canadian scientists that we discovered the serious extent of this problem, but instead of taking action, the government has actually chosen to cut the ozone monitoring and research program. \lineBreak With such a serious threat looming over Canada, will Conservatives finally commit to fully fund ozone research?","Mr. Speaker, we have been around this any number of times in the past couple of weeks. \lineBreak Environment Canada has indeed contributed magnificently to this study. As I said earlier, the results are troubling. Canada banned ozone-depleting chemicals some years ago, but they remain in the atmosphere and in the stratosphere for many years. They will continue to negatively impact ozone for years to come."
791,"Mr. Speaker, it is only through the foreign media that Canadians are becoming aware of the threats to their health and their environment. \lineBreak David Tarasick conducted a study for Environment Canada which revealed the presence of a hole in the ozone layer, but this government is preventing him from talking to the media. \lineBreak Is the government trying to hide scientific data or trying to cover up its error in cutting the budget for monitoring the ozone layer?

This affects many Canadians throughout the country. The vast majority of people being targeted by the IRS are honest, hard-working and law-abiding. They have obediently paid their Canadian taxes.

We also believe that the system should be focused on preventing people from becoming drug addicts in the first place. Our government believes that spending money on treatment to support and help people stay off drugs is the best investment we can make."

795,"Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see they are so busy patting themselves on the back but with over 0.25 million seniors living in poverty, tax measures are not the solution. Many seniors are so poor they do not even pay taxes.  \lineBreak When will the minister take action to address the real problems facing our seniors by boosting access to home care, eliminating seniors poverty and supporting caregivers?","Mr. Speaker, our government was given a strong mandate. It is doing more for seniors than under any other government. It was our government that introduced pension income splitting and doubled the pension income credit. We lowered taxes and removed 380,000 seniors from the tax rolls completely. We also raised the guaranteed income supplement exemption, putting more money in the pockets of 1.6 million more seniors. What did the opposition do? It voted against all of these measures."

Provinces have full independence to make decisions on sales tax matters and out of respect for the elected provincial legislatures or assemblies, and we are going to hear about those in the next couple of days, Parliament has agreed to facilitate such provincial decisions."

That is why our government has its economic action plan. Yesterday in this House, we tabled hundreds of pages of specific measures to stimulate growth and create jobs. I encourage the NDP to stop voting against measures that are good for Canadians and our economy. "
804,"Mr. Speaker, workers' wages are not even keeping up with inflation. This government's response is to give billions of dollars worth of gifts to profitable companies.  \lineBreak In theory, eventually all this money will find its way back into workers' pockets. But that is obviously not the case. The result? Record levels of personal debt. \lineBreak What solutions does this government have to create good jobs and tackle the debt crisis?","Mr. Speaker, we put forward a plan in June and, if I recall, the NDP actually voted against every measure in it.  \lineBreak We are going to allow New Democrats to redeem themselves, because we have now tabled budget implementation act number two, which puts in place an extension of our Jobs and Economic Growth Act. In this is the temporary hiring credit for small business.  \lineBreak That is one of many items in this budget implementation act that would actually help create more jobs for Canadians. I would hope that the NDP would vote for it this time."
805,"Mr. Speaker, just reannouncing their failed or misguided policies is not good enough.  \lineBreak Canadians are worried. Canadians are crying out for immediate action, and they want the creation of decent jobs.

How are Canadians supposed to put their trust in him when even the Prime Minister does not?","Mr. Speaker, 2008 was quite a while ago. I am surprised the member is just hearing about this now. We have, of course, extended the mission in Afghanistan and transformed it to the important training mission. \lineBreak I was in Washington on Friday meeting with the secretary of defence to discuss the important role that Canada is playing there and the important contributions that Canada is making to world peace and security.

These are important contributions of which all Canadians can be extremely proud."

How can they trust a minister who is kept in the dark by his ","Mr. Speaker, to that I would simply say that Canadians must have had some level of trust because in May of this year they re-elected this government with a majority, national Conservative government.  \lineBreak It is the important decisions with respect to Afghanistan, Libya, our contributions in 16 missions internationally, our various government departments, including CIDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs, that we continue to make Canadians very proud of the efforts that Canadians, in both the armed forces and our professional service, are making around the globe."
810,"Mr. Speaker, it is a majority of 39%.  \lineBreak The  \lineBreak However, this government refuses to look into why the minister violated the act. His attitude is disrespectful to francophone and anglophone Canadians who want to understand what is happening in Parliament in their own language. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives finally respect the Official Languages Act and have the documents translated, as provided for in the act?","Mr. Speaker, yes, I tabled the documents in the House. Before I tabled these documents in the language that the judges used to send them to the government, I asked all of the NDP members whether they were in favour of having them tabled, and all of the NDP members said yes."
811,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, CBC revealed that the cost of the F-35s could double by the time they are delivered. Rather than the $65 million that this government initially told us that each plane would cost, they could cost over $133 million each. \lineBreak Why is this government the only one that believes Lockheed Martin's initial cost estimates? Why does this government not see the obvious? The replacement of the CF-18s requires an open and transparent competition.","Mr. Speaker, our government has been very clear. We have dedicated $9 billion to this important acquisition of F-35s.  \lineBreak These aircraft, as the House will know, will replace our aging CF-18 fleet of fighter jets. These aircraft, like other aircraft, have served our country extremely well. They are used in Libya today. They have been used in previous missions, but that they aging. \lineBreak As a matter of course we are taking the responsible step of following a procurement process that has been in place for a significant period of time in which a number of countries are participating."
812,"Mr. Speaker, while the costs related to the F-35s continue to rise, the Associate Minister of National Defence and the  \lineBreak Will this government stop trying to mislead the public and tell people the truth: that the F-35s are not going to cost $9 billion or even $16 billion but $30 billion? ","Mr. Speaker, we have been crystal clear. We committed $9 billion for the replacement of the CF-18. In fact, it not only includes the cost of the aircraft, this will include: spares, weapons systems, infrastructure and training simulators as well as the contingency associated with this important procurement.  \lineBreak We are purchasing the most cost-effective variant at the prime of peak production when the costs will be at their lowest. Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer has admitted to that. \lineBreak Why are the NDP members constantly against getting the best equipment for the best forces in the world?"
813,"Mr. Speaker, the government continues to pour money down the black hole of the F-35 program. That is despite multiple delays, multiple setbacks and massive cost overruns predicted, not only by our Parliamentary Budget Officer, but even by the Pentagon . \lineBreak The out-of-touch government would rather blow billions of dollars than admit it has made a mistake. \lineBreak We know the ","Mr. Speaker, I know the member is new to the file and new to the House. I will repeat for him, $9 billion have been set aside for this project. We will be receiving these aircraft some time after 2016. This is a result of a pressing need to replace the current CF-18 jets. \lineBreak This is the best aircraft, the only aircraft, which is fifth generation, available to the Canadian Forces. This recommendation comes from the Chief of the Air Staff. All of the experts agree, this is the best aircraft for the best country for the best forces."
814,"Mr. Speaker, we have submarines rusting in dry dock. We have helicopters being raided for spare parts. Yet, Conservatives insist on writing a blank cheque to the U.S. military. Even John McCain calls the F-35 program “a train wreck”. \lineBreak Other governments are reducing their F-35 orders, switching to other fighter jets or investing in equipment they already have, so why are the Conservatives taking a flyer on the F-35s, even when they are in a tailspin?","Mr. Speaker, so much of what that member just said is completely off base. So much of it is completely disconnected to what the needs of the men and women of the Canadian Forces have clearly expressed. So much of it is against our national defence interests, but I am not the least bit surprised. \lineBreak Consistently in this House, consistently throughout our history, we have seen the New Democratic Party oppose every step that we take to improve the life, the training, the work of the Canadian Forces. That has been its consistent position."
815,"Mr. Speaker, from the chief coroner's reports to pleas from the chief and Grand Chief Beardy, the suicides in Pikangikum First Nation, 60 in the last decade and 5 this summer alone, have become a tragedy of national proportion.  \lineBreak The chief coroner had 100 recommendations.  \lineBreak What exactly will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government has made the investment in programs to support initiatives under the national aboriginal youth suicide prevention program. To date, we funded over 150 community-based projects with the investments that we have made in budget 2010. This is an area that is of concern to us, as far too many Canadian families have to deal with the anguish, but we are acting on the recommendations through the national aboriginal youth suicide program."
816,"Mr. Speaker, in Nunavik, the suicide rate is 25 times higher than the Quebec average, which is already the highest in the country. Earlier this year, two young people committed suicide in less than two months in Kuujjuaq, a community of less than 2,200 people. No government is doing enough to address the issue of suicide. \lineBreak What does this government plan to do to improve support and health services in the community?","Mr. Speaker, there is no one answer to address suicide.  \lineBreak Our government has provided significant investments through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research on mental health. Our government also supports many major health promotion activities that have direct and indirect benefits on the mental health of Canadians, including programs like the embrace life council, the national aboriginal youth suicide prevention strategy, the national anti-drug strategy, the aboriginal head start, community action program for children, family violence initiatives, brighter futures, building healthy communities, and so on."
817,"Mr. Speaker, in Canada, thousands of people commit suicide each year, and far too many of them are young people between the ages of 15 and 24. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people in this age group. This already alarming suicide rate among young people is seven times higher among aboriginal and homosexual youth. \lineBreak  As critic for youth, I would like to ask the government if it is prepared to invest specifically in youth suicide prevention, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable youth.","Mr. Speaker, since coming into power, our Conservative government has worked to improve the quality of life of all Canadians dealing with mental health challenges.  \lineBreak Earlier this year, I was proud to announce significant funding for the mental health projects to help improve the emotional and social health of children aged 6 to 12 years of age, as well as parents, teachers and community leaders. We look forward to the continued progress of the Mental Health Commission and these projects in promoting mental health in Canada."
818,"Mr. Speaker, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development is clear: our natural resources are being developed despite the lack of information on the environmental impact. The  \lineBreak The minister has already broken his promise to regulate oil sands emissions this year. When will he implement an environmental plan for developing this natural resource?","Mr. Speaker, that question leaves out certain facts. \lineBreak I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the opposition's failure to recognize the commissioner's positive words on our government's accomplishments and our commitment with regard to oil sands monitoring. For example, the commissioner says: \lineBreak Our government does have a plan and I am glad the environment commissioner acknowledges it."
819,"Mr. Speaker, there is no plan and the Auditor General's report spells it out for us in black and white. \lineBreak It turns out that from day one the government actually planned to fail on fighting pollution and climate change.  \lineBreak Since its first plan was introduced in 2007, reductions are down by 90%, we have a hole in the ozone twice the size of Ontario, we have out of control oil sands pollution and there are ever-rising emissions. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives refusing to act? Why have they given up on the environment?","Mr. Speaker, our government has definitely not given up on the environment. \lineBreak I was delighted that the commissioner acknowledged that, in recognizing that beyond Kyoto, the federal government has made new international and national commitments to the Copenhagen accord and the Cancun agreements. \lineBreak  I can assure the opposition that our government is working to ensure Canadians have clean water to drink and clean air to breathe for generations to come."
820,"Mr. Speaker, the report tabled today confirms that the government gets failing marks when it comes to environmental protection. It is just one more example of how this government is not interested in the reality of the situation and has no plan for our environment. \lineBreak There is a hole in the ozone layer. That is a scientific fact.  \lineBreak Will the government commit to maintaining funding for the monitoring program?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP is all too willing to abandon Canada's interests and to sacrifice jobs for Canadians. \lineBreak Our government will balance the need to protect Canada's environment with the need to protect jobs for Canadians. \lineBreak As I have answered many times in the House in recent weeks, Environment Canada will continue to monitor the ozone. The World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre will continue to deliver world-class services."
821,"Mr. Speaker, the minister might be tired of talking about his reckless cuts to ozone monitoring but there are expert scientists who would love to talk and who are being muzzled by the government. \lineBreak We have a hole in the ozone twice the size of Ontario. We have increasing pollution, especially in the tar sands, and new evidence today shows that Conservatives have been planning to fail on the environment. \lineBreak It is no wonder that the minister is so afraid to hear from scientists. Where is the government's plan for ozone monitoring?","Mr. Speaker, as we have said any number of times in recent days, Canadians should be proud of the positive and terrific contributions that our scientists at Environment Canada make to international studies, such as the report on the Arctic ozone hole. \lineBreak We do not muzzle our scientists. Our scientists speak regularly with the media and are available to inform members of the opposition."
822,"Mr. Speaker, it sounds as though the  \lineBreak If the Prime Minister's Office did not determine this budget, can the minister rise and explain his email?","Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General released a report some time ago, a copy of which certainly made its way to the Canadian voters before election day. There is nothing new in this question. The Auditor General came forward and made a number of observations on how we could do an even better job and be more transparent to Parliament. We fully accept those recommendations.  \lineBreak What happened was that 32 projects were funded and all 32 of them came in on or under budget. All 32 projects were also supporting public infrastructure in the province of Ontario."
823,"Mr. Speaker, as usual, the  \lineBreak Is that why the minister is not allowed to answer the questions? Is it because he revealed that the Prime Minister's office was involved in the scandal.","Mr. Speaker, 32 projects were supported by Infrastructure Canada to support job creation and economic growth. They all came in on or under budget. There were 32 different contribution agreements for each of those projects that I approved. All of those projects provide good benefit to taxpayers now and will in the many years to come."
824,"Mr. Speaker, last week, the  \lineBreak The next budget will be under severe pressure for cutting these “soft services”. Could the minister give the House assurances that our vulnerable soldiers and their families will be protected from these budgetary pressures?","Mr. Speaker, my colleague is correct. My friend was in attendance, along with many members who are specifically tasked with how we deal with the scourge of post-traumatic stress and many of the challenges related to overseas deployments. \lineBreak  I am very pleased to report that Canada has in fact become a world leader in fighting the stigmatization and raising awareness of post-traumatic stress disorder and other operational stress injuries. As well, we have increased mental health awareness and we have increased the number of mental health professionals who are dealing specifically with these challenges."
825,"Mr. Speaker, the Province of British Columbia and its municipalities have pleaded with the government to come back to the table and negotiate a new RCMP contract in good faith. They are ready and willing to break the impasse, but the government would rather play hardball with the provinces and use our front-line officers as bargaining chips. \lineBreak Why is the government callously playing fast and loose with the safety of British Columbians and why will the ","Mr. Speaker, as you are well aware, there have been four years of intensive negotiations. Our government is willing to renew contract policing agreements with the provinces, and in fact I am awaiting the suggestions that the B.C. Solicitor General indicated that she would forward to my attention. To date I have not received that. She indicated on September 9 that she would be forwarding those suggestions. I have not heard from her."
826,"Mr. Speaker, the government cannot seem to get its story straight on this file. First the minister says there is a deadline and no more negotiations. Then on Friday, the member for  \lineBreak Which is it? Are the government members going to meet and negotiate, or are they going to complain that no one has told them what the issues are? \lineBreak Will the Conservatives stop trying to play good cop, bad cop and sit down and negotiate seriously with British Columbia so that front-line RCMP officers can focus on their real work, which is keeping our communities safe?","Mr. Speaker, it is quite surprising to hear the NDP members talking about keeping our communities safe when they have consistently voted against every single measure that would keep dangerous repeat offenders in prison. It is a shame that they would have the audacity to stand in the House and accuse this government, after all of the work that we have done to repair the damage that was done by the Liberals, for failing to train appropriate numbers of RCMP officers."
827,"Mr. Speaker, the killing continues in Syria and the Assad regime continues its slide into isolation.  \lineBreak The United Nations Security Council is meeting today to consider a resolution against Syria. Media reports indicate that it could be weakened. It may be blocked or even vetoed.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada is concerned about the ever-deteriorating situation in Syria and the plight of Syrian civilians. We will not wait for the United Nations to act. I am pleased to announce that we have expanded sanctions against the Syrian regime and its backers even further.  \lineBreak We will do our part to ensure that the full weight of the world is brought to bear on Assad and those who support him. We stand by the Syrian people in their hour of struggle."
828,"Mr. Speaker, suicide is the third-highest cause of death among adult men in Canada. Every day 10 Canadians take their own lives, and for every one suicide there are 100 attempts, with 23,000 hospitalizations a year. These high rates of mortality and morbidity surrounding suicidal behaviour constitute a major public health crisis. \lineBreak Since the federal government has already established national strategies in other critical areas such as cancer, does it not agree that suicide demands a similar multi-jurisdictional approach?","Mr. Speaker, as I have stated, we have made an investment in establishing the Mental Health Commission of Canada since we formed government. At the same time, we have made significant investments through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to address mental health illness, recognizing that there is not one answer to address suicide.  \lineBreak Our government has made a number of investments, as I outlined in my earlier response, but many of these initiatives are in addition to what we invest in supporting provinces and territories in delivering their health care. This is a collective effort that will continue."
829,"Mr. Speaker, a woman in my riding is dying from cancer while waiting for access to health insurance. To help her get access, we had to communicate with the department's consular affairs office, but it was impossible to get service in French. Yet the rules are clear, and I quote, “Ministers' offices...must have the capacity to communicate...in both official languages.”  \lineBreak Does this government respect our country's bilingualism and its obligation to provide services to its citizens, whatever their language?","Mr. Speaker, as the member should know, provinces and territories do deliver health care to their populations.  \lineBreak Our government provides support through the Canada Health Act and transfers to jurisdictions, as I have stated many times, but we have also made significant investments in the area of cancer prevention throughout Canada. We have renewed funding for the cancer partnerships across Canada."
830,"Mr. Speaker, thousands of law-abiding Canadians are being made to feel like criminals by the U.S. IRS. The  \lineBreak I thank the minister for his public stance against this assault on Canadian citizens. Will he now outline what specific measures he has taken to protect the life savings of this couple and others from the U.S. government's cash grab?","Mr. Speaker, we share the hon. member's concerns. It is absolutely unfair when hard-working, law-abiding Canadian citizens have misunderstood a U.S. law.  \lineBreak These are not high rollers. They are not avoiding taxes. We have called on the U.S. government to look upon these individuals with leniency and we have stressed that we will not, under our Canadian revenue agency, be collecting any of these supposed penalties."
831,"Mr. Speaker, the report by the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development is crystal clear: the Conservatives' so-called environmental plan will not enable Canada to meet its targets. And this situation is unlikely to change considering the mediocre data, which are insufficient to even assess the government's expenditures and efforts, combined with the elimination of environmental programs and the cuts to Environment Canada.  \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, again I lament the fact that the opposition will not recognize the positive remarks by the Auditor General's Commissioner of the Environment, but I must say that I was delighted that he acknowledged our international and national commitments to both Copenhagen and Cancun and our commitment to achieving a 17% reduction from 2005 base levels of greenhouse gases by 2020. \lineBreak Our government was elected to protect both the environment and the economy, and that is what it is doing."
832,"I would like to draw to the attention of hon. members the presence in the gallery of His Excellency Nassirou Bako-Arifari, Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Integration, Francophonie and the Beninese Abroad, of the Republic of Benin.","I would also like to draw to the attention of hon. members the presence in the gallery of the Honourable Mike Olscamp, Minister of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries for New Brunswick."
833,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' reckless policy of corporate tax cuts has helped gut our country's manufacturing sector. The Conservatives do not mind helping profitable oil companies and the big banks just love the handouts, but there has been no benefit for the manufacturing sector, and now we have lost hundreds of thousands of good jobs. Nowhere is this more evident than in Ontario, with even Mr. Hudak saying as much.  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, the government has been lowering taxes of all kinds for businesses, families and individuals. It is one of the reasons that Canada has a far better job creation record than most countries.  \lineBreak There are measures right now before the House of Commons to give specific tax allowances and specific tax breaks to the manufacturing sector. I would call on the NDP to support those and stop opposing good things for Canada's manufacturers."
834,"Mr. Speaker, those tax breaks to the big corporations are not working. The economic plan of the government is a failure. Jobs are not being created, pensions are not being protected and the stock markets are falling. This is a recipe for another Conservative recession and yet the  \lineBreak The fact is that two million Canadians are looking for jobs. Why are they not the priority instead of the big banks?","Mr. Speaker, we are concerned about Canadians out of work, which is why job creation is our priority and why we have the results to show for it. \lineBreak  What I do not understand is that when we put job creation measures before the House, such as the new tax credit for new hires and incentives for manufacturers, why the NDP, which apparently has no economic ideas at all to propose, just simply stands in the way and votes against these things for Canadian families. "
835,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' industrial and fiscal policies have benefited the big oil companies and hurt manufacturing industries, especially in Ontario, where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been eliminated in this sector. The way in which the they are developing the oil sands, without including the environmental costs, has thrown our economy out of balance by artificially inflating the value of our dollar and hurting our exports. Workers in the manufacturing sector have been hit hard by the bad decisions of the Conservatives. \lineBreak When will they restore the balance and put people back to work? That is a concrete suggestion.","Mr. Speaker, unemployment clearly remains a difficult problem, but this country's job creation record is better than that of many other countries because of this government's economic action plan. The House of Commons has before it proposals that would create jobs: a tax credit for new hires and tax reductions for businesses and manufacturers. \lineBreak I do not understand why the NDP opposes these proposals, which will greatly assist our businesses and our families."
836,"Mr. Speaker, today, the  \lineBreak From now on, hundreds of thousands of workers will have to pay to cross when crossing is currently free. Why?","Mr. Speaker, this bridge is a major asset for the country, and the commitment that the  \lineBreak The government's preferred option to ensure viable infrastructure for future generations currently involves tolls and a public-private partnership."
837,"Mr. Speaker, it is funny. Every time I hear the Conservatives talking about a public-private partnership, I get the impression that they really mean a partnership that will line the pockets of the private sector or one that will make the public pay. \lineBreak Hundreds of thousands of people will pay out of their own pockets for a toll bridge when it costs nothing to cross the existing bridge. The government needs to tell the public why.","Mr. Speaker, the mayor of Montreal said: \lineBreak I could also quote Michel Leblanc, Françoise Bertrand, the Conseil du patronat du Québec and others. We understand that the NDP does not do business with the private sector; perhaps it hates doing so. But we want to keep our promises and ensure that sustainable infrastructure is built for Canada's future generations."
838,"Mr. Speaker, there is no bridge and no plan. All we have is an announcement. There is a difference. The problem we see is that the Government of Quebec was not there for the announcement, and if there is a public transit aspect, it is absolutely essential to have the full co-operation of the Province of Quebec. \lineBreak How does the ","Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak We will work with our partners in the public and private sectors to get the new bridge built."
839,"Mr. Speaker, it is now 118 days since the  \lineBreak The Information Commissioner says that she is worried about the use of private emails to cover the tracks of ministers. The government is a black hole of accountability and the President of the Treasury Board is at the centre of this hole. \lineBreak Will he stand up in the House today and explain why the Auditor General was misled?","Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General had full access to all of the information pertaining to 32 public infrastructure projects that all benefited municipalities, provincial and community infrastructure. She came forward and made some observations on how we could do a better job to be even more transparent to Parliament, and we have completely accepted her good advice."
840,"Mr. Speaker, if it were that simple the  \lineBreak This is about accountability. Accountable ministers do not try to pull a fast one on the Auditor General. Accountable ministers do not tell mayors to keep their mouths shut until they get their stories straight. Accountable ministers stand up in the House of Commons and explain themselves. \lineBreak The ","Mr. Speaker, here are the facts: 32 projects were supported by Infrastructure Canada; 32 projects were built; 32 projects came in on time and on budget; 32 projects all in the public sector are now at the disposal and benefit of the province, the community and municipalities in that region."
841,"Mr. Speaker, if only the member for  \lineBreak We have learned that the mayor of Huntsville is clearly embarrassed by the email exchange between him and the President of the Treasury Board. \lineBreak Can the minister stand and explain to us how these emails prove that the Prime Minister's Office was involved? How they prove that the minister wanted to block a spending review? Does the President of the Treasury Board agree with the mayor of Huntsville that Bell Canada stocks will go up when politicians like him learn to use the telephone to hide their unsavoury activities?","Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak to the issue involving the mayor of Huntsville. \lineBreak This government expanded the access to information laws. We tried to bring more light and more accountability to public corporations like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Canadian Wheat Board. The first time in Canadian history a party stood up and voted to bring the cloak of darkness back on a public corporation and it was the NDP that did that with the Canadian Wheat Board."
842,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak The mayor of Huntsville learned his lesson: if you are planning some funny business, make sure you cover your tracks. The Information Commissioner is justifiably worried about that statement and the fact that the minister is determined to cover his tracks. \lineBreak Does the President of the Treasury Board believe that he, too, needs to learn how to better hide the truth?","Mr. Speaker, I never get tired of answering questions from the New Democratic Party in the House. It is always a great privilege to serve Canadians. \lineBreak It was this government that expanded the access to information laws. There are access to information laws at the provincial and municipal levels. The fact that all of these email exchanges were released shows just how open and transparent things are."
843,"Mr. Speaker, once again, the United States is planning to impose a special tariff on Canadian businesses. This time, an extra $140 will be charged on each container carrying goods from British Columbia when cargo ships dock in the United States. This news came to light on the eve of the announcement of a co-operation agreement between the two countries. \lineBreak Will the government stand up to our American neighbour and refuse this latest attack on our trade interests?","Mr. Speaker, any new tax is a bad idea as it raises costs on consumers. \lineBreak Canada's ports and railways are competing fairly. The Asia-Pacific gateway initiative that the member refers to is working as intended. \lineBreak We will defend Canada's competitive advantage wherever it is threatened. I have made this clear to FMC Commissioner Lidinsky as well as to my USTR counterpart Ambassador Kirk. "
844,"Mr. Speaker, first the U.S. slapped protectionist buy American provisions into the American jobs act. Now the Conservatives claim to be “monitoring the situation” while the U.S. moves forward with a punitive $140 tariff on goods coming through B.C. ports. Seventy-five billion dollars worth of annual trade and 130,000 jobs are at stake. \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, I would encourage that member to visit my part of the country to see what is actually going on there. \lineBreak While the member opposite engages in unhelpful rhetoric, both my parliamentary secretary as well as the chairman of the international trade committee are on the ground in Washington, D.C. today raising this very issue with their counterparts. \lineBreak Unlike the member opposite, we will continue to promote Canada's competitive advantage and aggressively pursue the elimination of trade barriers."
845,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are cutting border services to sign a $1 billion perimeter security deal with the U.S. \lineBreak From softwood lumber to the buy American act, every time the Conservatives negotiate a deal across the border, Canadians lose out, on jobs, the environment, natural resources and privacy. \lineBreak The government has a proven track record of being very bad negotiators. How can Canadians trust the government? What is on the table this time?","Mr. Speaker, on May 2 Canadians gave the government a very strong mandate to focus on economic growth and the creation of jobs. Our focus is on removing trade barriers, not erecting new ones. I wish the member would join us as we stand up for Canadians."
846,"Mr. Speaker, based on the report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, it is clear that the government is failing on climate change. \lineBreak The government has lowered expected climate change reductions by 90% since 2007. If the minister believes that we are seeing the impacts of climate change, then why is the government failing so miserably on combating climate change?","Mr. Speaker, the commissioner knows, as my colleague should, that the Kyoto protocol, which was one of the greatest blunders of the previous Liberal government, was in Canada's rear view mirror. \lineBreak The commissioner recognized yesterday that Canada has new international commitments to the Cancun agreements and the Copenhagen accord. We do have a climate change plan. I am delighted that the commissioner recognizes it."
847,"Mr. Speaker, what is in the rear view mirror is Canada's credibility. \lineBreak The government is making cuts to areas such as climate impacts and adaptation, environmental assessment, and ozone monitoring. We do not expect these to be the last. The government is also cutting air quality measurements necessary for monitoring the oil sands. \lineBreak How can the government deliver a comprehensive oil sands monitoring system when there will be fewer scientists to monitor it?","Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to compare, any day, our government's record on the environment with that of the previous Liberal government, which did nothing but pay lip service to its professed commitment to the environment. \lineBreak I would remind the member again, and I am disappointed that my colleague fails to recognize, the commissioner's positive words when he says, with regard to oil sands monitoring:"
848,"Mr. Speaker, the environment commissioner has again reported on the abject--",Order. The hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona has the floor. Order.
849,"Mr. Speaker, the environment commissioner has again reported on the abject failure of the government to require industry to assess the cumulative impacts of the oil sands on air, water, fish and wildlife. \lineBreak Contrary to the recent outrageous comment by the  \lineBreak Is anyone in the government willing to step up to the plate, restore the honour of the Crown and ensure aboriginal and treaty rights are not further abrogated?","Mr. Speaker, my department officials have been working closely with the communities that are near the Athabasca oil sands to make sure the aboriginal interests are accommodated. Along with industry we have entered into many co-operative and collaborative arrangements. We continue to do that and we think that this is a good working arrangement."
850,"Mr. Speaker, the commissioner also criticized the government for basing decisions about the oil sands on incomplete, poor, or non-existent environmental information. \lineBreak The Alberta government has finally agreed to help finance a long overdue health study for at least two of the impacted aboriginal communities. Last I checked, this is a clear federal responsibility.  \lineBreak How does the government justify more tax breaks for the polluters while turning its back on aboriginal communities?","Mr. Speaker, we are well aware of the work that the Alberta government has entered into. We think this is a good thing. This is a shared responsibility in many respects. We continue to work on a trilateral basis with the province and aboriginal groups. We think this is a good move forward."
851,"Mr. Speaker, on July 22 our government pledged $50 million in additional support to those suffering from famine in the Horn of Africa, bringing Canada's total commitment to $72 million. At that time, the minister also announced that our government would match eligible donations from Canadians until September 16. \lineBreak Would the minister give the House an update on what our government is doing to help those affected by the humanitarian crisis in East Africa?","Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right. Canada is doing its part to help the 13 million affected in East Africa. \lineBreak Canadians again have shown their compassion and generosity. Individual Canadians have donated over $70 million to Canadian organizations. As promised, the government will match their generosity through the African drought relief fund. This brings our government support to $142 million to provide needed food, medicine, nutrition and clean water."
852,"Mr. Speaker, as of last month, the Arctic Ocean's layer of ice had never been so thin. In his report, the environment commissioner said that the government's so-called action plan is not working. Programs are being cut and critical information is lacking. Climate change is a reality, but the government is in denial. \lineBreak In three years there have been three reports and three ministers, but no action. Why?","Mr. Speaker, our government complies fully with the reporting requirements of the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act, but there is no obligation in this act for financial reporting.  \lineBreak The Government of Canada reports to Parliament on all expenditures related to climate change, for example, through individual departmental performance reports. \lineBreak We will not file redundant reports. We will protect the environment and Canadians' hard-earned tax dollars. That is what we were elected to do."
853,"Mr. Speaker, we have seen the plan, and the plan is failing. Maybe the minister would prefer to talk about streamlining Environment Canada, or optimizing Arctic sea ice, or perhaps redistributing the hole in the ozone layer. However, the reality is that the government's out-of-touch environmental policies are putting Canadians at risk. \lineBreak Will the minister get beyond his rhetoric and agree to all of the environment commissioner's recommendations for improvement?","Mr. Speaker, the environment commissioner conceded before the House committee yesterday that his report was fully a year out of date. Unfortunately, my colleague had left the committee room at that point. \lineBreak Again, I lament the fact that she fails to recognize the positive words the environment commissioner offered, both on our monitoring plans for the water, the air and the biodiversity of the Lower Athabasca and our commitment to the Copenhagen and Cancun accords. \lineBreak We have a plan. He recognizes it."
854,"Mr. Speaker, Canada is falling way behind on its international commitment to establish marine-protected areas by 2012. The Pacific north coast integrated management area process brought together first nations, fishermen, environmentalists and industry to make a joint plan for stewardship of our ocean resources. The government invested in this process and then suddenly pulled the plug. \lineBreak Why has the government walked away from a plan to protect the economic, social and environmental health of our oceans?","Mr. Speaker, this government remains fully committed to developing an integrated management plan for the Pacific north coast by December 2012. Our goal is to develop a plan that is relevant and effective for the specific area, using an approach that is consistent with similar large oceans management areas. It is our intention to continue to work closely with first nations and the province of British Columbia, which have been valuable partners in the planning process."
855,"Mr. Speaker, why does the government have such a hard time co-operating with others? The funding agreement was supported by all levels of government and first nations, but after lobbying from its oil patch buddies, the government suddenly announced it is walking away.  \lineBreak Everyone else wants a strong plan to protect our oceans. When will the government come back to the table and get serious about ocean management?","Mr. Speaker, there is no question that we are responsible about ocean management. We have committed to the plan for the Pacific north coast by December 2012. We will make that commitment and work with our partners in the process. "

858,"Mr. Speaker, in the budget a targeted area of R and D under the eco-energy innovation initiative is advanced energy storage: batteries. The National Research Council is undergoing a big reorganization. Scientists are waiting to learn if they have a future at NRC, including lithium ion battery researchers, whose contracts are ending in a few months. \lineBreak Would the government please encourage NRC to quickly clarify the future of this group to retain our scientific resources and align them with Canada's economic priorities?","Mr. Speaker, no government in the history of Canada has invested so much in science and technology. The reason we are doing that is that discoveries, when they move to market, create jobs. They create better jobs. They create higher-paying jobs and improve the quality of life for all Canadians, and that is exactly what this government will continue to do."
859,"Mr. Speaker, the government must take action to protect workers' pension plans. \lineBreak In 2010, Fraser Papers in Thurso declared bankruptcy and 800 workers lost 40% of their pensions. The same thing is happening elsewhere in Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick. \lineBreak The NDP's policy is clear. Pensions represent earnings saved by workers and they must be paid in full. \lineBreak How many workers will have to lose their pensions before the government will change the law to protect retirees like those from Fraser Papers?","Mr. Speaker, we actually did put forward legislation to help protect those pensions that the hon. member is referring to. We reformed the framework for those pensions that are under federal jurisdiction. As we all know, the federal government actually only mandates regulations for 7%.  \lineBreak We encourage the provinces to follow our lead to help to make sure that we protect those pensions that seniors expect to retire with."
860,"Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government is committed to keeping our streets and our communities safe. Part of that obviously means that we have a correctional system that actually corrects offenders. Our government has taken strong actions by improving offender accountability methods through the  \lineBreak  However, some so-called criminal rights advocates oppose this approach. Yesterday at the public safety committee, they spoke strongly against our Conservative plan to establish drug-free prisons.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the member. \lineBreak  Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. Our government has a zero tolerance policy for drugs in our institutions. We reject suggestions from those who, like the NDP and its far-left comrades, continuously put the rights of criminals ahead of the rights of law-abiding Canadians. \lineBreak We will continue to take action to fulfill our campaign commitment to ensure drug-free prisons."
861,"Mr. Speaker, once again, this government is demonstrating that when it comes to youth, it prefers to adopt a repressive approach instead of encouraging them to reintegrate into society. Every year since 2002, under the supervision of artist Jean Beaulieu, the Art-Go project has allowed 35 high school dropouts from the Trois-Rivières area to regain their self-confidence by learning how to make stained glass windows. Ninety per cent of the program participants go back to school or join the workforce. But this government has decided to cut funding to Art-Go at the same time as it is buying stained glass windows for the Senate. \lineBreak Why is this government refusing to continue funding a project that works?","Mr. Speaker, our government has done a lot to help youth develop the skills they need to enter the workforce. There are programs to teach them how to apply for a job, how to go through an interview and how to work in an office or elsewhere. \lineBreak We will continue to help youth prepare for the workforce. These programs are very popular and, unfortunately, not all programs can receive funding."
862,"Mr. Speaker, all economic players in Quebec, employers and workers alike, agree on one thing: Quebec's shipyards must get a significant chunk of the billions of dollars worth of shipbuilding contracts that the federal government is about to grant. Unfortunately, the only ones who refuse to take a clear stand on this issue in favour of Quebec's economy are the Conservative and NDP members from Quebec.  \lineBreak My question is simple: can that the ","Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the member that this is an arm's-length competitive process that is managed by the shipbuilding secretariat. It is the one that is evaluating the bids and it will determine the winners based on the merits of their proposals. \lineBreak As the member knows, the process is under way to select the winning shipyards. Neither the federal cabinet nor any politician will be involved in this decision, and this procurement is under the careful watch of two high-level interdepartmental governance committees, a fairness monitor and an international third party benchmarking firm. I should tell the House that to date the fairness monitor says that the process is fair and transparent."
863,"Mr. Speaker, given the ","Mr. Speaker, the actions of the government are always open to scrutiny and debate. Because the opposition loses the debate does not mean we did not have a debate.  \lineBreak The government is still in discussions with the United States. However, unlike the other parties, we think it is critical to the Canadian economy that we have trade with the U.S., we secure access to our market, and we ensure our mutual security. \lineBreak I know the NDP is against that and the Liberal Party has no position on it, but these are critical things for Canadians."
864,"Mr. Speaker, I did not hear an answer to the second question. Perhaps I could hear an answer to this one. \lineBreak Could the  \lineBreak Why would the Prime Minister be signing this deal when all these issues are still very much on the table? ","Mr. Speaker, first of all, some of the things the leader said in his preamble are not correct. In terms of the specific negotiations with the United States, we do not have an agreement yet, but we continue to work on it. \lineBreak Only a former leader of the NDP would say that when we face American protectionism, the solution to that is to cut our own access off to the American market."
865,"Mr. Speaker, the government did not get a mandate to give away our sovereignty. Canadians do not agree with that. \lineBreak  According to reports, Canadian officials are heading to Washington this weekend to beg for the U.S. government to hold a public signing ceremony for the deal. The Conservatives cannot even negotiate a signing ceremony, but claim they can negotiate a good deal for Canadians. \lineBreak Concerns have been raised repeatedly about protecting the privacy of Canadians and also the thickening of our border, yet the government is more worried about a photo op with Barack Obama. Why will the government not come clean on its secret security deal?","Mr. Speaker, the government is committed to working for jobs. \lineBreak It is committed to working with our American partners, with the Obama administration, to make it easier for jobs and employment growth. Reports that are in the media about a deal being accomplished are inaccurate. \lineBreak Work on this important action plan is ongoing. When a final deal is reached, we will be sure to let the member for "

874,"Mr. Speaker, taxpayers deserve better than an out of touch government that believes it does not have to follow the rules. \lineBreak Since 2006, the Conservatives have spent more than $10 million on press conferences, not to mention the travel expenses of ministers who jet across the country to eat lobster. There are two press rooms on Parliament Hill, and ministers can make announcements at any time in the House of Commons. \lineBreak Why is this government wasting so much taxpayers' money on self-promotion?","Mr. Speaker, the government is actually quite proud to share with Canadians all of the suggestions we have put out, all of the ideas and all of the programs we have brought forward in a number of budgets. \lineBreak It is our role to make sure that Canadians are aware. Along with our partners we made sure Canadians were aware of, for example, the home renovation tax credit. We had to make sure Canadians knew about that so they could apply for it. We need to make sure that Canadians are aware of the children's arts tax credit that is coming forward now."

It has done an even worse job on patronage than the Liberals did. Some defeated candidates were appointed to the Senate, others were rewarded with government jobs, and the failed Conservative candidate in Mount Royal was hired as a ministerial adviser.

There will finally be a new Champlain Bridge that will be sustainable for future generations and affordable for Canadian taxpayers. That is what is important."
887,"Mr. Speaker, the government's vague announcement is going to hurt Montreal families right in their pocketbooks. First, it decided to ding commuters every time they go to work; then, it saddles taxpayers with a cost overrun we know will come from these risky private ventures. \lineBreak  Could the minister tell this House who will own the bridge? Does he even know how much these tolls will cost? Will the government have any say?

That is important. So, the federal government is going to spend $5 billion on the bridge, while, at the same time, further down the same road, the provincial government is spending $3 billion on the Turcot project.  \lineBreak Will the Conservatives work in partnership with Quebec for more public transit, or is $8 billion going to be spent to wind up with the same congestion problems?

In other words, companies will have two years before they have to adjust to the new labelling rules. I do not find these regulations particularly energetic or very beneficial for our adolescents. \lineBreak Why did the government give in to the interests of the industry and bring forward such a weak plan?","Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, we carefully looked at all the recommendations coming from the expert panel, as well as a number of other sources.

If we do not act now, we will be shut out of our own waters. \lineBreak Has the government been involved in setting these environmental standards, or has it given up our Arctic waters and our Arctic sovereignty to the United States?","Mr. Speaker, we have ongoing discussions with our neighbours to the south on this and other issues that are important to the Arctic. \lineBreak Obviously, this government will always stand up for Canadian sovereignty and fight for what is right.

The government claims it does not want to reopen the same-sex marriage debate, but that is exactly what it is doing by disputing the definition of a civil partnership.

We have done nothing to reopen that debate. We respect the decision by Parliament, but it is a question of definitions, and that is being argued before the courts. We are intervenors, as are a number of other individuals and organizations, and I look forward to the court's decision."
899,"Mr. Speaker, the disability insurance plan is not fulfilling its mandate. People with serious disabilities cannot access it. Over the past five years, more than half the disability insurance claims have been rejected, and half of these people still do not have a job three years later. The program evaluation report indicates that 48% of beneficiaries live below the poverty line. \lineBreak Will the government undertake to improve support for the disabled and put an end to this injustice?","Mr. Speaker, our government has done more than any other government to help the disabled. For example, we signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and we introduced the disability savings plan.

901,"Mr. Speaker, the people of Charlevoix and Haute-Côte-Nord have been hard hit by the economic downturn and seriously penalized by the termination of the employment insurance transitional measures. The minister has to understand that these measures were brought in because the economic reality and the labour market in these regions were not the same as in the Lower St. Lawrence and the north shore. By terminating these measures, the Conservatives are ignoring the reality in the regions and showing that they do not have a plan to help workers. \lineBreak When will the government extend the employment insurance transitional measures?","Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member said, these measures were transitional. The purpose of these measures was to help people who were having a great deal of difficulty finding a job because the unemployment rate where they lived was much higher than in other areas. For some time now, the unemployment rate in the region has been identical or comparable to other areas. The transitional measures are therefore no longer necessary. These people have the same opportunities as others in the area."
902,"Mr. Speaker, on one hand, the government is negotiating a secret security perimeter agreement worth $1 billion to make the Americans happy. On the other, the government is reducing the hours of border crossings and customs offices or even closing them, which has negatively affected security, the economy and tourism in dozens of communities close to Jamieson's Line, Franklin Centre, Côte-de-Liesse, Morses Line, Drummondville, East Pinnacle, Granby, Glen Sutton and Port-Cartier. \lineBreak How can the minister justify these cuts, which are hitting the people who use these services hard, when it can find $1 billion for the Americans?","Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of our ongoing initiatives with respect to our discussions on free trade and security with the Americans. \lineBreak We are also looking at ports of entry across the country, those on the 49th parallel and elsewhere. We believe that Canadians expect us to handle their money appropriately. \lineBreak We are looking at the situation, and in cases where it is no longer justified to have those border crossings open, they will not be open."
903,"Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to ask the  \lineBreak Furthermore, my hon. colleagues know as well as I do that, for the second time in two weeks, the government is using a guillotine to cut off the normal debate process in our Parliament. We find this extremely worrisome, since it has become quite common with this government. Now that they have a majority, the Conservatives' contempt for Parliament is clear. I would also like the  \lineBreak The government is using the term “enough debate”. For the second time in two weeks, it is using a guillotine to cut off the normal work of parliament that we were elected by Canadians to do. \lineBreak Bill  \lineBreak  I would like, on behalf of all Canadians and the House, to understand when, in the opinion of the majority Conservatives, there has been enough debate.","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in response to the question.  \lineBreak I want to start by extending my best wishes to the opposition House leader. I fear that this may be my last Thursday question from him, as I understand he might be embarking on new endeavours during the next week. We have worked together exceedingly well, to the surprise of many, I might say, and perhaps even to the disappointment of some. In any event, it is fair to say we have exceeded everyone's expectations in that regard.  \lineBreak Should it turn out that someone else asks next Thursday's question, allow me to offer him the best of luck. I know he is a determined competitor in every endeavour he undertakes and that he will still be around here, though perhaps in a somewhat different role. \lineBreak As for the business of the House in the coming week, we will continue debating the keeping Canada's economy and jobs growing act this afternoon. That bill is designed to include many measures that were discussed in the last budget and the previous election, such as the small business hiring tax credit, extending the accelerated capital cost allowance for investments in manufacturing equipment, creating a new family caregiver tax credit, forgiving loans for new doctors and nurses in underserved areas and introducing a new children's arts tax credit for music, dance and art lessons. \lineBreak Further to the motion adopted in the House this morning, the government will continue with the third and fourth days of debate on this bill on Friday. Then we will be in our constituencies for a week and we will return on the following Monday. \lineBreak The House leader has asked me how much time is enough when we are doing the work we were elected by Canadians to do. The work we were elected by Canadians to do was to actually deliver on that budget and its terms that were discussed during the election campaign across the country earlier this year in the same fashion as our commitment to deliver on our tackling crime bill. The tackling crime bill was part of our commitment that we undertook to deliver to Canadians, and we intend to do that. \lineBreak This bill will have been debated more than the average time at second reading than a typical average budget bill in the last 20 years, in fact more time than for any budget bill under a majority government during the past two decades, which I believe were Liberal majority governments. \lineBreak On Tuesday, October 18, we will begin debate on the copyright modernization act.  \lineBreak In terms of the next allotted day, I will at some point allot that. We have not yet taken a decision on that. \lineBreak In closing, let me wish all members a happy Thanksgiving. I know the opposition House leader in particular will put that week to great benefit."
904,"Mr. Speaker, Majeed Uddin Ahmed, a Canadian citizen, together with his wife and their two Canadian children, ages five and one and a half, have been arrested and incarcerated in Saudi Arabia's notorious Dhaban prison for two weeks. One of the children is sick and requires medical care. \lineBreak From the beginning, the minister was made aware of this situation. The family in Canada has been advised that it will have to wait until next week for news as officials have told them, “It is not in our route of travel”. \lineBreak When will the minister order her officials to change their travel plans and bring these kids home?","Mr. Speaker, we are in fact aware of reports of this family being detained in Saudi Arabia. Canadian officials have been working, and will continue to work, with local authorities to receive formal confirmation of the family's present situation.  \lineBreak In addition, consular officials are seeking, if there is confirmation of the family's detention, to have consular access with the family. We are in constant daily contact with the family here in Canada and we will continue to work for the well-being of this family."
905,"Mr. Speaker, the government has announced it is closing search and rescue centres in Quebec City and St. John's.  \lineBreak Staffing and infrastructure requirements are just some of the concerns raised by departmental officials in a recently obtained internal government document which shows that the Coast Guard would have to absorb the transitional costs without any new government funding. \lineBreak We are dealing with an essential service and human lives. Will the government do the right thing and reverse this reckless decision?","Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times, the consolidation represents a positive change by locating all maritime and air search and rescue coordinators in the same centre working side by side. \lineBreak This change does not affect the availability of resources such as Coast Guard ships or Coast Guard auxiliary and Canadian Forces aircraft. \lineBreak The consolidation of the sub-centres into existing joint rescue coordination centres will have no negative impact on the current levels of service provided by the Coast Guard."
906,"Mr. Speaker, the issue is that the minister is being contradicted by his own officials. In the document obtained, they warn about the lack of French outside Quebec City's rescue centre. I would like to read from the document in English: \lineBreak “A number of senior team members have expressed doubt and concern about the success of closing MRSC Quebec et al”. \lineBreak How would the minister feel if he were in danger and had to communicate in a language he did not understand? Will he listen to his own advisers and leave the rescue centres where they are so that they can save lives?","Mr. Speaker, many times I have indicated that bilingual capacity will be increased above the levels that are in place now both in Halifax and Trenton. \lineBreak This is not an issue. There is no way we will jeopardize the safety of mariners. We will continue on course as we have been to save money and provide better efficiencies."
907,"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to respond to a point of order that was raised by the member for  \lineBreak I have reviewed the transcript of what I said during statements that day and the transcript of the point of order raised shortly afterward by my hon. colleague. Clearly, the comments that I made were in reference to the recent second reading vote on the safe streets and communities act, which the member himself opposed. I believe that after careful consideration, Mr. Speaker, you would find that the comments I made in no way accused the member of supporting criminals or criminality and did not impugn his character, as suggested in his point of order. \lineBreak I am aware that this is a sensitive and sometimes personal topic for many Canadians. However, I do stand by my comment made on September 29, that by opposing the safe streets and communities act the member and all of those who joined him in voting against the act were in fact putting their constituents at risk by maintaining the status quo. \lineBreak I would encourage the member and his party to reflect on the important measures contained in our bill and to change his vote in support of the safe streets and communities act at report stage and third reading in the coming weeks.","I appreciate the hon. member assuring the House that he was not impugning anybody's character. I would ask all members, especially during S. O. 31s, to err on the side of civility when they are making their statements, especially when they are singling out a particular member. \lineBreak I thank the member for "
908,"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Having been elected to this place for a number of years, I am aware of a lot of the traditions in the House. When an individual refers to a document, particularly an internal government document, it is only fair that the document be tabled in the House. \lineBreak I am sure the minister meant well, but he indicated that all was well with cutting the search and rescue centres in Quebec City and St. John's. This document will explain to the minister, to members of the House and to the general public the danger to safety that is involved with these closures.  \lineBreak I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to table this document so we will all be aware of the dangers of closing the search and rescue centres in Quebec City and St. John's.",Does the hon. member for 
909,"Mr. Speaker, the government is violating the rights of Parliament by forcing the passage of its omnibus crime bill without debate. In fact, a number of aspects of this bill are very debatable. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the government's estimates of the costs have no rhyme or reason. They are not based on any specific methodology or verifiable information, and they do not take provincial costs into account. \lineBreak When will this government finally be honest with the provinces? When will it finally be honest with Canadians about the real cost of its so-called law and order agenda?","Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the cost of crime on Canadian society far exceeds the cost of fighting crime. The fact is that last spring we provided the committee with hundreds of pages of documents that go into precise detail on costing. \lineBreak For the hon. member's benefit, the  \lineBreak We are working with our provincial and territorial partners on these costs. We believe that working in collaboration with them is important to ensure a strong justice system."
910,"Mr. Speaker, it cost some $73 million for a website. Are we to believe that is the real cost? \lineBreak Members know that this government loves to hand out cheques written on other people's money. With respect to the provincial costs of the bill, the Parliamentary Budget Officer—a man of authority who is neutral, independent and credible, and who is never wrong, whereas the government always tries to ram false information down our throats—is accusing the government of obstruction. Quebec does not seem too worried because it said this morning that it will be asking the federal government to reimburse every dollar. \lineBreak What will this government do?","Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that the Department of Justice study in 2008 tagged the cost of crime on society at almost $100 billion in that year alone. That it was borne by victims by 83% is what we are concerned about mostly. \lineBreak Since our government took office, support payments to the provinces have increased by 30%, or $12.7 billion. In budget 2010-11, we announced transfer payments to the provinces and territories of $54 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion over last year."
911,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have always boasted they would not download to the provinces. That is exactly what this is. No one believes them, especially not the highly credible Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is always right whenever they are trying to give false information. \lineBreak Now they want Canadians to believe that their massive prison agenda will cost no more than their website. Nobody believes them. Canadians do not buy it, the PBO certainly does not and the government knows it is hiding the true cost to the provinces of the downloading of the prison expenses. \lineBreak Provinces want more front-line police, not a bill for more prisons that the Conservatives dictated. When will the government come clean with the provinces on the true cost of its prison agenda?","Mr. Speaker, it would be refreshing if just for once the opposition members would really look at the cost of crime on the victims and on law-abiding Canadians. \lineBreak We are following through on our commitment to help victims of crime, particularly those most vulnerable, the children in our society, and to protect them from those who would traffic in illegal drugs. \lineBreak We would love it if the opposition would get on board with these initiatives to help those who are the most vulnerable in society."
912,"Mr. Speaker, last week opposition MPs tried to get the public accounts committee to study past Auditor General reports. \lineBreak Conservatives forced the meeting behind closed doors, an assault on transparency and accountability. Now it turns out this committee did not adopt a motion to deal with these important issues on government waste and mismanagement. \lineBreak The Conservative member for  \lineBreak Do Conservatives object to the Auditor General's past reports being studied?","Mr. Speaker, as we all know, committees are masters of their own destiny, but I would say this: right now our government is engaged in an effort to try to reduce government spending and reduce the size of government, and every step of the way it is the opposition members who are objecting to that. \lineBreak We appreciate the efforts of the Auditor General to assist us in providing reports that help us to find examples of government waste.  \lineBreak We know we want to eliminate them. We know we want to reduce government spending. We know that every time we try to do it, those guys get upset. They are objecting to our efforts to cut down on spending."
913,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives continue to hide the truth from Canadians. An opposition motion to study the Auditor General's previous reports was not adopted by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts: reports on cost overruns for military helicopters, the $500,000 severance paid to the integrity commissioner, and mismanaged renovations on Parliament Hill. \lineBreak The Conservative member for  \lineBreak Why will this government not let the Standing Committee on Public Accounts do its work? What does it have to hide?","Mr. Speaker, once again, the committees determine their own agendas. They determine their work program and they are, of course, doing that with an objective of reducing government spending. We appreciate the work of the Auditor General, because the Auditor General has been very helpful to us in providing recommendations on which we have relied in order to eliminate waste in government. That is what we want to do on this side of the House.  \lineBreak It is very interesting that New Democrats are raising these concerns, because usually they object to every effort we make to eliminate waste and to keep the cost and size of government under control.  \lineBreak We will continue to do that and we appreciate the help of the Auditor General in providing us information that helps us achieve that objective of respecting taxpayers' dollars above all else."
914,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for that question, because it gives me the opportunity to report just how our budgets, from past budgets to the budgets that are coming forward, are actually helping Canadians in a variety of ways, including the measures that were mentioned by my colleague.  \lineBreak In fact, thanks to our budget, I can report today that we have learned that over 60,000 jobs have been created, which brings the total number of jobs to approximately 650,000 since pre-crisis levels.  \lineBreak That is a fantastic budget from the past to the future. We will continue our progress."
915,"Mr. Speaker, two days after the announcement of the construction of a new Champlain Bridge, south shore and Montreal families are still in the dark. They do not know exactly when they will have a safe bridge or how much it will cost. All they know is that they are going to have to bear the financial burden of the bridge. \lineBreak Why does this government want to penalize families and workers who have no choice but to use the Champlain Bridge?","Mr. Speaker, this week, the "
916,"Mr. Speaker, the Champlain Bridge is a vital route for south shore and Montreal families. The bridge is free to cross but the Conservatives want to make people pay to use it. \lineBreak When will this government pay attention to all Canadians instead of just to those who have the means to be heard?","Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank the hon. member because it was his idea to have a toll system. He said, “In terms of tolls, it's still to be seen. Like we've always said, we're open.” He also said, “With regard to the Champlain Bridge's replacement, we're not dismissing the idea of tolls.” He had a good idea: to implement a toll. We listened to him and used his idea. I congratulate him, but now I would like to know why he has changed his mind. "
917,"Mr. Speaker, the government still refuses to say whether a viable public transit plan will be part of the new Champlain Bridge. First it is making Montreal and the south shore families foot the bill, and now it is ignoring 18,000 public transit passengers who cross that bridge each day. \lineBreak The government members are so out of touch with the needs of Montreal and the south shore, we have to wonder whether they have ever been there. Why will the government not commit to a vital public transit plan for the Champlain Bridge?","Mr. Speaker, here is another NDP member with an excellent idea. The NDP transport critic, the hon. member who just spoke on the matter, has said, and I quote, “...as a party, we are not against PPPs”. He also said that in some cases tolls make sense. I congratulate him again on these great ideas. We listened to him and we thank him for giving his opinion on the matter. "
918,"Mr. Speaker, that is not exactly the answer I was looking for. I was talking about public transit. \lineBreak Why has the government not made any plans for public transit on the new Champlain Bridge? Every day, 400 buses carry 18,000 passengers across the bridge. There is a great demand. The minister keeps saying that it is a provincial responsibility, while repeating that the project is 100% federal. When will this government adopt a plan for public transit?","Mr. Speaker, prior to the announcement made by our great minister, the NDP had suggested a toll system to pay for the Champlain Bridge. That is why many people are now saying that the new name for the NDP should be “new duty to pay”. So I would like to thank the NDP member for suggesting this excellent idea. In the end, it is the Conservatives who are taking action and getting results for Montrealers and Canadians."
919,"Mr. Speaker, it has been a tough week for the  \lineBreak When will the government recognize this?","Mr. Speaker, we do not agree with the energy directive that has come out from the EU. \lineBreak We are going to continue to work to represent and to protect Canadian oil sands interests and Canadian economic interests. We will stand with the workers. We will stand with the industry. We are going to protect the environment at the same time."
920,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the  \lineBreak Would the minister please table in this House a list of these so-called responsible journalists so we can know to whom the government is actually talking about its failed environmental plans?","Mr. Speaker, our government is squarely focused on what matters to Canadians: jobs, economic growth and protecting the environment. \lineBreak We are proud of the work of our scientists within Environment Canada. Ministers speak for the environment. That is what is laid out in our communication policy, and that is why we take questions in question period."
921,"Mr. Speaker, in September, a 23-year-old woman was fatally shot on the Samson Cree Nation. She was killed in the house next door to where five-year-old Ethan Yellowbird was killed just two months earlier. \lineBreak Youth gangs are responsible for the increasing violence in a community where youth are disaffected and hopeless. \lineBreak If the government is truly sincere about assisting the most vulnerable, why does it persist in spending billions on prisons instead of investing in programs to prevent youth crime in first nations?","Mr. Speaker, the member talked about the situation with the Samson Cree. I did meet with the chief. He has been collaborating with the RCMP. The community has some very good plans. We have agreed to collaborate with that first nation and help finance some of the work that needs to be done. This is to break up the criminal element from being able to operate in the way that it was. \lineBreak We are making progress and working collaboratively with that first nation."
922,"Mr. Speaker, as the minister has attested, the Samson Cree Nation initiated a joint review with the RCMP, the government and experts to address crime, which is among the highest in Canadian aboriginal communities. \lineBreak The key recommendation supported by all parties was to provide a youth centre to provide programs to divert youth from gangs. The first nation is begging the government to fully cost share with it. It is struggling to find other funders. \lineBreak Instead of spending billions more on jailing criminals after the fact, why will the government not offer more than one-fifth of the cost to build this centre and prevent more aboriginal victims of crime?","Mr. Speaker, we do believe in working in partnership with the first nations. \lineBreak The first nation, with its original proposal, talked about cost sharing. We are prepared to enter into cost-sharing agreements. We have done so. I think the actions we have agreed to take are appropriate for the circumstances."
923,"Mr. Speaker, the measure announced by the government to phase out subsidies to political parties is itself partisan. The Conservative Party is using a parliamentary rule to crush political parties who do not benefit from the visibility of being in power to raise funds. \lineBreak Will the government, before this House, commit to respecting usual parliamentary procedure for the debate on eliminating political subsidies?","Mr. Speaker, in 2006 our government took big business and big labour out of politics with the Federal Accountability Act. \lineBreak We are acting quickly to continue bringing transparency to government by phasing out the direct subsidy of political parties. We think money should come from voters, not from corporations, not from unions, and not from government. \lineBreak Political parties should do their own fundraising and not live off taxpayer-funded handouts."
924,"Mr. Speaker, it is now a full year since the rail freight service review was completed. It is over six months since the government promised to implement it. In March the government said it would work with all parties to draft legislation giving shippers the right to enforceable contracts with the railways. Now the government is suggesting a process to avoid legislation.  \lineBreak Which is it: enforce shippers' rights or avoid shippers' rights? I ask for the fourth time, will the legislation be introduced this year?","Mr. Speaker, in March of this year our government announced a comprehensive strategy that responds to the findings of the rail freight review. Our government is following up on its commitments to improve the performance of the rail-based supply chain. Stakeholders, all parties and certainly ours, everyone in the commercial sector and people who rely on rail freight will work together to make sure that we can have an efficient and effective rail freight operation in our country. We will be naming a facilitator for this process shortly."
925,"Mr. Speaker, it has been over a year. Clearly the government is dragging its feet on implementing the railway service review. Who gains by the slow response? The railways of course, while farmers pay higher rates for poorer service.  \lineBreak Are the government's efforts to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board really to protect its railway friends? We know it was the Wheat Board that challenged the railways on price gouging. It defended farmers' interests before the CTA and won 14 times against United States grain interests. Just for whom and why is the government making the reckless decision to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board?","Mr. Speaker, our government remains committed to giving western Canadian grain farmers the marketing freedom that they want and that they deserve. An open market in western Canada will attract investment. It will encourage innovation and will create value-added jobs. It is going to build a stronger Canadian economy.  \lineBreak The member knows that is true. He should join with us in bringing western Canadian farmers the freedom they deserve."
926,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General has confirmed that he cannot determine how the amounts allocated to the G8 slush fund were set. In the minutes of one of the meetings of the very select local area leadership group, the MP for  \lineBreak Because the local MP is not talking about local issues, can the foreign affairs minister tell us why the ","Mr. Speaker, that of course is not the case. The $50 million was allocated in budget 2009 as part of Canada's economic action plan. The goal was to spruce up an already beautiful part of our country so we could present our best face to the world. People at these summits stay over 100 kilometres away from the exact summit site. There was also, as is traditional for these types of initiatives, funding made available to thank the region for hosting the world. All 32 of the projects came in on or under budget."
927,"Mr. Speaker, according to the minutes that report what the minister said, amounts over and above the basic budget for the G8 Summit Management Office must be determined by the Prime Minister's Office. \lineBreak The Conservatives cannot deny what is in the documents uncovered by the NDP. That is why the mayor of Huntsville is embarrassed. \lineBreak Who approved the slush fund? Was it the ","No, Mr. Speaker."
928,"Mr. Speaker, in recent days the NDP has repeatedly talked about higher taxes on Canadians; everything from complaining about our GST reductions, demanding a new tax on everyday financial transactions, or punishing with a $10 billion-a-year hike on taxes for employers. This NDP high tax agenda is worrying for it would cost Canadian jobs when we can least afford it. \lineBreak Our Conservative government, on the other hand, is on a positive low tax and pro-job strategy for jobs and growth that actually is working.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report that Statistics Canada announced today that over 60,000 net new jobs were created in September. Our job growth shows that we are on the right track. \lineBreak Indeed, approximately 650,000 net new jobs have been created since July 2009. That is over 90% full-time jobs and nearly 80% of them from the private sector. \lineBreak However, too many Canadians are still looking for work and the global recovery remains very fragile. That is why we are looking forward to implementing the next phase of Canada's economic action plan and its job creating measures like the hiring credit for small businesses."
929,"Mr. Speaker, in Newfoundland and Labrador, rules surrounding access to the recreational food fishery continue to be unfair compared to other areas of Atlantic Canada. During the small window of opportunity this year the weather was deplorable, and during last week residents were not able to participate. Earlier this week I asked the  \lineBreak I ask the minister responsible for Newfoundland and Labrador: will he be fair and extend the recreational food fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador for this Thanksgiving long weekend?","Mr. Speaker, I know the minister has taken account of this request, but I would remind the member that the most important thing is the conservation and sustainability of the fishery. I think my colleague will know that the fishery has been under significant stress over the last number of years, and we need to do make the best decisions for the future of the fishery for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians."
930,"Mr. Speaker, government cuts to Service Canada are harming the most vulnerable Canadians. There are places in the country where it is no longer possible to speak to a human being. The telephone system hangs up on people who call before they are even able to speak to an agent. By cutting jobs at Service Canada, the government is choking the system. \lineBreak Why is the government cutting services for unemployed Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, we are committed to serving Canadian taxpayers responsibly and respecting the money they earn. That is why we are trying to improve the services offered by Service Canada. We are protecting our official languages and are making improvements to the telephone system. We are trying to provide the best service possible to Canadians."
931,"Mr. Speaker, the government clearly does not understand anything about what the unemployed in this country are going through. Some must even wait up to three months to receive their employment insurance benefits. Waiting periods are already too long, and the government is now adding to them by making cuts to the services offered by Service Canada. \lineBreak Will the government finally explain why it is preventing unemployed Canadians from accessing the insurance they themselves paid into?","Mr. Speaker, the reality is that during the global recession, we added workers to handle the increased volume of employment insurance claims, and we even improved standards. As a result, over 80% of people received their first employment insurance payment within four weeks, compared to 10 weeks under the Liberals."
932,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to come back to the issue of the Champlain Bridge. We will talk about the safety of the current bridge another time, but I want to come back to the issue of the new bridge. There is talk of a public-private partnership, a PPP. Unlike the NDP, we are in agreement with that and we will not change our minds. \lineBreak The issue of timelines is crucial. Environmental assessments take at least three years. A Mohawk cemetery has been discovered. Very serious negotiations will be needed. There is talk of expropriation and a development plan, and we have yet to touch on public transit. \lineBreak The people of Montreal and the south shore want timelines. Will the government table timelines?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is right—building a bridge like this will take time. Luckily, our government has had confirmation that the Champlain Bridge is safe, and we are working to keep it that way. We are taking the necessary measures to maintain that safety. If the safety of the Champlain Bridge was so important to the opposition parties, they should have supported our budget last March since it included this investment."
933,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, the Conservatives denied the request of the opposition members to hear His Excellency the Ambassador of Tunisia, who was in the room. The hon. member for  \lineBreak Since when does the government get to decide who the committees can hear from? Since when are public servants the only ones allowed to testify?","Mr. Speaker, the members of the committee are free to do their work. That is up to them. I will leave those decisions to the members of that committee. While I am here, I would like to congratulate the hon. member on her new position as the foreign affairs critic for the official opposition. I am happy to work with her."
934,"Mr. Speaker, the opposition members were willing to give up their allocated speaking time to hear the ambassador. By refusing to allow him to speak, the Conservatives are sending the wrong message to the Tunisians who want to participate in the democratic transition. Time is of the essence. They have an opportunity to elect a constituent assembly that will lead the country during the creation of a real democracy. Out of 28 countries that were asked to allow expatriates to vote, only Canada refused. \lineBreak Will the minister commit today to giving Tunisians living in Canada the tools to participate in the democratic transition?","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that Canadians who are also citizens of Tunisia are free to vote in Canada during the Tunisian elections, if they are eligible. The important thing is that Canada could not be part of a foreign constituency. However, there are more than a dozen countries that have participated in elections here in Canada, and Tunisia was free to do the same."
935,"Mr. Speaker, since 2006 our government has committed itself to maintaining good relationships with the provinces and territories from coast to coast to coast. Our government has also made it clear that we are the only party that stands up for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. \lineBreak Could the  \lineBreak [","Mr. Speaker, this is the first time that the Innu language has been heard in this House. \lineBreak While other parties play politics with the province, our government delivers results for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. Whether we talk about Lower Churchill, fighting for the sealing industry, or of course scrapping the long gun registry, we are the ones delivering for the province."
936,"Mr. Speaker, I have a second question for the government. Japan recently decided to purchase fighter jets and has launched a call for tenders, as we should have done. \lineBreak With a call for tenders, the best benefits are guaranteed and one can save a lot of money. Lockheed Martin has offered to assemble the F-35 jets in Japan, something it certainly did not offer to Canada. With a call for tenders, we would be guaranteed the best industrial benefits and we would save a lot of money. When will we have a call for tenders here in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, all reasonable Canadians agree that we need fighter jets to protect our sovereignty. We will continue to ensure that our Canadian armed forces have the best equipment. \lineBreak But we have a question. This F-35 program started under the Liberal government. Why are they now opposed to it? Why are they opposed to industrial benefits for cities like Montreal, for example?"
937,"Mr. Speaker, an internal audit of CanNor has found that the agency has violated almost every financial management rule since its creation, including all the directives regarding expense control. Internal audits are not the friends of this government. It should be pointed out that the agency has had five chief financial officers since its creation. \lineBreak Why is there total chaos at this agency, which is supposed to spearhead the government's strategy for the far north? Does this indicate how little importance the ","Mr. Speaker, I also encourage the member opposite to visit the north, Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, to see what is really happening on the ground, where we are investing in many development opportunities and opening mines during a global recession. \lineBreak This is a draft audit and, as I stated yesterday, we take all audits very seriously. I look forward to receiving the final audit and we will address the issues based on the audit."
938,"Mr. Speaker, harmonizing the language rights of workers in Quebec only makes sense and is a crucial step in recognizing the Quebec nation. Indeed, why should the employees of a chartered bank not enjoy the same rights as the employees of a credit union in Quebec? Other parties have tried to divide Quebeckers on this issue, but we in the NDP are building bridges between all communities. That is why I introduced a bill this week to amend the Canada Labour Code.  \lineBreak Will the Conservatives work with the NDP to harmonize the rights of Quebec employees working in businesses under federal jurisdiction with those of employees working for businesses under provincial jurisdiction?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. I would like to congratulate him on his work. \lineBreak The government is determined to continue to protect and promote our country's two official languages. "
939,"Mr. Speaker, I think it is safe to say that the government has undertaken one of the most ambitious expansions of its trade agenda in the last two decades. It is doing so because it understands that increased trade means increased demand for Canadian goods and services and increased economic growth. It also understands that over half of the Canadian economy and one in five Canadian workers depend on these trade agreements. \lineBreak Because this file is so important, would the government update the House on its trade agenda?","Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  \lineBreak Today, the minister will embark upon a trade mission to China, because we know that when Canadian businesses grow in this priority market, they create jobs and prosperity here at home. \lineBreak Despite the NDP's opposition, we will continue to pursue our job creating, pro-trade, low-tax plan, a plan that created over 650,000 jobs since July 2009."
940,"Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of us here, I would like to wish you, all my colleagues in the House of Commons and all Canadians a very happy Thanksgiving. \lineBreak Here is one thing the Conservatives will never talk about with respect to the plan they have over there. Since they took power, 305,000 additional Canadians now use the food bank, which means that a total of 910,000 Canadians this Thanksgiving  will need to rely on the charity of a food bank to have sustenance over this weekend, including many veterans. \lineBreak  Instead of dingwalling Parliament and using jets and slush funds to help themselves, when will the Conservatives introduce real policies to help the real poor in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP member's concern for the poor would be a lot more credible if he would actually do something to help them. \lineBreak Our government, in spite of the NDP, has introduced many measures to help the poor. To help them get over the welfare wall there is the working income tax benefit. We have lowered taxes, taking one million Canadians off the tax roll, leaving more money in their pockets to spend. We have increased the guaranteed income supplement for seniors, not once, but twice.  \lineBreak If it were up to the NDP, 14,000 affordable housing projects would not be under way to help Canadians."
941,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak I accept that the minister would never knowingly mislead this House but his answers do not accord with the facts. \lineBreak I have an email here to a responsible journalist with Postmedia in which it states that “an interview cannot be granted” with the scientist in question. \lineBreak  I would urge the parliamentary secretary not to tell us that the minister speaks for all scientists. The reality is that, if the minister is not muzzling these scientists, and I accept that he is not, will he investigate who in the Government of Canada is muzzling these scientists?","Mr. Speaker, I know the minister has addressed this issue on numerous occasions. \lineBreak However, before I answer the question, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague at Finance on Canada's new job numbers. The global recovery remains fragile but this government is working hard right now to get Parliament to implement the next phase of our action plan. \lineBreak I encourage my colleague across the aisle to vote in support of our budget measures, which include funding for climate change adaptation. And, ministers do speak for the government."
942,"Mr. Speaker, during question period, I referred to the  \lineBreak While I have the floor, I wonder if the ","Order, please. I appreciate the first part of the hon. member's point of order but, of course, the second part was not a point of order but a continuation of debate."
943,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Three out of four western academics say that his ill-conceived plan would hurt Alberta and British Columbia. The Prime Minister's former chief of staff, Tom Flanagan, said, “This bill scares me”. \lineBreak Why do the ","Mr. Speaker, the Liberals' agenda is clear. They would rather support the status quo in the Senate than reasonable and achievable reforms.  \lineBreak Alberta has shown that giving Canadians a say in Senate nominees is not only possible, but it works. We congratulate Premier Alward and his government on committing to give New Brunswickers real input into their Senate representatives."
944,"Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday the  \lineBreak If Environment Canada's ozone scientists are not being muzzled, why have these newspapers been denied access? Does the minister not consider these news organizations to be responsible media?","Mr. Speaker, we certainly are proud of the work of our scientists and the contributions they make to protecting Canada's environment. Ministers speak for the government. That is why we give answers in question period."
945,"Mr. Speaker, I was shocked by the glowing remarks from the parliamentary secretary about the appearance of the ",That is not a point of order but a continuation of debate. The member might like to take it up in a future question period or perhaps in committee where it seems to have occurred in the first place.
946,"Mr. Speaker, while the  \lineBreak The Conservatives claim that they believe in the free market, but they are happy to take away the rights of workers to market their value freely. \lineBreak Could the government explain why it is choosing sides and interfering in the bargaining process?","First of all, Mr. Speaker, I will address the fact that the preface of the hon. leader of the opposition's words was incorrect and that the accusation is false. She should know better and so should the NDP. I expect an apology on the matter. \lineBreak With respect to the Air Canada dispute, the government has reviewed all of the options that were available to it. Because the two parties have failed at the table and because the economy is still fragile, we have referred the matter to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for its considered opinion."
947,"Mr. Speaker, the government has a track record as a bad negotiator on softwood lumber, on buy America, and I am afraid it is at it again. With respect to the Canada-EU trade negotiation, European officials are saying that Canada would come out a loser. Canadian trade experts are saying that there is not enough in the deal to make it worthwhile. \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives continue to negotiate bad trade deals that put Canadian jobs at risk?","Mr. Speaker, our trade negotiation with the European Union is Canada's most important trade initiative since the signing of the historic North American free trade agreement. A trade agreement with the EU will increase Canada's economy by $12 billion and increase two-way trade by 20%. This is an ambitious free trade agreement. It will create jobs and economic growth for Canadians in all regions of the country."
948,"Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, that is a wish list. We have to see the government start to stand up for ordinary Canadians. By caving to European pharmaceutical companies, the Conservatives are driving up health care costs by up to $2.8 billion. Many seniors in Dartmouth--Cole Harbour, and across the country, are already having trouble making ends meet. This trade deal would mean that seniors will have an even harder time paying for the drugs that they need. \lineBreak My question is, why is this out-of-touch government negotiating deals that put the health care of Canadians at risk?","Mr. Speaker, I said earlier that the benefits to Canadians are clear. A trade agreement with the European Union is expected to boost Canada's economy by $12 billion and increase two-way trade by 20%. I would remind the member opposite that this government always protects and advances Canada's interests during international negotiations and will only enter into an agreement that is in the best interests of Canadians. "
949,"Unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. This government is still helping its buddies and is forgetting Canadians. It is completely irresponsible. \lineBreak The government is getting ready to sign a trade agreement with the European Union that could have serious consequences for Canadians. According to an expert study, if Canada waives patent protection for generic drugs, as the European Union wants, there could be nearly $3 billion in added costs for our health care system. \lineBreak Why is this government determined to negotiate an agreement that jeopardizes the health of Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has his facts wrong. Like all of Canada's trade agreements, a free trade agreement with the European Union would exclude public services such as public health, public education, and social services. Canada's trade obligations do not require us to privatize any part of our health care system. The claims to this are simply hogwash."
950,"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the facts. Canadians are worried that the Conservatives are giving their friends at the major pharmaceutical companies exclusive rights to data. Those are the facts. Manufacturers of generic drugs face long delays and added costs to get their products on the market. Is that not a double standard? \lineBreak How will families, who are already struggling to pay for medications, be able to afford them under such conditions?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind the member opposite that the government always protects and advances Canada's interests during international negotiations. We will only enter into an agreement that is in Canada's best interests. The benefits to Canada are clear. As I said earlier, a trade agreement with the European Union is expected to boost Canada's economy by $12 billion and increase two-way trade by 20%. Our ambitious pro-trade plan will create jobs and economic growth for Canadians in all regions of the country."
951,"Mr. Speaker, the federal government's own report shows that it will breach the legal limit for student loans by 2013. On average, Canadians are graduating with a debt of over $25,000, and tuition fees are still rising at four times the rate of inflation.  \lineBreak If the government is as serious as it says it is about securing Canada's economic future, why will it not commit to a plan to reduce tuition fees and take real action to reduce the debt that is burdening students and their families?","Mr. Speaker, we are concerned about ensuring students have access to post-secondary education, whether it is colleges or universities. That is why we introduced the apprentice incentive grant and the completion grant. That is why we introduced the Canada student grants program, which is helping 190,000 more students than the previous Liberal plan. That is also why we have made scholarships and bursaries tax free, and made improvements in the registered education savings plan.  \lineBreak Sadly, the NDP has voted against every single one of those efforts to help students."
952,"Mr. Speaker, obviously, the minister needs to do her homework. The reality is that tuition fees have never been higher, and by 2013, student debt will be more than $15 billion. The government is pushing an entire generation to the brink of bankruptcy. \lineBreak Will the government finally take measures to reduce the burden of student debt by developing an education transfer for the provinces?","Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are doing right now to help them. We have given universities and colleges billions of dollars for infrastructure so that students have a place to study and acquire the skills they will need in the labour market. \lineBreak We have made many efforts to help students through bursaries and tax measures. Unfortunately, the NDP has voted against every single one of these initiatives."
953,"Mr. Speaker, by threatening Air Canada's flight attendants with back-to-work legislation, the government interfered in the legitimate bargaining process between employees and employer. It made the situation even worse by using an unfair practice. Instead of promoting negotiations in good faith, the  \lineBreak Is making threats this Conservative government's new negotiation technique?","Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated, we are very disappointed that the two parties have not been able to attain their own collective agreement. Indeed, two times the parties at the table reached a tentative agreement and twice their membership rejected it in ratification.  \lineBreak I approached the member opposite on the concerns I had leading up to the second ratification vote and I asked that he work with me on this, and work with the union, because it is a serious matter which can be solved if the two parties come together and come to their own collective agreement."
954,"Mr. Speaker, last week a reprehensible crime took place here in Ottawa, but we will not have to bring in CSI Ottawa to find the guilty party. Organized labour in this country was bludgeoned by the Conservative government and the  \lineBreak However, the real crime here is that, for the past six days, rather than bringing the groups together, she has driven them apart. What really needs an upgrade here is her mediation skills. What is she doing to try to bring these groups back together again?","Mr. Speaker, since June 3 of this year, our government has been trying to give every facilitation available to the two parties.  \lineBreak  I which the member for  \lineBreak That being said, we are doing everything we possibly can to get the two parties together. They have reached an impasse and, as such, we will protect the economy and act in the best interests of Canadians."
955,"Mr. Speaker, RCEN is a network of 640 environmental organizations in Canada. For the past 30 years, the network has been facilitating and supporting the work of Environment Canada. Last May, Environment Canada confirmed that funding for the network's operations would be maintained. Confirmation of the funds was to follow. After months of waiting, the network learned on Friday that its funding would be cut. \lineBreak Why did the minister withdraw RCEN's funding?","Mr. Speaker, the government has decided not to enter into a contribution agreement with the Canadian Environmental Network this year. Responsible spending and sound management of tax dollars are important at all times. The department is moving toward a more direct use of web-based consultation, and we already have a number of web pages dedicated to public participation."
956,"What the Conservatives are doing, Mr. Speaker, is stifling dissent. They are muzzling or firing scientists and now they are eviscerating the communications network of environmental groups across Canada.  \lineBreak The minister claims that it is a rigorous process to manage spending, but while he was cutting half a million dollars from Canadian environmental groups, the government announced $28 million to celebrate the War of 1812.  \lineBreak Well, this just in, the real war is the war the government is waging on the environment. When will the minister do the right thing and restore this funding? ","Mr. Speaker, since 2006, our government has announced several important climate change and environmental protection initiatives. In the past year, we have announced several transportation regulations that are involved with our U.S. counterparts. I am happy to compare our record any day against the previous government, which did nothing but announce intentions."
957,"Mr. Speaker, this week is small business week, a great opportunity and time to highlight the fact that our small business owners are the economic motors and backbone of our economy. Small businesses create jobs and economic growth right across this country.  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best country in the world in which to do business. Do members know why? It is because we lowered taxes for all businesses. We will continue to do that because we know that when they have money in their pockets they can create jobs and wealth in this country. \lineBreak As the chair of the red tape reduction commission, I am pleased to say that we will work on ensuring that we have less red tape for Canadian entrepreneurs."
958,"Mr. Speaker, it is now 130 days since the Muskoka minister took a dive on accountability of the G8 slush fund. \lineBreak We now know that Huntsville was green-lighted to blow $30 million in federal money without tenders. We now know that the Muskoka minister got a job for his buddy. We now know that his campaign manager-turned-lobbyist hit up the federal government for millions in grants. \lineBreak The Auditor General said that the rules were broken and that it was Parliament's job to investigate. \lineBreak Will the government commit to a full parliamentary investigation to find out how $50 million was diverted into a personal slush fund for the rogue Muskoka minister?","Mr. Speaker, it will not come as any surprise to that member or to the House that I categorically reject the premise of the member's question. \lineBreak What we do know is that I approved 32 public infrastructure projects to support municipal, provincial and airport authority infrastructure in that region. \lineBreak As the Auditor General has reported, every dollar was accounted for in terms of the municipalities that incurred these infrastructure expenses. The Auditor General has come forward and made reports on how we can be even more accountable and more transparent to Parliament. We have completely accepted her good recommendations."
959,"Mr. Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board used a $50 million slush fund to award untendered contracts, give jobs to his friends and build an Olympic-sized arena, gazebos, a media centre that was never used and a campus that students do not go to. Last week, he described himself as the government's chief operating officer. First, that is very telling. Second, now we know why the President of the Treasury Board is not rising: his title has changed. \lineBreak Now, can the government's chief operating officer stand up and explain himself?","Mr. Speaker, all 32 of these projects had an individual contribution agreement with the municipalities or independent orders of government for which this government has always shown considerable respect. Each contribution agreement requires and sets out expectations and these expectations are expected to be followed."
960,"Mr. Speaker, we suspect that the government's chief operating officer likely followed the lead of the  \lineBreak While so many people are having trouble making ends meet, how can the minister explain excesses such as planned helicopter rides, the use of the Challenger and renovations that are costing taxpayers an arm and a leg? ","Mr. Speaker, it is unacceptable that any spending not be monitored, well coordinated and justified. In this particular case, the work that has been done was to relocate a number of new employees within the ministry. That coordination needed to be done to facilitate new members to the Department of National Defence, a new work area and new facilities."
961,"Mr. Speaker, let us look at the government's recent track record on defence procurement. \lineBreak Costs for Chinook helicopters have gone up by 70%, wasting billions. Untendered contracts for the F-35, costing Canadians untold billions, carry no guarantee of Canadian jobs. Instead of dealing with these issues, the defence department decided to blow $375,000 on office renovations. \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, we are concerned about all spending of tax dollars, the expenditure of this particular office renovation no less. We treat every dollar entrusted to us by taxpayers with the utmost care and respect. \lineBreak The Department of National Defence recently refitted the offices of the deputy minister and associate deputy minister and their staff to include them in a single office work area."
962,"Mr. Speaker, the government is railroading wheat and barley farmers who support maintaining their own single desk marketing and sales arm under the Canadian Wheat Board. \lineBreak The government is tying farmers to the track by removing their clout and ability to stand up to grain companies and unfair rail prices and transportation costs. It is removing their ability to be price setters and leaving them forced to accept the lowest price possible. \lineBreak Why will the so-called law and order government, intent on breaking the law, not follow the law set out in the Canadian Wheat Board Act and hold its own plebiscite before it introduces legislation to kill the single desk system?","Mr. Speaker, what an exciting day for western Canadian farmers to finally hear that legislation will be presented that will give them freedom. I will read what one of the farmers had to say about that. He said, “I have never been more optimistic than I am now to be a grain farmer in western Canada. These are exciting times. I am looking forward to the future and this legislation is well timed. We have been waiting a long time for it, so thank you”. \lineBreak That is from a western Canadian farmer."
963,"Mr. Speaker, the government wants to do away with the Canadian Wheat Board. Will its next victim be supply management? We all know that the government's chief negotiator for the free trade agreement with Europe said in committee that everything is on the table during the negotiations. \lineBreak How can we be assured that this government will not yield to pressure from the Europeans on the issue of supply management?","Mr. Speaker, when the minister appeared before the trade committee, he reassured the committee once again that supply management was protected by this government and would continue to be protected by this government."
964,"Mr. Speaker, the expert panel's report on research and development confirms that the government's innovation strategy is a failure. This government's lack of long-term vision is costing us jobs and reducing our ability to compete internationally. This government must do more to be a leader in innovation, because Canada is only marking time. \lineBreak When will this government finally help the businesses and researchers that innovate and move Canada forward?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for pointing out that we did receive a panel report today. I want to thank the panel for its hard work and assure the House that I will be considering all the recommendations in that report. \lineBreak We do want to celebrate with our businesses this week. We want our businesses to do research, develop new products and new markets. What that would mean for Canadians is jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs and a higher standard of living, and that is what we want."
965,"Mr. Speaker, it is nice to know that the minister knows there is a report, but it would help for him to read it because it would show him that the government's strategy has failed. As countries around the world move forward with new innovations, Canada keeps falling behind. \lineBreak  When will the government stop subsidizing corporate research and start promoting direct investment in R and D like leading countries do? When will it start listening to New Democrats and begin moving Canada forward by adequately funding basic scientific research so our scientists can get results for Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I assure the member that if he looks at the record of this government, he will see broad and extensive research funding for basic research all the way through to applied research. Indeed, this government has some of the most generous programs to encourage businesses to do their own research. We are expecting businesses to do a little more. We want to ensure they have the tools. \lineBreak  I will read the report and get back to the House very shortly."
966,"Mr. Speaker, in the past six years, our government has taken action that will result in an increase of Parks Canada's network of national parks and national marine conservation areas by 50%. This morning the  \lineBreak Could the parliamentary secretary update Canadians on what took place in Halifax today?","Mr. Speaker, this morning in Halifax, the  \lineBreak Today's memorable agreement will ensure that this iconic and valued Canadian landscape, fabled for its wild horses, shipwrecks and one of the largest dune systems in eastern Canada, will be protected as a national park reserve for the benefit of Canadians now and in the future. This is yet another example of how our government is taking concrete action to protect our country's natural heritage."
967,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak  First it puts the lives of fishers at risk by recklessly closing the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre in St. John's and now it wants to take the fishers out of the industry altogether by cutting the guts out of the department. \lineBreak When will the government live up to its responsibility and support the fishing industry instead of trying to destroy it?","Mr. Speaker, as I said previously, the FRCC has historically served an important role, but activities have been replaced by other approaches. Fisheries and Oceans Canada has built into its operations other ways to gather input from fish harvesters, including industry participation, stock assessments, development of an integrated fisheries management plan and through advisory committees."
968,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are at it again. The  \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is proud to represent western Canadian farmers. We remain committed to providing them with the same opportunities and the same freedoms that other farmers have across the country. We know full well that this is going to increase investment. We have already heard that. We heard an announcement last week in Regina that someone was going to spend $50 million on a pasta plant. It will be the first pasta plant in western Canada in decades. However, people need a free market in order to do that. We know that it will encourage innovation. We know that it is going to create value-added jobs and it is going to create a stronger economy in western Canada."
969,"Mr. Speaker, today kicks off the ninth round of negotiations toward an ambitious Canada-EU free trade agreement. We are trying to work with all parties in the House to create jobs and grow our economy. However, the NDP support for special interest groups that oppose free and open trade shows that the NDP does not represent ordinary Canadians who stand to benefit immensely from a free trade agreement with the European Union. \lineBreak I ask the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for  \lineBreak Today's events prove once again that the NDP and its special interest groups are ideologically opposed to free trade and will continue to invent any reason to oppose free and open trade. \lineBreak  We welcome the ninth round of negotiations as the benefits for Canadian workers and businesses through a free trade agreement with the EU are expected to be enormous: a 20% boost in bilateral trade, a $12 billion annual boost to Canada's economy and almost 80,000 new jobs created."

We know that is a provincial jurisdiction, but we will continue to work with the province to determine that there is no polluting of the marine environment and that it is not a hazard to navigation for the moment."
971,"Mr. Speaker, an internal memo to DFO employees has laid out the government's plans to wind down large ocean management projects, slash funding for science, services, aquaculture and other crucial departmental responsibilities. It seems that fishing communities are caught in the middle of the Conservative attack on facts and evidence.  \lineBreak Will the government stop its plan to destroy DFO and destroy Canada's fisheries and coastal communities?","Mr. Speaker, of course nothing could be further from the truth. Science is an important part of fisheries management, and we honour that principle and will continue in the future gaining information from science to better manage our fisheries."
972,"Mr. Speaker, today the  \lineBreak Can the government confirm that the selection committee set up in August has unanimously chosen a judge who does not understand French and that the government approves this choice?","Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. \lineBreak The Supreme Court of Canada is the pinnacle of our judicial system and we will continue to make appointments to that body on the basis of legal excellence and merit."
973,"Mr. Speaker, the minister is about to defend the gutting of $200 million from Veterans Affairs. I can see that he has his PMO script all ready to go. Why did Veterans Affairs spend $3 million on backdrops--","Order, please. The hon. member for Charlottetown."
974,"Why did Veterans Affairs spend almost $3 million on photo ops while gutting the department by $200 million? Why are there millions for PR stunts but nothing but cutbacks for the people who really matter, our veterans?","Mr. Speaker, contrary to the member, this government and this side of the House are investing in veterans. In the last six years we have invested $3 billion more than the current budget. This is $500 million more for our veterans and their families. We will stay the course because the veterans are a priority for this government."
975,"Mr. Speaker, instead of answering the concerns raised by the Occupy movement, the Conservatives are boasting that Canada's level of inequality is better than others, but the very conservative Conference Board has a different take: Canada has the highest increase of inequality of 16 peer nations, including the United States.  \lineBreak Surely the ","Mr. Speaker, as this government has said repeatedly, our focus is on jobs and growth. I would take this opportunity to note the job creation figures last month, which indicate that Canada has now created over 650,000 jobs since the recession. This is of course one of the best records in the developed world.  \lineBreak We have important measures that are before the House right now to continue making sure we have jobs and opportunities for all Canadians so they all participate in Canada's recovery."
976,"Mr. Speaker, in the past 10 years, more than 30% of economic gains went to 1% of the population, the wealthiest people. That is the result of the fiscal policies adopted by the Conservatives, and the Liberals before them. The middle class is becoming poorer, fewer people are working, the gap between rich and poor is widening, and profitable big business is receiving billions of dollars in tax cuts. \lineBreak Is the ","Mr. Speaker, we have reduced taxes for all Canadians. In any event, the NDP, because of its ideology, voted against tax cuts, including those for the poor. \lineBreak The Canadian economy has created more than 650,000 jobs since the recession. That is the best performance in the developed world, and that is how we are ensuring that Canadians participate in the economy and the economic recovery."
977,"Mr. Speaker, the government is mocking Canadians when it says that 650,000 new jobs have been created since the recession. That is false and the  \lineBreak Where is the job creation plan?","Mr. Speaker, the figures I gave are correct. Everyone knows that. We have brought before the House other measures to create more jobs. However, just last night, the NDP again voted against these job creation measures. \lineBreak The NDP seems to misunderstand its role when it stands up and votes against job creation measures. It is not supposed to just occupy the House. It is supposed to do something for the Canadian people."
978,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Wheat Board is the largest and most successful grain marketing company in the world. It is a Canadian success story with a proven track record of providing the best possible returns for farmers and minimizing their risk.  \lineBreak We can prove our arguments with detailed, empirical evidence, but there is no business case for dismantling the Canadian Wheat Board. There has never been one shred of evidence that farmers will be better off without the Wheat Board. \lineBreak In these uncertain economic times, how can the government be so reckless and irresponsible as to turn the prairie farm economy on its head without even doing a cost benefit analysis? ","Mr. Speaker, the first thing the member for "
979,"Mr. Speaker, the Americans certainly understand what an advantage the Wheat Board is to farmers because 13 times they went to the WTO and complained that it was an unfair trade practice because it was such an advantage, and 13 times the WTO ruled that there was nothing unfair about Canadian farmers acting collectively to stand up in their own best interests. \lineBreak If the Wheat Board is not such an advantage to prairie farmers, why is the American agri-food business so eager kill it and, the big question is, why is the government willing to do its dirty work for it?","It is very interesting, Mr. Speaker, that the first person out of the gate announcing value added in western Canada is a western Canadian. Murad Al-Katib, with Alliance Grain Traders, has announced a $50 million investment for durum production in the lower part of Saskatchewan where the durum is grown. He will create 60 value-added jobs. I do not know why the member opposite is against farmers and against jobs in western Canada."

I would encourage the NDP and the Liberal Party to stop opposing those measures."
981,"Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear and that is that, despite the  \lineBreak I will repeat the same question: why not give tax credits to the poorest people in the country? That is how to make the system more progressive. That is what the government needs to do.","Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Liberal Party is talking about tax credits that his party voted against. These are important measures for Canadian families. Other measures that are important to job creation, the business community and SMEs are now before this House. I encourage the Liberal Party to reverse its position and support these tax credits, which are very important for the Canadian economy. "
982,"Mr. Speaker, a group of experts has said that $3 billion is handed out every year in tax credits for research and development and that this does not have any significant impact on economic growth and business development. Yet the government continues to provide ineffective tax credits. \lineBreak Will this government recognize that it would be better off creating a plan to help businesses innovate and create jobs?","Mr. Speaker, our government is focused on encouraging businesses to do more research and development because not only will that help the business itself but it will create more jobs for Canadians, and that is what we want. \lineBreak We did launch a panel to review our programs to see how we could make them better to get more results for Canadians. This is very important to Canadians so we will look at the report and consider all the recommendations quite seriously."
983,"Mr. Speaker, according to  \lineBreak When will this government come up with a plan to create innovative jobs instead of lining the pockets of consultants?","Mr. Speaker, that is exactly why we launched the panel. \lineBreak If we can get businesses to do more research and development, develop new products or a new process on which they make a product now, or perhaps find a new market for existing products, that will create high-paying, high-value jobs for Canadians. That will improve the quality of living for Canadians. That is what the government wants. That is why we are looking at the panel. \lineBreak Last night, the NDP voted against improving the quality of life for Canadians."
984,"Mr. Speaker, the Jenkins report released yesterday confirmed that this government's innovation strategy in its research and development support policy is a failure. This government is the worst performer among major industrialized countries as far as direct public investment in research and development is concerned. This government is a laggard in terms of the number of patents issued. It is ranked last in terms of the number of doctoral graduates and is among the worst performers when it comes to businesses' financial contribution to research and development. \lineBreak What is the government going to do to finally address this pitiful situation?","Mr. Speaker, as I just mentioned, we did launch an R and D panel to review all of the government's programs that encourage small and large businesses to do more research and development. The panel reported yesterday. It is a great report. We are looking at it. It is a very serious issue for Canadians. We will give it serious consideration.  \lineBreak We will improve the quality of life of Canadians because that is what we on this side of the House want."
985,"Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we believe in research and development and sound industrial policy. On that side of the House, the facts speak for themselves.  \lineBreak The government has failed on patent development. It has failed on supporting PhDs. It t is pouring billions into blind corporate tax cuts and costly tax credits that have failed to stimulate research and development. Canada is last in direct R and D public investment among all industrialized countries. \lineBreak Will the government commit now to increasing direct R and D public investment? We have said it. The reports are saying it. When will the government do the right thing?","Mr. Speaker, obviously, the government wants to encourage businesses to do more research and development. That is where the high paying, high quality jobs of the future will come from.  \lineBreak I thank the member for finally getting interested in science and technology, research and development, because in his party's election platform it was mentioned nowhere."
986,"Mr. Speaker, we are increasingly concerned that the government is selling out Canadians in order to push through a flawed deal with Europe. However, members should not take our word for it. I will quote Anna Robasch, a Danish member of the European parliament, who said, “At the moment Europe will be able to export more than what Canada will be exporting”. \lineBreak When will the government admit that it is losing out in these negotiations and start putting the interests of Canadians first?","Mr. Speaker, that question only proves once again that the NDP is ideologically opposed to free trade. \lineBreak On our side of the House, we welcome the ninth round of negotiations as the benefits to Canadian workers and businesses through a free trade agreement with the EU are expected to be enormous: a 20% boost in bilateral trade; a $12 billion annual boost to Canada's economy; 80,000 new jobs for Canadian workers; and $1,000 average extra income for Canadian families."
987,"Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the minister and the government cannot see because of their rose-coloured glasses.  \lineBreak We need some straight talk on the impacts of this deal. European officials are quite happy to tell us what is going on. One European official boasted that Europe stands to gain while Canada loses. He said, “there will be some losers, there are always losers”. \lineBreak Why is the government content with this loser status? Why will the government not start giving the straight goods to Canadians and stand up for them?","Mr. Speaker, there was some chattering across the way and I did not hear the end of the question but I will give what I expect the member is looking for as an answer. \lineBreak Some hon. members may not have realized it but we received a strong mandate from Canadians, which is why we have a majority government and why we are pursuing free trade agreements that will benefit Canadians, benefit Canadian workers and supply Canadian jobs to Canadians who need those jobs."
988,"Mr. Speaker, it is only fair that the House add seats for British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, provinces that are under-represented here. \lineBreak However, on its first attempt at democratic reform, the government left out Ontario and insulted its premier. On its second attempt, it left out Quebec, making it the only province with a relative decline in population to be under-represented. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, our government made three distinct promises concerning representation in the House of Commons. First, we would increase the number of seats now and in the future to better reflect population growth in British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta. Second, we would protect the number of seats for smaller provinces. Finally, we would protect the proportional representation of Quebec according to population. \lineBreak Those are our three commitments and we intend to bring forward legislation shortly respecting those commitments. "
989,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, we will certainly react, as we have done in the past. I would like to quote the report of the Commissioner of Official Languages, which I have here. It says that our government “made it possible to initiate or continue numerous projects aimed at promoting linguistic duality to all Canadians, fostering the economic development of the communities, and improving their situations, especially in the areas of health care, education, immigration and culture.” This report highlights the fact that our government is making unprecedented investments in protecting and celebrating Canada's two official languages."
990,"Mr. Speaker, vague answers like that do nothing to protect our country's two official languages. The proposals set out in the commissioner's report represent the bare minimum the government should be doing. If the  \lineBreak Is the ","Mr. Speaker, I will answer in the other official language to avoid any vagueness. \lineBreak Quoting directly from the report, which states: \lineBreak Not vague, it is direct. We are getting the job done."
991,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government's crime bill adds longer sentences for drug offences, increases mandatory minimums and cuts conditional sentences.","Order, please. I would ask hon. members to applaud when he is finished asking the question, not during the preamble, so the House can actually hear the substance of the question. \lineBreak  The hon. member for Charlottetown."
992,"Mr. Speaker, however, even the toughest anti-crime advocates in America say that this strategy is just plain wrong. Even the staunchest conservative Republicans in Texas are repealing mandatory minimums and increasing drug treatment programs because they slash crimes at a tenth of the cost. \lineBreak Why is the government ignoring the evidence and wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a crime strategy that just will not work?","Mr. Speaker, unfortunately there was a misleading report on CBC last night. In fact, the bill that we have before Parliament specifically excludes drug treatment courts that are already in existence in Canada. \lineBreak If Texas and other places are emulating or copying the Canadian experience, that is a beautiful thing, and anything we can do to help them, we would be glad to do."
993,"Mr. Speaker, under the Texas government's new approach of less jail time and more treatment, the rate of prisoners reoffending has dropped by 75%. In contrast, Conservative crime laws are already putting thousands more people into overcrowded jails and 85% cannot get the treatment programs they need, plus funding for treatment has been slashed while security costs soar. \lineBreak Why is the government fast-tracking a bad bill that even Texans know will deliver more crime, more victims, less justice and spiralling costs?","Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the member is relying on a misleading CBC report. \lineBreak The incarceration rate in Texas is proportionately five times higher than in Canada. In fact, the safe streets and communities act includes specific exemptions for drug treatment courts that are already operating across Canada. As the  \lineBreak  Those members should vote in respect of the bill that we have before the House."
994,"Mr. Speaker, infectious salmon anemia has been diagnosed in sockeye smolts in the Pacific. This is the same virus that infected and wiped out almost 70% of farmed salmon in Chile. \lineBreak  We do not know the long-term effects on wild salmon or how long this virus has been present in the Pacific waters. What is the government doing to investigate this serious threat to our salmon fishery?","Mr. Speaker, our government understands the importance of salmon for British Columbia economically, historically and culturally. That is why the "
995,"Mr. Speaker, the government's silence on fisheries is deafening. Instead of providing answers, there is no communication from the department, and scientists remain muzzled. Conservatives are gutting the DFO and cutting funding to fisheries conservation councils. Their policy seems to be “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” and they hope these problems will go away. They will not. \lineBreak When will the minister agree to a full and transparent investigation of this serious issue and threat to our fisheries?","Mr. Speaker, a strategic review was an opportunity for the department to assess performance of its programs. It also allowed us to ensure that we were responding to the priorities of Canadians. We have the responsibility to spend taxpayer money prudently and where it will do the most good. We must ensure that government programs are efficient and  effective and achieve the expected results of Canadians. \lineBreak  DFO is making steady progress in modernizing and improving our program and policy approach to meet the needs of Canadians today and in the future."
996,"Mr. Speaker, I was dismayed to learn last week some of the details surrounding the apparent plot by Iran to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Washington. While the plot was thankfully foiled this time, the threat that Iran poses to the world remains. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada finds Iran's actions absolutely and totally unacceptable. We condemn them without reservation. \lineBreak  Last week I committed to working with our international partners in considering the consequences for such actions.

Their family in Canada is gravely concerned and has said, “It took three weeks for a Canadian official to simply visit the family from the time they were taken away. We have had no contact with my brother for a month now and his daughter is suffering illness and needs medical attention. Please help”. \lineBreak When will the minister get off her seat and offer some help? If not, will she step aside and let the ","Mr. Speaker, in spite of his bombast, I can assure the member that Canadian consular officials are in fact providing the detained Canadian, his family and their relatives with consular assistance as requested both here and in Saudi Arabia. \lineBreak  We have been granted access to see the family. We will continue to engage with Saudi officials about this family's case and provide it with the support it has requested."
998,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak The problem is that Quebec is being asked, unfairly and disproportionately, to cut more. Out of 150,000 hours of cuts planned, 53% are scheduled for Quebec, when it is 4% to 8% for the other provinces, on average. That means serious hardship in the regions, and doing this means that Canada Post is disregarding the suggestions made by the Fédération québécoise des municipalités.  \lineBreak  Canada Post management is doing this. Why?","Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is responsible for delivering mail to Canadians. We have done everything to ensure that the service charter that this government introduced is fulfilled, and Canadians will get their mail and Canadian businesses will be able to do their business.  \lineBreak I would like to point out that the opposition parties are the very parties that tried to prevent the government from ensuring that Canadians get their mail in a timely manner. The opposition parties should look at their own records. "
999,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime. This is one reason  our government received a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe.  \lineBreak Bill  \lineBreak Contrary to a recent report by CBC, Bill  \lineBreak Could the minister inform the House on how Bill ","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite correct. Canadians are quite concerned about crime. Contrary to the report, as I pointed out, there are specific exemptions in the bill with respect to drug treatment courts. \lineBreak We have also been very clear that if individuals get into the business of selling drugs to children or  bring illegal drugs into this country, they will go to jail, and that is what Canadians want."
1000,"Mr. Speaker, earlier today I shared with the  \lineBreak I am so proud to represent the people of  \lineBreak Will the minister reassure us that the redistribution will be by population and not by population of Conservative voters?","Mr. Speaker, the statute is quite clear. It sets out a process for redistribution that is run on a non-partisan basis by independent commissions. Those will be under way in the appropriate time.  \lineBreak Under our legislation, we will ensure that there is a formula in place that ensures people of Saanich—Gulf Islands--or of British Columbia, in fact, and all of Canada--will have the fair representation that has long been denied to them."
1001,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak We have a thickening of the border, a continuing attack on the marine tax and other continuing attacks on the Canadian economy, and the  \lineBreak The ","Mr. Speaker, the logic of the Liberal Party, judging from that question, is that, because the Americans want to buy certain products in the United States, we should not allow Canadian farmers to sell their own products. \lineBreak The Liberal Party should ask itself why it does not have a single representative whose riding is predominantly in rural western Canada. It is because it does not listen to western farmers. This is something western farmers have been needing and demanding for decades, and that day is finally here."
1002,"Mr. Speaker, I want to speak a little further on the points that were raised earlier today related to section 47.1 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act and the question of privilege on the potential contempt allegation that was raised by the member opposite. It was the hon. member for  \lineBreak Our government, of course, considers the bill, which would restore freedom to Canadian farmers, to be of great importance. We returned to office after the last election and after a broad consultation with Canadians, I hasten to add, with a clear set of issues that we promised Canadians we would tackle. Establishing marketing freedom for Canadian farmers was one of those critically important issues.  \lineBreak At the core of my friend's submissions, the hon. gentleman asserts that there would be a breach of section 47.1 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act if that act is amended or repealed by Bill  \lineBreak As noted earlier by the  \lineBreak I would refer the House to page 261 of the second edition of  \lineBreak Mr. Speaker Lamoureux, on July 8, 1969, at page 1319 of  \lineBreak On May 2, 1989, a ruling by Mr. Speaker Fraser articulated at page 1175 of  \lineBreak Another ruling by Mr. Speaker Fraser on April 9, 1991, at page 19233 of  \lineBreak In these circumstances, I would argue that the Canadian Wheat Board Act is no different. Your predecessor, Mr. Speaker, has also made similar rulings, including those found at page 6123 of  \lineBreak I would go further than that. If one is to accept the logic that has been set out by the members opposite, what they are suggesting is that one can, by passing a statute in the House, effectively fetter the future discretion of the House in passing future laws. In effect, by simply stating it is a law, they are saying that some laws stand above others and they essentially become constitutional provisions that cannot be amended by the House. Clearly, that would not be appropriate.  \lineBreak The precedent set by that approach would potentially create a very difficult situation to manage in the future, in the sense that any government could ensure that none of its measures could ever be repealed by a subsequent government through our democratic process simply by providing measures such as those that are referred to in section 47.1, barriers that stand in the way of modification of a statute. The fact is that Parliament reigns supreme on the question of passing statutes, and that includes amending statutes that are already in existence. The only law that stands above that is, of course, constitutional law. \lineBreak Mr. Speaker, I would suggest for that reason also--that is, the practical, logical problems that would result were Parliament able to fetter the subsequent discretion of all future Parliaments in this fashion--that our democratic system would indeed be paralyzed and held back by the heavy hand of history.  \lineBreak Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to find that the claim raised by the hon. member is beyond the jurisdiction of the Chair and that therefore no prima facia question of privilege can be found here.",Is the hon. member for Malpeque rising on the same point?
1003,"Yes I am, Mr. Speaker, just to add a little further.  \lineBreak Parliament clearly set out in its law, passed in 1997, the right of self-determination for farmers who ship through the Canadian Wheat Board. Parliament, this place that we call a democracy, passed a law, and here we have a government not going as far as allowing, as stipulated in the law, a vote of producers. What are we to see next? Will it be that there will not be elections every four years and that it will be ten years instead, because the Prime Minister so decides, and with his massive majority passes it in the House? \lineBreak We have a responsibility as parliamentarians. My point of privilege is this: I am being asked as a member of Parliament to act on a piece of legislation to disband legislation that was passed in the House to give the right to farmers of self-determination in terms of their destiny. We are asked to look at a bill that takes that right away from them. It violates their right to vote as stated under section 47.1 of the act. Parliament made a commitment, and this is indeed a very serious issue. I believe it goes to the essence of our democracy. We are taking away rights. \lineBreak No one is asking you, Mr. Speaker, to look at the legality of it. You are taking my right away as a member of Parliament if you rule with the government and you are certainly taking farmers' rights away if you rule with the government, because we passed a law in 1997. If you go back to the remarks I made this morning, I quoted from the minister of the day. He very clearly laid out the intent of that legislation, which was to give primary producers the right to have a say in their own destiny. \lineBreak This is an extremely serious issue, and I do not put much merit in what the House leader opposite has said. ",I will allow the government House leader a brief opportunity to respond.
1004,"Mr. Speaker, responding narrowly to the point that my friend has raised, what he is saying logically is that Parliament has in effect delegated its decision-making power to another party and can never resume that power.  \lineBreak That of course would be an inappropriate delegation. Parliament cannot delegate its legislative or statutory powers. Those are powers that are held only by this body. They are not powers that can be delegated to any other group of individuals in the country. Therefore, the kind of delegation that he purports has happened here simply cannot be held to be a reasonable approach. Were it to be the case, we would have a situation in which Parliament would effectively become unable to govern the country, as powers could be delegated to other bodies by a previous Parliament, and this Parliament could never be able to legislate.  \lineBreak The arguments I have made are only further reinforced, I believe, by the logical outcome of my friend's position.",I thank hon. members for their further submissions. Once again I assure them that I will take these submissions under advisement and come back to the House with a ruling in due course. 
1005,"I would like to draw to the attention of hon. members the presence in the gallery of the Honourable David Alward, Premier of New Brunswick.","I would like to draw to the attention of hon. members the presence in the gallery of the recipients of the Governor General’s Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case: Nancy Hartling, Lucie Joyal, Kim Pate, Madeline Boscoe, Sharon Donna McIvor, and Amber JoAnn Fletcher, the Youth Award recipient."
1006,"Mr. Speaker, young families are feeling the squeeze from all sides. They are struggling to raise their kids, pay their bills, take care of their parents. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes have stalled. The average family makes just over $68,000, the same as in 1976, and yet Canada's top CEOs now average whopping $6.6 million a year.  \lineBreak Why are Conservatives adding to this inequality? Why will they not help out struggling Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, we have made substantial tax reductions for Canadian families, a total, for a typical Canadian family, of about $3,000 a year. We have cut taxes in every way that the government collects them. We have increased the amount Canadians can earn tax free. We have fewer Canadians now paying any federal tax all. As well, there have been the creation of 650,000 net new jobs since the end of the recession."
1007,"Mr. Speaker, clearly, things are getting so much worse for young families. Families are tired of the same old failed Conservative policies, no plan to create jobs and no plan to make life more affordable. Families today have a lower standard of living than their parents. CEO salaries are now one hundred times that of an average Canadian. Banks get richer. Young families are squeezed by bills and debt. \lineBreak Why are the government and the minister ignoring the needs of young Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, why is the official opposition continually voting against every tax measure we bring into the House to help families in Canada and to help those who are on social assistance and who want to work? It was the party opposite that voted against the working income tax benefit, which is probably the most important social reform since the RRSP, but the NDP members voted against it."
1008,"Mr. Speaker, a new study from the University of British Columbia confirms that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Canadians to raise their families. Families are facing an increase in housing costs, a stagnation of income and a decrease in services. They are having more and more trouble making ends meet.  \lineBreak Why does this government not make life more affordable for these families rather than lowering the taxes of large corporations?","Mr. Speaker, I know that the NDP's solution to all of this is a new $10 billion tax, which it put forward to the Canadian people during the last election and which was resoundingly rejected.  \lineBreak What the Canadian people and Canadian families need is tax relief. They can pay less tax and they need jobs, so we are creating jobs as well. I hope the member opposite will vote for the hiring credit for new hires that is in the bill before the House, the second budget bill."
1009,"Mr. Speaker, today, Canadian families have a lower standard of living than baby boomers did at their age. The average annual income of Canadian families has remained stable since the mid-1970s, but the cost of housing has increased by 76%. Canadian families have record levels of household debt. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives take care of this generation, which is losing services and being pushed into excessive debt?","Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite knows or should know, Canada is relatively well off. We have the best debt to GDP number in the G7. We have the best employment job creation record in the G7. "
1010,"Mr. Speaker, a new report from the Canadian Council of Chief Executives and the Canada China Business Council says that the Conservatives have fumbled economic dealings with the region so badly that Canada now has a bad reputation with Asia. Once again, the Conservatives are blundering relations with yet another important trade partner. \lineBreak How can Canadians trust the Conservatives to move Canada forward on trade when every time they sign a deal they set the country back?","Mr. Speaker, our government understands that closer and deeper economic ties between Canada and Asia will benefit both our countries by creating more jobs, opportunities and prosperity.  \lineBreak The facts are this. I was in China last week demonstrating what Canada has to offer and to help expand our trade and investment relationship. Negotiations are moving forward on a FIPA with China. The week before I was in Indonesia and I signed Canada's first trade and investment framework agreement with Asia. We are getting it done for hard-working Canadians."
1011,"Mr. Speaker, the problem is that even the government's friends say that it has fumbled another deal. Again today, we heard that the Conservatives have continued to mess up the relations with the U.S. Another round of U.S. stimulus has meant that Canada is being excluded.  \lineBreak The Conservatives continue to ask Canadians to trust them while they negotiate a massive, closed door deal with Europe. \lineBreak Every time the Conservatives make a deal, Canada loses. When will the Conservatives stop folding on trade negotiations and start standing up for Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, while that member was here grandstanding, I was in Washington dealing with my counterpart and meeting with key decision-makers and business people in the United States. \lineBreak  In these challenging times, deeper trade ties are the best way to create jobs on both sides of the border. We will continue to demand the removal of buy American measures. They are hurtful to both economies on both sides of our border. Protectionist measures, as proposed in the American jobs bill, are a danger to our fragile global economic recovery."
1012,"Mr. Speaker, his weak response is a reflection of their weakness at the bargaining table. Canada is in the process of negotiating a trade agreement with the European Union that could disrupt our local dairy and cheese markets because of the massive influx of products from a market of 650 million people. Our supply management system, which has been working effectively for 40 years, is in jeopardy. \lineBreak Does this government commit to taking the supply management system off the bargaining table and protecting the families who depend on this industry?","Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear, time and time again, that we are defending supply management. We are standing up for the farmers and their families of this country. \lineBreak The truth is that the NDP is opposed to trade. That is the reality of it and the proof is in the pudding. The NDP members talk big about trade and about fair trade but what they really mean is no trade at all."
1013,"Mr. Speaker, the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group has called on member states to address human rights directly and make it a priority at their upcoming meetings in Perth.  \lineBreak In 41 of 54 Commonwealth states being gay is still illegal, meaning people who are otherwise law-abiding could be arrested and prosecuted just for being gay. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada will be taking a very active role in Perth to ensure the issue of human rights is front and centre. There are substantial proposals that will be before Commonwealth leaders, including issues with respect to human rights, a Commonwealth charter, more democracy and more freedom.

This is a fundamental human rights issue and an important step in the fight against the spread of HIV-AIDS. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, absolutely. At the last Commonwealth summit, the  \lineBreak At the Commonwealth summit in Perth, we will continue to fight for human rights to ensure that Canadian values are promoted and advanced at these international summits, and that certainly includes the rights of gays and lesbians."
1015,"Mr. Speaker, if the  \lineBreak Will the minister intervene and stop this forced removal until the appeal is heard? ","Mr. Speaker, we have a very fair asylum system, but it is a legal system, not a political system. It is up to the courts, to the quasi-judicial bodies such as the Immigration and Refugee Board, and to the Federal Court, to decide whether or not people are refugees who need Canada's protection. It is totally inappropriate for members of Parliament or even ministers to reverse the legal decisions of our just legal system."
1016,"Mr. Speaker, we know that when they return to Mexico, these two men and their family members will again be subjected to threats, violence and persecution.  \lineBreak Before coming to Canada, they were attacked many times by the authorities that should have been protecting them. Mr. Perez and Mr. Gonzalez have legitimate reasons to fear for their lives if they leave Canada. \lineBreak What steps is this government taking to ensure that violence against these men and other members of Mexico's homosexual community is taken seriously?","Mr. Speaker, this Parliament created the Immigration and Refugee Board to examine asylum claims on the basis of evidence and the criteria permitted by our laws. It is up to the board to decide if a person is being persecuted or if the personal safety of that person is threatened. It is up to the Federal Court to review those decisions. There is even a pre-removal risk assessment. If the appeal is denied, another appeal to the Federal Court is possible. That means that we have a fair and just system for all asylum seekers."
1017,"Mr. Speaker, this week is dedicated to small and medium-sized businesses that create wealth and jobs throughout Canada. They play a vital role in our economy.  \lineBreak Can the minister responsible for small business and tourism tell the House what measures have been taken to support these businesses?","Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to tell the House what this government is doing for small and medium-sized businesses. We have cut their tax rate to 11%. We have created the Red Tape Reduction Commission. We know that time is money for small businesses and they need to spend less time filling out government paperwork and more time doing what they do best—creating jobs in Canada. We support entrepreneurs and we are proud of them."
1018,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, after 131 days of dodging accountability, the Muskoka minister finally peered up over his desk. He made a quick little joke and he went back into hibernation. However, he did not say “sorry”. He did not explain why he ran a slush fund from his office. He did not explain why the paper trail was hidden from the Auditor General. The Auditor General said that the rules were broken and Parliament must investigate. \lineBreak  Will the minister do the right thing? Will he come out of hibernation, stand in this House, and commit to a full parliamentary investigation of his role in the G8 slush fund?","Mr. Speaker, it will not come as any surprise to my friend from northern Ontario that I do not agree with the premise of his question. \lineBreak The Auditor General has thoroughly looked into this issue.

Unless we fix the rules, this will happen again and again under his watch.","Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to correct the record for my friend opposite. None of the three individuals he mentioned approved any of the 32 projects. I did."

These are achievements. These are results. This is a Conservative government."
1023,"Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Small Business Week, the situation of small businesses in the country is alarming. According to Industry Canada's most recent newsletter, funding for small business has levelled off since the Conservatives came to power. Business owners have to work extremely hard, but this government prefers to give enormous tax cuts to corporations, even though we know such cuts are ineffective. \lineBreak Will this government listen to the NDP and lower the tax rate for small businesses?","Mr. Speaker, I like hearing the NDP advocating tax cuts. The hon. member's argument is a bit awkward because, at the same time, some of his colleagues are advocating more government spending, bigger government and a larger debt. Instead of stimulating the economy, they want to give it a sedative by spending money that we do not have. The important thing for small businesses is that we have cut their tax rate to 11% so they can keep more money in their pockets and do what they have to do best: create jobs."
1024,"Mr. Speaker, I do not want to see the government simply tossing quarters here and there for small businesses.  \lineBreak Let us look at something else. Under this government, it is becoming increasingly difficult for young entrepreneurs to get funding, yet small businesses are responsible for creating 60% to 70% of jobs. This situation is unsustainable, especially knowing that the youth unemployment rate is at a worrisome level. \lineBreak Will this government finally introduce a job creation tax credit, as the NDP has been asking for?","Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the hon. member that I was in Montreal yesterday with the Canadian Youth Business Foundation, which provides $15,000 loans to young entrepreneurs who want to start a business and create wealth. \lineBreak By giving that foundation a contribution of $20 million in the last budget, we have enabled 1,000 young entrepreneurs across the country to create their own jobs, as well as jobs for other Canadians. That is what it means to support young entrepreneurs."
1025,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the government introduced the historic marketing freedom for grain farmers act. This legislation will allow farmers in my riding to market their wheat and barley to any buyer of their choice, just like farmers in eastern Canada. This is legislation that farmers want and expect to see passed by Parliament and it will modernize research in the grain sector in western Canada.  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, as a farmer, my friend and colleague from  \lineBreak  We will continue to do that under that marketing freedom for grain farmers act, with a voluntary point of sale check off, which will keep the funding flowing for those great entities like the Canadian International Grains Institute, the Western Grains Research Foundation and the Malt Barley Technical Centre. "
1026,"Mr. Speaker, it has become obvious to all Nova Scotians that in the case of the MV  \lineBreak Premier Dexter says that he cannot get an answer from Ottawa, so I will give the minister an opportunity to respond today. \lineBreak  Will the minister state clearly here today whether he believes the responsibility to remove that ship lies solely with the Province of Nova Scotia? It is a very simple question. Is the Province of Nova Scotia solely responsible for the removal of that wreck?","Mr. Speaker, the premier has already had some discussions with the minister of this government. We gave him the answer we gave here in the House. Transport Canada's role is to ensure that Canada's waterways provide safe navigation, free of ship source pollution. We have determined that the MV "
1027,"Mr. Speaker, over the last five years, many workers across Canada have seen their pensions drastically reduced because their employers went out of business. Yesterday, I tabled Bill  \lineBreak  Will the government work with New Democrats to give pensioners the protection they need?","Mr. Speaker, I wish the New Democrats would have worked with us when we moved legislation to protect those pensions to which he referred. In fact, in 2009 they voted against protecting pensions by requiring companies to fully fund pension benefits on planned termination. We also ensured that pensions would be stable for those seniors and we gave pensioners more negotiating powers in their own pensions. The NDP voted against all of those pieces in that legislation. "
1028,"Mr. Speaker, the national shipbuilding strategy will result in the creation of thousands of new jobs and billions in economic growth in the cities and communities all across Canada. This is an arm's-length process, independent from the government. \lineBreak The leader of the official opposition is calling, at this late stage, for the government to politically intervene and provide the contract to all three shipyards that submitted bids. \lineBreak Could the minister please respond to this call?","Mr. Speaker, our government made the historic decision to build our ships for the navy and coast guard right in Canada and that will result in the creation of 15,000 jobs annually for the next 30 years. \lineBreak The decision to have two Canadian shipyards build our large ships was made in consultation with the shipyards themselves. The national shipbuilding strategy was designed to generate a competitive environment that would result in the best value for taxpayers. \lineBreak I am also happy to inform the House that I met with the fairness monitor yesterday. He has submitted his final reports and has said that the decisions were made objectively, free from personal favouritism and political influence and encompass the elements of openness, competitiveness, transparency and compliance."
1029,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the  \lineBreak Can the Prime Minister tell us what President Obama said when they spoke yesterday?","Mr. Speaker, we are in regular contact with our American counterparts. They are well aware of our position on the buy American policy. It seems to me that protectionism is a hindrance to growth rather than a help, and we are encouraging our American friends not to take such action."
1030,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has one of the worst search and rescue response times in the world. A recent incident off Bell Island, Newfoundland showed just how bad it was. \lineBreak After emergency flares were fired in the area, the Coast Guard called in a provincial ferry, full of passengers, to help the search and rescue effort. It then took the Canadian Coast Guard vessel over three hours to arrive on the scene. \lineBreak This is not about a limo service from a fishing lodge; this is about human lives. How long would the minister be prepared to wait in icy water before being rescued?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite knows full well that the search and rescue system is made up of a network of potential responders that includes the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard auxiliary, the Canadian Forces and any vessel of opportunity. Any vessel within the vicinity of a search and rescue call can be asked to assist. \lineBreak When the flares are discharged, the CCG will treat it as a matter of distress. If the member would like to be constructive, he would help us to take this message back to the public so that lives are not put at unnecessary risk."
1031,"Mr. Speaker, despite the recognition of Quebec as a nation, the three parties recognized in this House unanimously approved the appointment of a unilingual anglophone judge to the Supreme Court, demonstrating their lack of concern for the French language. In addition to being criticized by the public, this choice was also rejected by the Barreau du Québec, which asks the parliamentary committee tasked with examining these recommendations not to appoint the unilingual judge. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, first, I should point out for the hon. member that the Supreme Court has an excellent reputation and record in facilitating both official languages of our country. I have every confidence that will continue. \lineBreak The individuals whose names have been unanimously approved and recommended by the committees of the House of Commons are based on merit and legal excellence. That should be important for the hon. member as well."
1032,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, an information leak revealed that the government has been in possession of a report since January. This report shows that a high-speed train originating in Quebec City would benefit the entire Canadian economy. Canada is the only G8 country that does not have infrastructure for high-speed trains. That is a deficit that puts us at a competitive disadvantage.  \lineBreak Where is the Conservatives' plan for a high-speed train to bring Canada up to speed with the rest of the world?","Mr. Speaker, we received the report and are reviewing it. This report was funded by three partners: the Government of Quebec, the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada. And, as is appropriate, we will wait for the Province of Ontario to appoint its next transportation minister. We will speak with these people and a decision will be made public."
1033,"Mr. Speaker, that is a very slow read. This leaked report is suggesting that we abandon passenger rail in southern Ontario and ignore its connections with the U.S. High-speed rail from Quebec City to Windsor and on to Chicago should be a priority. The United States is moving forward, investing hundreds of millions of dollars, while Canada just studies the issue. Even Uzbekistan is rolling right past us, building high-speed rail. \lineBreak Will the minister create a stakeholder working group today to ensure that high-speed rail from Windsor to Quebec City happens and we connect into Chicago? Will the minister act and bring the stakeholders in and see some action for a change?","Mr. Speaker, that MP already knows I will work hard for a new bridge between Windsor and Detroit. He knows it is long. We have a lot of démarche to do and we have a lot of work with the U.S.A. and now we want to be getting something for Chicago. How many years does the member think it will take?  \lineBreak For now, the study has been received by the government. We will study it and then the province of Ontario will name its new minister of transport and we will discuss it with him or her."
1034,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Just at the moment, when the American conservative movement, to which the ","Mr. Speaker, I completely disagree with the premise of that question. In fact, as members know, incarceration rates in much of the United States are many times higher than those in Canada. It is a different approach. \lineBreak In any case, in terms of the financial costs of the bill, these numbers have been provided to Parliament on multiple occasions. It does not matter whether the leader of the Liberal Party believes them. Those are the numbers."
1035,"Mr. Speaker, we learned yesterday that Canada Post is going ahead with cuts to work hours in post offices in Quebec that are unfair and disproportionate compared to the rest of the country. We are talking about 53% in Quebec, while the average in other provinces is 4% to 8%. As though that were not enough, in the market assessment criteria, Canada Post was suddenly much more interested in the political affiliation of the riding in which the post office is located.  \lineBreak Is this 53% cut the Conservative Party's response to the fact that it was rejected by the vast majority of Quebeckers?","Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the member's question. \lineBreak The fact is that everyone who has a permanent job with Canada Post will continue to do so. There is some fluctuation in operations. This year there has been a reduction in postal demand in Quebec, but that just goes with the territory of a shifting market. Canada Post makes decisions based on its own operations. The government does not get involved. \lineBreak  The member should support the good work that Canada Post is doing."
1036,"Mr. Speaker, today the NDP shipbuilding critic from  \lineBreak The ","Mr. Speaker, while the leader of the NDP has chosen at the last hour to criticize the process, the fact of the matter is this. The NDP member of Parliament for  \lineBreak In the case of the NDP member for  \lineBreak This is a process that will result in enormous benefit not just for the shipbuilders that won the contracts yesterday but for all of the shipbuilding industry and all of the Canadian economy."
1037,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak When will a maritime strategy be developed so that our shipyards can reap the benefits of continuing demand and stable employment and avoid boom and bust cycles?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP's position is completely contradictory. The member for  \lineBreak The government has a program that will benefit not only the shipyards selected yesterday, but also the entire industry, taxpayers and the Canadian economy."
1038,"Mr. Speaker, we agree and everyone agrees that the awarding of government contracts should not be a partisan process. This should be true not only for shipbuilding contracts, but also for those related to fighter jets and G8 gazebos. That being said, the government must put in place a Canada-wide strategy to develop the shipbuilding industry. \lineBreak When will Davie workers have the opportunity to reap the benefits of such a strategy?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP voted against this shipbuilding program and now NDP members are contradicting each other on the process. \lineBreak The position on our side is, of course, completely clear. These are great initiatives not just for the shipbuilding industry but for the Canadian economy.  \lineBreak New Democrats have to get together and work out their policy on the other side. Meanwhile, we will get on with making sure that shipbuilding and the Canadian economy move forward."
1039,"Mr. Speaker, since 1829, the Davie shipyard has been an economic driving force in the Quebec City region. It has gone through good times and bad, but it has always endured. It helped make Canada a naval power. Today, the shipyard is offering its services to the Canadian government through a consortium that has the expertise and ability to perform. This government maintains that the selection process was open, fair and competitive. \lineBreak If that is the case, Quebec wants to know what made the difference in how the contracts were awarded.","Mr. Speaker, I am curious to find out why the member has not spoken to the NDP shipbuilding critic because he himself said yesterday that this was a great day for all of Canada. I agree with him because this shipbuilding contract will create more than 15,000 jobs across Canada in all regions and revitalize the marine industry.  \lineBreak Let us remember that Davie and all other shipyards across the country are welcome to bid on the construction of 100 smaller ships that have been set aside and the winners announced yesterday are not allowed to bid on those."
1040,"Mr. Speaker, for the past 182 years, the Davie shipyard has been at the forefront of marine technology. The Davie shipyard and its consortium offer a unique opportunity for its national and international expertise to contribute to the development of the Canadian marine industry.  \lineBreak In the context of this procurement strategy, would it not have been possible, as the former Conservative public works minister, Michael Fortier, suggested yesterday, to use the potential offered by the Davie shipyard consortium to revive this Canadian industry? ","Mr. Speaker, as I said, Davie along with other shipyards are welcome to bid on the construction of over 100 smaller ships that have been set aside for national competition. In addition to that, there is also billions of dollars in maintenance work to be done for decades to come that Davie and other shipyards can also compete for. \lineBreak I should just mention that John Dewar, the vice-president of Upper Lakes Group which now owns Davie in Ontario, said that the federal government bent over backwards to try and eliminate any political interference or manipulation of the results. "
1041,"Mr. Speaker, many people are trying to understand today why this government did not want to distribute the $35 billion in shipbuilding contracts more fairly. There should not be winners and losers when we are awarding contracts. Yesterday, the  \lineBreak How is the government's announcement great news for workers at the Davie shipyard?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote the NDP shipbuilding critic once again, because I think what he said yesterday was true. He said that yesterday was a great day for all of Canada. I agree with him. \lineBreak I also agree with the president and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, who said:"
1042,"Mr. Speaker, shipbuilding is a key, strategic industry in our country and it must remain stable. Unfortunately, the shipbuilding industry in Quebec is vulnerable right now. After 182 years of existence, the Davie shipyard is in a fragile position. \lineBreak I would like to know how the ","Mr. Speaker, we cannot understate enough the opportunities that come out of the national shipbuilding strategy for all regions, and in fact for the entire marine sector, including Davie Canada. \lineBreak Davie yards, along with other shipyards across the country, are welcome to bid on the construction of over 100 smaller ships that have been set aside for national competition, which are excluded from the two winners yesterday. \lineBreak In addition, there will be billions of dollars in maintenance work to be done for decades to come, and of course, they are welcome to bid on those contracts as well."
1043,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Will the minister now admit his gamble on F-35 jets is riddled with holes? Conservatives are ready to spend billions without a single competitive bid.  \lineBreak Is the cost per jet $65 million or $148 million? Canadians do not know. The  \lineBreak If the process was fair for shipbuilding, why do we not have the same for jets?","Mr. Speaker, I, too, applaud the fair and transparent way in which the national shipbuilding procurement was awarded. \lineBreak On the F-35s, I remind the member opposite that the extensive and rigorous competitive process took place and it happened under the previous Liberal government. Now the Liberal members in this House have cold feet about the program they started. \lineBreak The F-35s will provide our men and women in uniform with the best equipment to do their jobs and return home to their families, as we have supported them during their campaign in Libya."
1044,"Mr. Speaker, we have learned that about 20 public servants made sure that the shipbuilding contracts were awarded as fairly as possible, primarily because the Conservatives were not involved in the decision-making process. In the meantime, the government is stubbornly wanting to award a $30 billion contract for the F-35s without any kind of framework or bidding process. \lineBreak Why is it that what is good for shipbuilding is not good for our air force?","Mr. Speaker, the previous answer applies. I am sorry that the member was not listening."
1045,"Mr. Speaker, after the discovery of infectious salmon anemia in two wild sockeye smolts, U.S. federal agencies are preparing an emergency research effort into this threat of their wild, hatchery and farmed salmon. This is the single most feared virus in the fish industry. The U.S. recognizes the urgent need to protect its coastal economy and jobs, but the Canadian government is mute. Does it not understand the scale of this new threat? When will the minister tell Canadians exactly what emergency action he will take?","Mr. Speaker, stringent federal regulations are in place to protect Canada's aquatic species from disease. Infectious salmon anemia, ISA, has never been found in B.C. aquaculture salmon. Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the Pacific region has been testing wild sockeye salmon for ISA. In fact, 300 samples tested this year have all tested negative.  \lineBreak At this time the reported finding the member refers to is far from conclusive. Fisheries and Oceans Canada will conduct testing in the national ISA reference laboratory."
1046,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are shortchanging our brave veterans by cutting more than $200 million from their budget. \lineBreak Today at committee the Liberals fought back and won a small victory for the vets. Our motion to study these massive cuts passed because Conservative members did not show up to the veterans affairs committee on time today to defeat it. \lineBreak Would the minister commit to appear at committee and explain why he is cutting support to our veterans, and will he be on time?","Mr. Speaker, our veterans have been winning massively for six years with the Conservative government.  \lineBreak If the member wants to get the number right, $500 million times six gives $3 billion to our veterans and $2 billion with the new veterans charter. If the member wants to help our veterans, he must sit up in his chair when we are improving budget initiatives for our veterans. \lineBreak We are on the side of veterans."
1047,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak What is the minister doing to stop these unfair and unbalanced cuts that target just one province?","Mr. Speaker, what I say is true in English and true in French. \lineBreak All permanent jobs at Canada Post are protected. Our government is committed to ensuring high quality mail service to all Canadians and businesses. Operating decisions at Canada Post are made by Canada Post. \lineBreak I hope this member will appreciate Canada Post and not get into mudslinging. It is beneath him really."
1048,"Mr. Speaker, the minister's vague answers show us at least one thing: he has no argument to justify the unfair treatment of Quebec. Postal service is essential across the country. There is no justification for treating a province this way. I repeat: the cuts in Quebec are 53%. Elsewhere in the country the cuts range between 4% and 8%. \lineBreak Does the minister not think that every province is entitled to the same service from Canada Post?","Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member when he says postal services are essential to Canada. That is why I was very concerned when his party, last spring, went to all sorts of effort to prevent Canada Post from allowing Canadians to receive the mail. The member and his party created a historic filibuster to support their big union bosses to prevent Canadians from getting the mail. \lineBreak Really, Canada Post is essential. I wish the hon. member would help ensure that Canada Post and all Canadians can reach their full potential."
1049,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Yesterday we learned that the axe will fall on the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. Atlantic Canadian families count on ACOA. \lineBreak Why is this government punishing the Atlantic region?","Mr. Speaker, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency announced that 42 positions would be eliminated, but small businesses and communities in the Atlantic will not be the least bit affected in terms of the programs and services they receive. It will have no impact on them, nor on the extraordinary opportunity announced yesterday that will see thousands of jobs created in the Atlantic region and across Canada through our naval strategy."
1050,"Mr. Speaker, ACOA serves four provinces in Atlantic Canada, and 100 of the 800 positions at the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency are being eliminated, the latest victims of the government's approach to job 100. \lineBreak Since 2006, Conservatives have cut ACOA's budget by a whopping 30%. ACOA is vital to economic development and job creation in Atlantic Canada, and cutting it will kill jobs. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives jeopardizing the future of our region with these reckless cuts to ACOA, which helps job creation?","Mr. Speaker, these are not reckless cuts. This is streamlining the operation to give better service and better programs to Atlantic Canadians out of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.  \lineBreak These 42 positions that will be eliminated will not take away from the services being provided to entrepreneurs and communities in Atlantic Canada, nor will they take away from the extraordinary opportunities that we got yesterday out of the Conservative government's naval strategy."
1051,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday we witnessed a bizarre spectacle in the House when the NDP member for  \lineBreak Unlike that member, our government understands the importance of the Port of Churchill as a valuable asset. Despite the NDP, the Port of Churchill will remain the Prairies-Arctic gateway to the world. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, I know the member for  \lineBreak This government will continue to support Churchill. Building on the $38 million this government committed in previous budgets, we at Agriculture Canada will provide $5 million per year, for the next five years, to incent more than just Wheat Board grains moving up the railway to Churchill. That is a great initiative. Transport Canada will provide an additional $4 million, over three years, to strengthen the infrastructure at the port. \lineBreak The people of Churchill are hoping that their NDP member does not vote no again."
1052,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian index of well-being, published by the University of Waterloo, shows increasing inequality in Canada under this government. The benefits of economic growth are not evenly distributed. The top 1% of income earners benefited from 30% of the economic growth and Canadian families have a higher level of debt than ever before.  \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives offering such generous tax breaks to the banks, while leaving Canadian families to fend for themselves?","Mr. Speaker, unlike the NDP opposition, we believe the best social program is a job. Canadian families want jobs, not higher taxes that kill jobs, like the $10 billion tax increase that was in the NDP platform in the last election. \lineBreak We have created about 650,000 net new jobs in Canada since the end of the recession, 90% being full-time jobs and almost 80% in the private sector. Those jobs support employment in our country which supports the quality of life of Canadian families."
1053,"Mr. Speaker, once again, that is cold Conservative comfort for Canadians. It is not much of an answer. \lineBreak The Conservatives' stubborn insistence on slashing taxes for profitable corporations is just another gift to wealthy CEOs and shareholders. It increases inequality and does nothing to help the 99%. Experts keep telling the government that there is no economic logic to such a policy.  \lineBreak Will the minister please explain to struggling Canadian families why CEOs come before them?","Mr. Speaker, would the NDP please explain to the Canadian people why it voted against the working income tax benefit to help people get off social assistance and get jobs in this country? \lineBreak This is a very important social reform in our budget that the NDP voted against. It is a reform that is looked upon by experts across this country as the most important initiative that has been taken in Canada to help people get off welfare and social assistance, and get jobs to support their families.  \lineBreak The NDP members come here and rail against corporations. They do not care about the poor people in this country. When we actually bring something to this House, they vote against it."
1054,"Mr. Speaker, the American government should be congratulated for going after offshore tax dodgers. However, our own government's feeble attempt pales by comparison. Unfortunately, thousands of law-abiding Canadians are now being unnecessarily harassed by the IRS using laws intended to catch U.S. tax cheats. \lineBreak Has the government negotiated a true amnesty to protect law-abiding Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, it is the sovereign right of the U.S. government to impose tax rules on American citizens. This is a question where it is unfair to some with dual citizenship because they have had no income earned in the United States for a long time, many of whom were unaware of their obligation to file tax returns in the United States, and there are some penalties that can be attached. \lineBreak We have had discussions with the American treasury authorities. We have heard already from the American ambassador in Canada on the subject and from the treasury in the United States to the effect that they are looking at being more reasonable with respect to the punitive penalties that are possible by the IRS under the legislation. We see some progress there."
1055,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians who have not received any income or had any assets in the United States for years are suddenly being threatened with enormous fines for not filing their tax returns. Consider the case of a woman who has been living and working in Canada since 1968 who might have to pay $70,000. Several of the Canadians in question are seniors and their retirement incomes are now in jeopardy. \lineBreak Will the government negotiate a tax return amnesty for these Canadian citizens?","Mr. Speaker, as I said a moment ago to the member opposite, it is the right of Canada to impose tax obligations on our citizens. It is the right of the United States to do the same thing. These are people who are American citizens and they choose to maintain their American citizenship. If they do that, they are subject to some rules. \lineBreak The difficulty is, as the member has mentioned, many of these individuals have not lived in the United States, have not filed in the United States, have not earned any income in the United States, and were unaware of their obligation. It is for those people that we are trying to get some co-operation, leniency quite frankly, with respect to penalties from the American authorities. As I said a moment ago, we are making some progress."
1056,"Mr. Speaker, the prestigious journal  \lineBreak Will the government finally let Dr. Tarasick speak freely and ensure that scientists are never muzzled again?","Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times in the House, our government is very proud of the scientists at Environment Canada and the work they do. \lineBreak Our government has taken concrete action over and over again to protect Canada's environment. We have protected record amounts of parkland. We have assessed hundreds of new and existing substances for potential risks to human health through chemical management. We have developed a new air quality management system to reduce the costs of the environment.  \lineBreak We are focused on delivering tangible results, including the area of ozone management."

That will return more money to them and keep those smaller farms and communities alive and vibrant.","Mr. Speaker, barely finished butchering the Canadian Wheat Board, the Conservatives have already set their sights on supply management. \lineBreak Yesterday, the member for  \lineBreak Could the minister forecast when his attack on dairy, egg and poultry farms across the rest of Canada will begin?"
1059,"Order. There needs to be a lot more order during the questions and answers. I can barely hear the question. I will allow the hon. minister to answer, but we need more order.","You are right, Mr. Speaker, it was loud, but it was not clear. \lineBreak This government is well respected by the supply management sector as we reciprocate and respect it for the great job it is doing. We are the only party that listed supply management support in our last campaign platform. We brought it forward in our throne speech. Those members voted against it. What a bunch of hypocrites."
1060,"Mr. Speaker, the President of Treasury Board has quite the sense of humour. Today, he talked about open government. He was very open with the G8 funds—he turned on the taps for the projects of his friends, the mayor of Huntsville and the hotel manager. Unfortunately, as is often the case with the Conservative government, there is a double standard. It was not as open during the Auditor General's investigation. \lineBreak He is clearly not forthcoming with the public when he refuses to explain himself. But now, with these announcements, will he finally post the documents he kept from us on the Open Government website, www.open.gc.ca?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite speaks about the sense of humour of the  \lineBreak Infrastructure Canada co-operated fully with the auditor general. The auditor general did a thorough review of this issue. She made a number of observations and recommendations, which this government completely accepted, on how we could be even more open and more transparent to the House of Commons."
1061,"Mr. Speaker, the government has a credibility problem. Asking a Muskoka maverick to sell open government is like asking Homer Simpson to promote nuclear safety. It is now 133 days since he went AWOL from accountability and it is contagious. We now know he runs from the media when he does presentations. \lineBreak What part of openness includes hiding documents from the auditor general or running a slush fund from a BlackBerry? When will the government get open with the Canadian people and hold this rogue minister accountable?","Mr. Speaker, we approved some 23,000 infrastructure programs in every corner of the country. We gave every province its full per capita share. We worked with NDP, Liberal and Conservative governments from coast to coast to coast. We were able to deliver a lot of new jobs. In doing so, on 32 of those 23,000 projects, the auditor general levelled some serious observations. We fully accepted those observations, and we will do an even better job next time."
1062,"Mr. Speaker, this summer the world faced the worst humanitarian crisis 60 years. In East Africa, 30 million people are impacted by conflict, drought and famine. The government has been responding to help meet the needs of the victims and refugees.  \lineBreak The ","Mr. Speaker, Canada is doing its part. Our government's initial $72 million support has helped provide food to 11.5 million people and nutrition, clean water and medical care to over 2 million people in the region. Matching the generosity of Canadians, I am happy to report an additional $70.5 million will be put into the famine relief fund to support ongoing aid relief. \lineBreak Recently, humanitarian workers have been targeted and kidnapped in the region. I call on all parties to allow for safe humanitarian access."
1063,"Mr. Speaker, I have written to the government requesting that the October 31 deadline for the Canadian Forces appreciation fare on  \lineBreak One of my constituents, who recently returned from Afghanistan, inquired about the fare and was told the crossing he wanted to take had its quota of veterans and that he would have to pay. That is some appreciation.  \lineBreak Over 30,000 trips have been taken by veterans since the start of the program. Clearly the need exists. Will the minister commit today to extend the program, eliminate the quota and honour all our veterans who give so much to our country?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. Veterans and their families are our government's priority. They are the focus of our actions. I invite my colleague to forward her concern to me and we will look at the situation."
1064,"Mr. Speaker, this week, 118 countries are meeting in Brazil to develop an action plan on the social determinants of health. Nevertheless, this government did not feel it was necessary to send representatives. In Canada, 20% of health care expenditures are related to social issues such as homelessness and unemployment.  \lineBreak The World Health Organization recognizes that social inequality leads to health inequities. The costs are astronomical. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, we do participate in a number of conferences internationally. Most recently, we were at a conference in New York, at the United Nations, on the declaration around poverty reduction initiatives across countries.  \lineBreak Our government has worked hard to protect and promote the health and safety of all Canadians who make huge investments internationally, as well as in Canada.

As a proud supporter of the upcoming 2015 games in Toronto, we have committed funding to sports infrastructure, legacy and essential federal services. We look forward to welcoming these games to Canada."

By wearing purple, we show our support for LGBT teens who are the victims of bullying. \lineBreak The tragic suicide of Jamie Hubley, a 15-year old who took his life in Ottawa last Saturday after being bullied because of his sexual orientation, shows to what extent gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual teens are crying out for help. It is high time we demonstrated leadership to protect our young people.  \lineBreak Can the government tell us how it plans to address the bullying and harassment our young people are experiencing?","Mr. Speaker, I know I would speak for all members of the House to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Jamie Hubley. Bullying, homophobia, intolerance and incivility have no place in our schools. It underlies the real challenge of depression and mental health, especially among young people. \lineBreak  Let us resolve, as a society, to promote tolerance and acceptance of each and every one of our fellow citizens."
1067,"Mr. Speaker, blinded by ideology, the Conservatives refuse to believe the statistics, refuse to listen to the Quebec bar and refuse to heed the warnings from places like Texas that have tried this approach and rejected it. Today, Quebec's National Assembly passed a unanimous motion demanding “the withdrawal of the provisions of federal Bill  \lineBreak Will the minister continue to impose his approach, a major failure, or will he listen to Quebec and its National Assembly?","Mr. Speaker, I know anything about the fight of crime always upsets what is left of the Bloc Québécois. \lineBreak  The parts of the bill that we have before Parliament have been reviewed by my provincial counterparts over the years, and I am appreciative of their support. \lineBreak  Canadians elected us on this mandate to move forward to get tough on crime. That is why we are here and that is what we will continue to do."
1068,"I would like to draw the attention of hon. members to the presence in the gallery of the honourable Kathleen Casey, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island.","I believe the hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh may wish to pose his inaugural Thursday question. \lineBreak I see some members standing on points of order. We will do the Thursday question first, and then we will deal with any points of order that may have arisen out of question period."
1069,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a historic day for Libya. The future of that country now belongs to all Libyans. The time now has come for Canada to withdraw its military operation and it is time to focus on diplomacy and helping rebuild that country. \lineBreak All across the Middle East, we are seeing ordinary citizens demand freedom. Canada must be ready to support them in all ways. Can the minister now inform the House what Canada will do to foster democracy and support Libya as well as the Arab Spring?","Mr. Speaker, obviously the military mission is very quickly coming to an end. The UN-sanctioned mission to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's regime has certainly accomplished its goal.  \lineBreak We are working now on diplomatic efforts. I visited Tripoli just last week, where we announced up to $10 million to support two things: one, democratic development in Libya, and two, the demilitarization of the country. Those are obviously two important priorities. \lineBreak Our embassy is now back open and our ambassador is on the ground. We are going to do everything we can to support the new government."
1070,"Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the NDP, I would like to say how proud we are of the role our troops have played in Libya. We agreed with the United Nations: we had to intervene to stop a dictator from killing his own people. \lineBreak Throughout the Middle East we are seeing people fighting for freedom. Canada has to be prepared to support them. Is it possible for the minister to be more clear about what our country is going to do to help Libya?","Mr. Speaker, we are also very proud of the Canadian Forces who, once again, have contributed to democracy and human rights. They have done very good work under the leadership of General Charles Bouchard. He was the leader of the entire NATO mission. We were very proud of their contribution.  \lineBreak We will continue to work with the new Libyan government on advancing democracy and demilitarizing the country. These two goals are very important. We have already committed to that through our ambassador. I was in Tripoli last week to offer help to the new government."
1071,"Mr. Speaker, in August we saw that the number of people receiving employment insurance benefits increased by 6.6%. This number continues to rise, but the government is cutting employment insurance services and turning its back on Canadian families when they need it most. This government needs to stop hiding behind excuses. \lineBreak When will it stop giving tax cuts to its corporate buddies and help the people who need employment insurance?","Mr. Speaker, our government was given a strong mandate to create jobs and lower taxes, a low tax plan for jobs and growth. This plan is working, with the creation of over 650,000 new jobs since July 2009. We are focused on what matters to Canadians: job growth, expanding the economy, investing in skills training, and helping those who are the hardest hit. \lineBreak In budget 2011, our hiring tax credit for small businesses provides a one-year EI tax break for over 525,000 small businesses. These initiatives are creating jobs."
1072,"Mr. Speaker, families have known for a long time that under the Conservative government they are just not getting ahead. Yesterday, the Canadian Index of Wellbeing reported the same findings the Conference Board did a month ago. They reported that the gap between the rich and the rest of us is growing and employment insurance claims are rising dramatically. This is the reality for Canadian families, and still the Conservatives refuse to act. \lineBreak When will the government start fighting for families?","Mr. Speaker, we continue to fight for families, but the NDP fights against everything we want to put forward in legislation that does help families. Canadian families want jobs. The best social program that any government can provide is an environment where the private sector can grow jobs.  \lineBreak We have all heard time and again that over 650,000 jobs were created, not totally because of our economic action plan but because of all the implementation. I would remind hon. members that the NDP voted against every one of those initiatives."
1073,"Mr. Speaker, the truth of the Conservative Party's record on veterans affairs is rather quite dismal when we look at the fact that more and more veterans are now using food banks. In the city of Calgary alone, there is a food bank for veterans only. In 2005, it had 58 members and in 2010 it had over 200.  \lineBreak More and more veterans are becoming homeless, more and more veterans are frustrated with the system. Instead of streamlining the system to the point where veterans get more of the benefits, the government is cutting the department by $226 million. \lineBreak If it really wants to do something, it should cut the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, get rid of the political appointees, and deal with the veterans—",The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs.
1074,"Mr. Speaker, to be very clear, we are not cutting benefits to veterans. We are looking at efficiencies at the department, cutting red tape, and making things much more efficient for our veterans.  \lineBreak When it comes to homelessness and food banks, our government record is incredibly clear. We are the ones who created the new veterans emergency access fund that helps veterans and their families when there are no other funds available to them. We are the ones who have actually doubled the number of operational stress injury clinics. \lineBreak No government in Canada's history has done more for veterans than the Stephen Harper government.",Order. I would remind the hon. member not to use proper names but ridings or titles. \lineBreak The hon. member for Pontiac.
1075,"Mr. Speaker, that is just more government rhetoric. It is sad that veterans are not able to see positive changes in their daily lives. \lineBreak This government plans to cuts jobs at Veterans Affairs Canada because the Conservatives claim there are fewer veterans in the country today, but that is the exact opposite of what the Veterans Ombudsman is saying. There are currently 700,000 veterans in the country, and that number is growing. Why is this Conservative government turning its back on veterans?","Mr. Speaker, again, to be clear, we will maintain benefits to our veterans, including the enhanced benefits that our government introduced just two weeks ago. Changes at the Department of Veterans Affairs, as I mentioned, are focused on improving efficiency, cutting red tape, and improving service to veterans. Our government continues to deliver quality care to our veterans and a key component of that is our operations in Charlottetown."
1076,"Mr. Speaker, culture does not grow only in the big cities. It is created in all corners of the country, including rural Canada. The cultural capital program is a boost to the rural economies and an essential part of preserving rural Canadian culture, yet the government has decided to wipe out the small communities category. \lineBreak Small Canadian communities have made a large contribution to our country's cultural fabric. Why are they being shut out of this important program?","Mr. Speaker, no government in history has actually done more for culture than this government. During the economic downturn, we are the only government that not only maintained funding for arts and culture but increased funding for arts and culture. \lineBreak We understand how important it is, not only to the large cities, to urban areas, but to all of our rural areas. That is why in communities across this country festivals are being supported, the arts are being supported, and we are very proud of our record. "
1077,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives continue to turn their backs on families with these cuts. This week we learned that the Department of Canadian Heritage is making cuts to the cultural capitals of Canada program. It is cutting cultural capitals of less than 50,000 people. Rouyn-Noranda is one of them. \lineBreak The community of Rouyn-Noranda depends on the program to promote the arts and create jobs. Why is the government abandoning this community?","Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate for the hon. member. We have actually increased funding for arts and culture in Canada. We are the only G7 country in the midst of an economic downturn to increase funding. We understand how important this sector is to the Canadian economy. It is responsible for thousands of jobs across this country.  \lineBreak The real question is, why does the NDP always vote against initiatives that would help support our artists? When we talk about increasing funding to the arts community, why does it always vote against it?"
1078,"Mr. Speaker, cuts to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have left our fishermen feeling like they have been set adrift in a sea of uncertainty, written off by the Conservative government. \lineBreak The boom has been lowered on the resource conservation council and on the search and rescue marine sub-entre in my riding of  \lineBreak Which part of our fisheries, of our culture, will the Conservatives set adrift next?","Mr. Speaker, strategic review is an opportunity to assess the performance of all departments within government. It also allows us to ensure that we are responding to the priorities of Canadians. \lineBreak We have a responsibility to spend money prudently and where it will do the most good. We must ensure that government programs are efficient, effective, and achieving the results that Canadians expect from us. \lineBreak DFO is making steady progress in modernizing and improving our program and policy approaches to meet the needs of Canadians today and in the future."
1079,"Mr. Speaker, early this afternoon I will have the pleasure of opening debate on my private member's bill calling for an inquiry into the Newfoundland and Labrador fishery.  \lineBreak The Newfoundland and Labrador fishery rebuilding act proposes that today, 20 years after the shutdown of the commercial groundfish fishery, we begin the process of rebuilding. Unfortunately, the Conservative government appears to be sailing in the opposite direction. \lineBreak Will the minister do the right thing and agree to an inquiry to restore the once great stocks that were our dowry with Confederation?","Mr. Speaker, the government has learned many lessons from the poor practices that had led to the collapse of the groundfish fishery in the 1990s. While some may prefer to live in the past, our government has no intention of conducting a formal review into the collapse of the cod fishery. \lineBreak In some areas, for example, on the eastern shelf, we have seen some positive indicators that our efforts are starting to pay off, and we will continue with fisheries reform and further implementation of sustainability policies."
1080,"Mr. Speaker, it is time for the minister to get a grip on reality. Fishers are worried about the cuts at Fisheries and Oceans Canada. People from the Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands have already suffered enough because of poor management of fish stocks. Now the government is adding to that by cuts in search and rescue. The industry's future and the fishers' safety are being threatened by these cuts. \lineBreak Will the government commit to maintaining funding at Fisheries and Oceans Canada to guarantee the future of our fishers?","Mr. Speaker, I believe that our department and this government have made substantial gains in the fisheries. The programs that we are implementing will make the fishery more efficient, more effective, and better for fishers in the industry. Our programs, and those of search and rescue, are fully subscribed and are working well."
1081,"Mr. Speaker, according to media reports, the government now agrees that Quebec should retain its proportional representation in the House. This is what we Liberals insisted had to be changed from the previous plan. Why does the government now want Ontario to lose five seats and B.C. to lose two, while Alberta gains one? \lineBreak Could the minister assure us that he will release his bill soon enough for the House to examine it in detail, and will he release the population data which should be the basis for seat allocation?","Mr. Speaker, as this House well knows, our government has made three distinct commitments. First, we have ensured, or have committed to ensure, that the faster-growing provinces, both now and in the future, will see increased seat representation based on the population. Second, we have committed to ensure that our smaller provinces will be protected from losing any seats. Finally, we have committed to ensure fair and proportional representation in the province of Quebec according to its population. \lineBreak Those are the commitments we have made and those are the commitments we will honour."
1082,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency confirmed that the agency will face $13 million in cuts next year. That is 43% of its budget gone. That is one-third of its staff gone. The agency's job is to look into potentially harmful policies and projects before they get the green light. \lineBreak The government has abandoned environmental protection. How can the agency do its job properly with huge cuts to staff and programs?","Mr. Speaker, our government is taking concrete action to protect Canada's environment. With regard to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, budget 2007 provided $11 million in additional funding for the agency to take on more responsibilities related to the review of major resource projects. \lineBreak  The agency was one of six departments funded to deliver on a new government mandate to improve the regulatory process for major resource projects. The funding was time limited so that the government could assess at the end of the five years whether it was generating the intended results. We look forward to the findings of this committee."
1083,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency plays a crucial role. Investments worth $500 million are planned for natural resource projects, yet this government is strangling the agency that oversees those projects. Now the agency's managers are worried about the amount of work that lies ahead.  \lineBreak Is the government's economic projection false, or does the government prefer to let industry do what it wants without worrying about the environment?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, we provided additional funding to this agency in budget 2007. It was a five-year funding process, which we are reviewing right now, and we look forward to the committee's findings."
1084,"Mr. Speaker, EU nations are worried, and with good reason, about the environmental impact of the oil sands. While the minister prefers to do nothing, the gap between greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2020 and the reality is 75%. \lineBreak Why is the minister not focusing his efforts on reaching those reduction targets instead of attacking the European Union's fuel quality directive?","Mr. Speaker, our first interest, of course, is in protecting the Canadian economy, Canadian jobs and the environment at the same time. We are committed to working with all levels of government and industry to ensure that the oil sands are developed in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner. It is a strategic resource in our country. Currently, 390,000 jobs are tied to and supported by oil sands development. \lineBreak  I wish the opposition would join with us in supporting Canadian jobs, supporting the Canadian economy and helping us move ahead in the future."
1085,"Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that the government is in denial, but the facts are clear. The government has failed to properly understand and regulate the environmental impacts of oil sands development. It has weakened its climate change targets by 90% since 2007 and its inaction has given Canada a black eye on the world stage. \lineBreak  When will the government take climate change seriously at home instead of attacking our allies abroad?","Mr. Speaker, as I have said, we are protecting the Canadian economy and the Canadian environment. \lineBreak One of the things that really concerns me is how the NDP members do not seem to be able to be united on any of these issues. We have heard them contradict each other on the shipbuilding process. We have heard them contradicting each other on the merit of Supreme Court justices. We have heard them contradict each other on marketing freedom for western Canadian farmers. We have heard them contradict each other in terms of the merger with the Liberals. \lineBreak The opposition does not have credibility on this issue. We will continue to represent Canada. We will continue to build the Canadian economy and we look forward to a bright future."
1086,"Mr. Speaker, on the omnibus crime bill, Bill  \lineBreak Instead of putting more police officers in our communities, with Bill  \lineBreak When is the government going to come clear on what Bill "," Mr. Speaker, in committee yesterday the crown prosecutor certainly expressed some concern about overload, but the prosecutors were in essence pleading for more resources to ensure that the mandate they carefully carry out to protect Canadian citizens is carried out, as is the intent of Bill  \lineBreak Certainly we will dedicate all the resources necessary to ensure that cities and communities are safe, because we will stand up for citizens and we will protect victims."
1087,"Mr. Speaker, Quebec's justice minister has clearly stated that the Conservatives' crime bill does not pass the test. The Quebec government recommends an approach based on the rehabilitation and reintegration of young offenders, rather than one based on repression. Quebec's approach has proven to be very successful for many years. \lineBreak Will this government respond to Quebeckers' legitimate demands and amend this bill?","Mr. Speaker, here is something new: Canadians gave us the mandate to protect people and keep our streets safe. This is really nothing new. It is a clear mandate. Clearly, Quebec has some concerns, particularly with regard to young offenders, but this bill targets violent and repeat young offenders. Why? Because they are a threat to ordinary people. \lineBreak With regard to young offenders, clearly they may be incarcerated; however, young people age 18 and younger will not be put in adult prisons."
1088,"Mr. Speaker, it seems that the hon. member's math skills are just as good as the  \lineBreak The  \lineBreak When will this government stop doing whatever it wants and listen to the opinion of a province that knows what it is talking about? ","Mr. Speaker, one thing is certain: Quebec knows what it is talking about, as does the rest of Canada. Perhaps all Canadians did not support us, but 70% of them definitely did not support the NDP. We are still targeting violent, repeat offenders. We are standing up for victims and ordinary people. We are asking the NDP to do the same."
1089,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians remain concerned about air services and Air Canada plays a vital role in the Canadian economy. The  \lineBreak Could the Minister of Labour please provide the House with an update on the status of this matter?","Mr. Speaker, our government remains supportive of free collective bargaining. We have always said that the best deal the parties will get are the ones they find themselves. That is why I am so pleased to announce today to all Canadians that Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have negotiated a resolution to avoid a work stoppage and to maintain full service for passengers of Air Canada.  \lineBreak We congratulate both parties for their diligent efforts and their efforts at resolving the labour dispute and avoiding this work stoppage. Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to protect the economic recovery of the country, and that is exactly what we are doing."
1090,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak How can the Conservatives say that the project came in on budget?","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce to members of the House that of the 23,000 projects that this government funded under Canada's economic action plan, we did not pay one cent of money over budget."
1091,"Mr. Speaker, no matter how much the government insists that all expenses were justified, the fact remains that the  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, Infrastructure Canada and the Government of Canada co-operated fully with the good work of the Auditor General.  \lineBreak Throughout her 10 years as Auditor General, Sheila Fraser did an outstanding job fighting for the interests of taxpayers. She came forward with a solid report, which made a good number of observations on how this government could do things better, on how this government could be more open and on how this government could be more transparent to Parliament. This government has accepted every one of her recommendations in this regard."
1092,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have fought and voted against every advancement of gay rights in Canada, from pension benefits to marriage to transgender rights, and yet, yesterday, the Conservatives came out in support of the “It Gets Better” gay youth campaign. \lineBreak If the Conservatives are now serious about helping gay youth, will they recognize the support that pride festivals provide to struggling young gays? Will the Conservatives restore the funding that they themselves cut for these important pride festivals across Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate the answer we gave earlier. \lineBreak This government has provided extraordinary amounts of funding in the arts and culture sector across this country, and we are very proud to do so. In my own riding and in ridings across this country, festivals are being supported.  \lineBreak We get a lot of applications for a lot of different things. We support a lot of different cultural festivals in communities across Canada. We look at all of those applications on their merit and we support the ones that Canadians ask us to support and the ones that meet the criteria of the programs that we establish."
1093,"Mr. Speaker, this government clearly lacks vision when it comes to immigration. Parents and grandparents have been waiting for years to join their families in Canada. Instead of examining all options to reunite family members living apart, the government has decided to limit the number of applications. That is unacceptable. \lineBreak Why is this government insisting on imposing a limit on the number of claimants rather than searching for real solutions for family reunification?","Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question, but it is a little premature at this point. A study is taking place at citizenship and immigration and it will take place over the next number of weeks. We are looking at all options, bringing in a number of witnesses. \lineBreak In this country, over the last six years in government, we have averaged 254,000 new immigrants coming to this country to be settled. That is 14% higher than the previous administration. I do not think we need to take any advice, or at least any lectures, from the opposition on what it is to become a Canadian."
1094,"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to families, the government just does not get it. Parents and grandparents are a vital support for families in Canada, not a burden on the system as some Conservatives suggest. Elderly family members provide child care and the family support that new Canadians need to enter the workforce. Since the government has failed to establish a national child care system, help from older relatives is more important than ever. \lineBreak Why does the minister refuse to recognize the important contributions that immigrant seniors make to our communities?","Mr. Speaker, there is not an immigration minister on this side of the House who has not stood up and ensured that we are up and working hard for seniors in this country. When we look at the averages over the last number of years, we are accepting new Canadians whether they are young or old.  \lineBreak What I would appreciate, while we are working through this process at the citizenship and immigration committee and while the minister is making the determination on how we deal with backlogs, that members would participate in a way that is meaningful and is helpful, rather than just sitting on the other side of the House and criticizing."
1095,"Mr. Speaker, earlier this week our government delivered on a long-standing promise to farmers by introducing the marketing freedom for grain farmers act. Unfortunately, factions allied with the old Canadian Wheat Board guard are working to destroy the rural economy of the Prairies by opposing our bill. The actions being taken by these people and CWB chair Allen Oberg are disrupting what farmers need most, market certainty. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, the marketing freedom for grain farmers act takes direct action to improve rail access for farmers and to provide market certainty.  \lineBreak First, the bill would guarantee farmers' rights to producer cars under the Canadian Grain Commission. Second, our government is implementing the rail freight service review. We are appointing a facilitator to improve those commercial relationships. Most important, this legislation would allow farmers the freedom to make their own shipping and marketing decisions. \lineBreak  Unfortunately, there are organizations in western Canada that have stood in the way of progress for years. It is no surprise they would be taking action and standing once again against the best interests of western Canadian producers. \lineBreak  However, our government is bringing marketing freedom to western Canadian farmers whether the opposition likes that or not."
1096,"Mr. Speaker, I stand today to plead the case of a lady who has been waiting two months for her employment insurance. She has been diagnosed with cancer. She is physically and emotionally exhausted, and now she is broke. Yesterday, she spent three hours phoning the Service Canada 800 number, only to get busy signals. When she finally got through, the agent told her that the office workload was unbearable. \lineBreak I am sure the minister will commit to looking into this specific case. However, does she not see that the 600 jobs she is carving out of the Service Canada EI processing centres is making a bad situation impossible?","Mr. Speaker, the government sympathizes with that mother who is diligently fighting with cancer. Each case is assessed based on the current legislation and the payment of benefits. These will be evaluated for each individual situation. \lineBreak Our government is currently reviewing the legislation to ensure the needs of Canadians are properly met under the program. We are modernizing, and there will be no Service Canada offices closing and no impact on in-person services offered."
1097,"Mr. Speaker, Goulard Lumber in Sturgeon Falls is losing its Quebec-based customers, who are now buying cheaper lumber from Maine. Why? Because the black liquor subsidy from the U.S. government lets them undercut the price of Canadian producers.  \lineBreak Like other companies across Canada, Goulard Lumber is not getting a fair deal from a government that worships free trade. When will the government adopt a forestry strategy that puts Canadians first and supports our communities?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite knows that our focus is the Canadian economy and creating jobs and economic growth. That is why we have taken unprecedented investments to support Canada's forestry industry. It has created results. More than 13,000 jobs have been created in the forestry sector. We have a 600% increase, for example, in softwood exports to China alone. \lineBreak Our government is going to continue to support the forestry sector across Canada. It is an important part of continuing the economic growth that we have in this country."
1098,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak Will the minister now make the same clear commitment and ensure that these basic human rights are a priority at the Commonwealth meetings next week in Perth?","Mr. Speaker, human rights will be front and centre at the Commonwealth summit next week in Perth, Australia. We will be considering the adoption of the report by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, on which Senator Hugh Segal assisted, with nine other leaders in the Commonwealth.  \lineBreak The rights of gays and lesbians are tremendously important. It is completely unacceptable that homosexuality continues to be criminalized in a majority of Commonwealth countries. We will certainly take that issue to the summit."
1099,"Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers understand the importance of a free trade agreement with the European Union, but they are not prepared to accept just anything. They cherish the richness of their culture and obviously want to protect agricultural supply management, public services and water resources. The Conservatives are negotiating in a vacuum and are not giving the public any information. They are merely providing assurances, as the parliamentary secretary did earlier, that important progress is being made in key sectors, without providing any details. In short, we fear the devil is in the details. \lineBreak Does the minister understand that the implications of this agreement are too important to keep Parliament and the public in the dark?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians know, farmers know, and the House knows our strong commitment to supply management. We promote supply management and we have defended it in our trade agreements. This is no different in our negotiations with the European Union."
1100,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives thought they could get away with their anti-democratic attack on western Canadian family farms with no fuss. Funny how people react when the government ignores them. \lineBreak Protests against the Conservative plan to kill the single desk system by farmers today in Saskatchewan will lead to more next week in the face of the government's false claims that farmers support its ideological plan. Farmers do not support killing small farms and small town economies.  \lineBreak Is the minister now planning to ignore their cries from the farms and streets of the Prairies?","Mr. Speaker, this legislation would deliver on our government's long-standing commitment to bring marketing choice and freedom to western Canadian farmers. Once passed, the bill would allow prairie farmers to seek their own contracts for grains through the open market. The Wheat Board is going to remain a voluntary pooling option for Canadian farmers. \lineBreak  We hope that the opposition will not drag this out. We know that the chairman of the Wheat Board has said that he wants the opposition to drag it out, which would completely disrupt the markets. That is totally irresponsible. We do not want to see that happen. We hope that the opposition is not going to join with that kind of irresponsibility.  \lineBreak We are looking out for prairie farmers. Would the opposition join with us in doing that?"
1101,"Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that mandatory minimum penalties remove a judge's discretionary power to determine an appropriate sentence based on the crime and the circumstances. Yesterday, the Quebec bar said that it would not allow Parliament to do that to our society.  \lineBreak Will the government stop wasting billions of dollars on an approach that is bound to fail and that will only lead to more crime, less justice and skyrocketing costs?","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian public gave us a mandate to protect them against violent young offenders. That is something new. All the measures in this legislation that aims to protect Canadians will respect the rights of young offenders and of Quebeckers, and will also protect Canadian society against dangerous reoffenders. That is what we were asked to do and that is what we will do. We are asking for the support of the opposition."
1102,"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to veterans, Conservatives were asleep at the switch yesterday. The Conservatives are slashing funding for Veterans Affairs just as a new influx of Afghanistan veterans needs our support in dealing with debilitating injuries, including post-traumatic stress. Our brave vets have earned the support of Canadians, and we are behind our veterans. Liberals have forced the Veterans Affairs committee to get behind our veterans.  \lineBreak What is it going to take to finally get the Conservatives behind our veterans and stop these cuts?","Mr. Speaker, no government has been as strong in stepping up for our military, and in particular our veterans, as this Conservative government. \lineBreak After years of neglect by our predecessors in the Liberal government, we have made sure that veterans are getting their due; that includes, of course, enhanced benefits that they will continue to get into the future. \lineBreak We have enhanced those benefits to make up for the deficiencies of the past, improving access to monthly benefits for seriously injured veterans to up to $1,600 per month for life. We have introduced a monthly $1,000 supplement for most seriously injured or ill veterans. We have done numerous other things for our veterans. We will always be there for our veterans."
1103,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government is slashing ACOA. Its budget has been cut by almost 40% from 2005 levels, which is stunning, given that the  \lineBreak Would the minister table a list of all ACOA cuts and, along with that list, a list of individuals hired by ACOA since the Conservatives came into power?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave us a clear mandate to keep taxes low and balance our budget by 2014-15. ACOA has identified ways to make its internal services more efficient--for example, by reducing costs associated with travel and internal operations.  \lineBreak Over the next year, we will continue to cut the fat out of government. We will review all spending. We will review all hiring. \lineBreak This government has done more for ACOA than the previous government, and we continue to support it."
1104,"Mr. Speaker, all members of the House share the grief and pain of the Turkish people following Sunday's earthquake. \lineBreak Can the government provide an update on the situation, on the assistance that is available to Canadian citizens in Turkey, and on how Canada can help if asked to do so by the Turkish government? \lineBreak Can the government give us an update on Canada's response following the earthquake in Turkey?","Mr. Speaker, like all Canadians, this government shares concern with the events in Turkey and the recent earthquake. As members know, the Canadian government has at its disposal certain assets and resources that can be deployed to assist if we receive a request. As of this point in time, we have not yet received a request from the Turkish government for such assistance, but we are fortunate that we are in a position to be able to respond if necessary."
1105,"Mr. Speaker, workers and their families, particularly those from Quebec City's south shore, are in limbo. The Davie shipbuilding company, one of the Quebec City region's economic drivers, still does not have an answer about its future. \lineBreak Since the main contracts were announced last week, when does the minister intend to begin the bidding process for the remaining $2 billion?","Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, the national shipbuilding strategy will benefit all regions of Canada, including Quebec. \lineBreak As far as Davie shipyards are concerned, as the member knows, there are over 116 smaller ships that have yet to be tendered. Davie is welcome to compete for those contracts."
1106,"Mr. Speaker, all we want to know is whether the government is going to speed up the bidding process for these contracts. This government needs to give Quebec families some answers. Can Davie, like other shipbuilding companies, expect to receive contracts? Canada's shipyards need stability in order to ensure their growth. That is the very premise of the national procurement strategy. \lineBreak Can this government tell us its plan for supporting the shipyards that have not been awarded any contracts?","Mr. Speaker, one of the important parts of the strategy is dealing with the boom and bust aspect of the shipbuilding and marine industry to which the member is referring. Of course having this long-term strategy does that, because apart from the two large packages that were awarded last week, as I said, there are contracts for 116 smaller ships, as well as $500 million to $600 million of maintenance work ongoing. Any shipyards outside of the two that won are welcome to bid on those."
1107,"Mr. Speaker, $2 billion in shipbuilding contracts have yet to be awarded. The Davie shipyard is in the process of restarting operations. Thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the Quebec City area are at stake, and other shipyards in the country are in the same situation. Last week, the member for  \lineBreak My question is simple: when will this government start the bidding process for granting the $2 billion? ","Mr. Speaker, as I said, this is a national strategy that helps regions in all parts of the country. \lineBreak There are expected to be 15,000 jobs created. That is just in direct jobs. We should look at the indirect opportunities for the manufacturing sector and shipyards across the country. The member has to remember that it is not just Davie, there are shipyards in every region of this country that will benefit from this strategy."
1108,"Mr. Speaker, when the government kills the Canadian Wheat Board single desk, it could also kill Canada's brand in global grain markets. \lineBreak Private companies will no doubt try to gather up the Wheat Board's $6 billion in annual sales to enhance shareholder value for their owners, not for farmers. Then major foreign grain corporations are likely to come calling with takeover bids. \lineBreak Why does the government think farmers are better off with all key decisions about Canadian grain being made in Minneapolis, Chicago or Kansas City?","Mr. Speaker, the one thing I can guarantee to the member for  \lineBreak What we are doing is moving ahead with marketing freedom for western Canadian farmers. They will now have the ability to choose whom they market through. They are the ones, the stewards of the land, who guarantee the quality and consistency of supply. They will continue to do that. The line companies, whether they are an American, British or European multinational or a Canadian multinational like Viterra, which is global in scope, will continue to market that top-quality grain produced by our farmers."
1109,"Mr. Speaker, a year ago the government was forced to reverse itself on potash. The government was originally in favour of selling off the industry, but flipped. \lineBreak In the wake of that confusion, the government promised a new set of takeover rules, greater clarity on net benefit, more transparency, enforceable conditions, a precise definition of strategic asset, but nothing has been produced so far. \lineBreak If a big U.S. grain corporation decides to go after, say, Viterra, does the government plan to declare the Canadian grain business a strategic asset?","Mr. Speaker, the Canadian farming sector across the board is a tremendous Canadian asset. We have seen growth in canola, in special crops— \lineBreak

1110,"Order, please. There is far too much conversation going on during the answers to the questions being posed. Let us let the minister answer the question.","Mr. Speaker, if the member for  \lineBreak We know the great work that Canadian farmers do. We know it is global in scope. We know that our processors can step up and produce as well using that quality as a basis. We will continue to support Canadian farmers, in spite of those Liberals."
1111,"Mr. Speaker, many experts have warned that tax-free savings accounts will not help poor seniors who have little income to save. The wealthy seniors can salt away hundreds of thousands in TFSAs and still receive the guaranteed income supplement. \lineBreak New Democrats proposed a better plan to increase the GIS and raise every senior out of poverty, but those Conservatives refused. They ignored those in need and instead chose another subsidy for their friends. \lineBreak When will they ever get their priorities straight?","Mr. Speaker, I know the NDP does not like lower taxes, does not like the tax-free savings account, voted against the tax-free savings account and voted against lower taxes. However, Canadians like the tax-free savings account, and I will tell members how much they like it. There were 6.7 million tax-free savings accounts in Canada as of the end of December. That is a lot of rich friends."
1112,"Mr. Speaker, a tax expert has confirmed that under the current rules, a senior could have up to $1 million in a TFSA and still be entitled to the guaranteed income supplement, a pension that is meant for seniors living below the poverty line. \lineBreak Instead of helping seniors in need, TFSAs will redirect $4 billion to the richest seniors. \lineBreak Is that really the government's solution to helping less fortunate seniors live in dignity?","Mr. Speaker, I encourage the member opposite to have a look at the law with respect to the tax-free savings account and also the facts. In the tax-free savings account legislation, which her party voted against, we ensured protection for modest-and low-income Canadians. That was to ensure they could afford the tax-free savings account. As I say, 6.7 million accounts were opened, three-quarters of them by individuals in the two lowest tax brackets."
1113,"Mr. Speaker, while the  \lineBreak Could the ","We are representing Canada proudly, Mr. Speaker, by leading by example, including the strongest financial system in the world, the lowest debt to GDP ratio in the G7, the best job growth in the G7, the best place to invest in the G7. We are leading with the next phase of Canada's economic action plan and lowering taxes to create jobs. We are leading with a prudent plan to return to balanced budgets and surpluses. Now it is time for European leaders to act quickly with strong, decisive and united leadership."
1114,"Mr. Speaker, New Democrats are proud to stand with the people of Libya and people across the entire Arab region as they demand rights that Canadians hold to be universal. Canada has a key role to play in fostering democratic development.  \lineBreak In 2008 Conservatives promised to create a democratic development institute. Why has the government broken this promise just when the centre is needed most of all?","Mr. Speaker, the key element of the foreign policy of this government is promotion of democracy. That is what we are doing in Libya. The  \lineBreak  With Mr. Gadhafi gone, we are looking at helping Libya set up a constitution and move forward with the promotion of democracy. That remains the key element of foreign policy for this government."
1115,"Mr. Speaker, Canada has proudly supported Libyans in their efforts to end the tyranny of the Gadhafi regime. Support for disarmament and reconstruction is essential, but we have the skills, resources and expertise to do much more. Protecting human rights is a key goal of the UN support mission in Libya and an essential part of the transition to democracy. \lineBreak Is the government prepared to work with the UN and offer its support for the independent monitoring of human rights in Libya?","Mr. Speaker, I really do not know where the NDP lives. The "
1116,"Mr. Speaker, last week Libyans cast off more than 40 years of autocratic rule, and much of the success is owed to the women of Libya. \lineBreak  In keeping with this legacy of nation-building and at a recent international conference, Libyan women declared that they wanted to be talked to, not about. \lineBreak In light of the recent debates about Sharia law and the rights of women, can we count on the government to support the desire of Libyan women to be part of the National Transitional Council and any future Libyan governments in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1325?","Mr. Speaker, let me make it very clear. As I said before, human rights is the cornerstone of this government's policy, including rights for women. We made that very clear when the  \lineBreak I can assure the member that we will stand up for those rights when we talk to the NTC as it moves ahead post-Gadhafi in building up its new constitution."
1117,"Mr. Speaker, the Muskoka minister said:  \lineBreak However, the minister managed applications from his constituency office. He evaded the AG and evaded access to information laws. \lineBreak Will he stand now and take responsibility, or is he too busy looking for the address of the Huntsville police department?","Mr. Speaker, the facts still have not changed. The Auditor General's appearance at committee confirmed that the issue has been totally aired. We have said that we have accepted the Auditor General's recommendation, so I do not know what the problem is.  \lineBreak I will join the "
1118,"Mr. Speaker, the spokespeople may change, but the broken record sounds the same. \lineBreak We know that the minister was involved in 32 projects, that he implemented a parallel process that was hidden from the Auditor General and administered from his constituency office, and that he did not submit a single document to the Auditor General even though senior federal officials were at the meetings. After being promised transparency and openness, Canadians are disappointed and for good reason. \lineBreak When we will have a complete parliamentary investigation to shed some light on all the abuses of ethical and financial trust involved in the G8 funding?","Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member. It is the same old story. The facts have not changed. How many times do I have to tell him that the facts have not changed?  \lineBreak The Auditor General has aired this issue thoroughly. What else can I say? She came in front of the committee and said this very clearly. If he were a member of the committee, he would have known what the Auditor General said. I will repeat again that the facts have not changed. The answers will remain the same."
1119,"Mr. Speaker, the situation in Egypt continues to deteriorate for Coptic Christians. Copts, who make up 10% to 15% of the population in Egypt, are being targeted and persecuted for ethnic and religious reasons by hateful enemies. Countless murders of Copts have been reported in Cairo and across Egypt, and many others are going unreported. \lineBreak My question is for the minister. What is our government doing to address this unprecedented violence toward the largest religious minority in the region?","Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the  \lineBreak The  \lineBreak We will always stand in solidarity with those who face this kind of persecution."
1120,"Mr. Speaker, it has been five full months since the terrible flooding in Manitoba and the evacuation of the first nations. The community of Lake St. Martin First Nation is still devastated. There were 727 citizens evacuated, most still occupying rooms spread across six hotels in downtown Winnipeg at a cost of $1 million per week. Children are not in permanent schools and families have no hope in sight. \lineBreak Will the minister commit today to rebuild Lake St. Martin First Nation on the higher ground that is right next to that community?","Mr. Speaker, yes, Lake St. Martin is a very tragic story and we know that the community has been relocated. The children are now getting their schooling and we are working with the Province of Manitoba. I sent a special representative to look into the situation. We will be working with the province and looking at a relocation of the community."
1121,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are again planning to dismantle the Avro Arrow, this time in Downsview, Ontario, and literally cutting it apart with torches, just like in 1959. \lineBreak The Air and Space Museum has been evicted and is on a growing list of our heritage buildings facing the Conservative government's wrecking ball. \lineBreak Last week, Rob Cohen, the CEO of the museum, said, “It is all pass the buck politics”. When will the Conservatives stop passing the buck and step in to save this historic museum?"," Mr. Speaker, first, even though it is called the Canadian Air and Space Museum, it is, in fact, a private museum and a private collection. The museum had a fundraising campaign, but it was not as successful as it had hoped it would be. This was a decision by Downsview.  \lineBreak The museum has not been paying its bills and it has not been paying the taxes, I understand. This was a responsible decision made by Downsview and by the Department of Public Works. \lineBreak I have asked my department to work with our national museums and to ask the management of that museum what in their collection they would like to save, and to work with the government to make some of the collection available to some of our national museums. \lineBreak We are showing leadership, both to the museum and to the collection, but also to taxpayers."

I appeared before the committee last week. I look forward to the Senate committee reporting back with the facts. I would be happy to share those facts with the hon. member."
1124,"Mr. Speaker, my question today for the  \lineBreak They are looking for a national public safety officer compensation benefit, for access to vaccines and anti-virals in the case of a flu pandemic and for changes to national building codes to make it safer for them when they do their job. \lineBreak Will government members commit that we can get this done for our firefighters?","Mr. Speaker, we work very closely with the firefighters on a number of issues and we continue to look forward to working with them. \lineBreak I might point out the specific example that our government brought in with respect to hazardous materials and the moneys we paid in that respect to help train the trainers. We also brought forward the tax credit for volunteer firefighters, which the opposition parties voted against, which was very unfortunate."
1125,"Mr. Speaker, the government is about to undermine public safety by getting rid of the gun registry. While the government is rushing to turn its back on its responsibility to protect the safety of Canadians, some provinces seem ready to take on that responsibility. \lineBreak Will the government help provinces, such as Quebec, that might try to create their own gun control system? Will the government give them the data already in the registry? Second, will the government allow police across the country to continue consulting the data already in the registry?","Mr. Speaker, we have consistently opposed this wasteful, ineffective measure that does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Our government has strongly and consistently opposed the prior Liberal government's $2 billion boondoggle. \lineBreak Provincial governments are free to proceed as they wish, but we will not assist in setting up another registry. Records held by the Canadian firearms program will not be shared with the provinces."
1126,"Mr. Speaker, the government is gutting science from DFO. This comes at a time when a dreaded virus has been found in B.C. salmon stocks, a virus which wiped out 70% of farmed stocks in Chile. Science is needed more than ever to ensure the health and conservation of our fish stocks. \lineBreak Why does the government insist on putting Canada's fish stocks and our growing aquaculture industry at even greater risk by slashing science from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans?","Mr. Speaker, nothing is further from the truth. The DFO and this government have made huge investments in science over the course of the last number of years, since 2006, some $30 million, as an example, including upgrades to 13 laboratories in sites across the country and $36 million to construct those new science vessels. \lineBreak In terms of the ISA, the ISA issue on the west coast is concerning. However, at this time, there have been no reported findings that at all make this finding conclusive."
1127,"Mr. Speaker, the Bank of Canada today confirmed what the TD Bank, Scotiabank, BMO, the International Monetary Fund and others have said: that economic growth is slowing to a crawl both globally and here in Canada, where it is down 25%, and the risk is rising that things could get worse. Canadian jobs are obviously in jeopardy. \lineBreak Why has the government increased the burden of EI payroll taxes this year by $600 million? Why is it adding another $1.2 billion in further job-killing payroll taxes next year?","Mr. Speaker, that is a surprising question coming from a party that has voted against every single tax reduction the government has brought into effect and in fact continues to oppose measures that are before the House at this time. \lineBreak Obviously, the fact that we are in a fragile global recovery and that we are anticipating slow growth comes as no surprise to anyone on this side of the House. I welcome the Liberal Party to that realization. I encourage its members to do as we are doing, to focus on jobs and growth, and pass the important tax reduction measures that are before the House of Commons."
1128,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians were appalled yesterday to see a troubling video posted on the website of the  \lineBreak In the video a cartoon Wheat Board executive tells a farmer, “Slow down,  young man. You are talking Eskimo....You cannot do those things in Saskatchewan”. The slur is used not once,  but three times.  \lineBreak Will the parliamentary secretary please apologize to all Canadians for this slur?","Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that the offending video has been removed. I know the member for "

If he has nothing to fear, why does he not do it?","Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what members on this side of the House do every weekend. We go home and talk to our friends, our families and our neighbours down the road, who are actually farming. That is what we do for fun on the weekends, and, without exception, they continue to tell us to get this job done, to make sure they have marketing freedom, to make sure there is certainty and clarity in the marketplace starting the first of this year. That is what they want for a New Year's resolution."
1130,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Would the minister surprise us and not disappoint us by standing up for Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, what is not surprising is that the member continues not to stand up for Canadians.  \lineBreak While that member has been grandstanding in the House, we have been raising this issue with the Americans for some time. As the member should know, the U.S. is sovereign and has a right to impose this tax. However, we have made it very clear that now is not the time to erect new trade barriers. We continue to impress upon the American government that new trade barriers hurt both Canadian and American businesses as well as travellers and workers."
1131,"Mr. Speaker, a new study from SFU confirms the evidence coming out of Texas that the Conservative government's misguided punishment policies just will not work. They discriminate heavily against first nations, who already account for a disproportionate percentage of prisoners. The evidence predicts increased prison overcrowding, reduced access to treatment and a higher likelihood of prisoners reoffending.  \lineBreak Expensive, ineffective and discriminatory: that is Bill  \lineBreak Is the government against evidence, or is it against real solutions for Canada's aboriginal peoples?","Mr. Speaker, our very first priority when it comes to public safety is that of keeping our communities and streets safe for all Canadians. \lineBreak We have made unprecedented investments in ensuring that those who are in those facilities receive treatment so that they can come out rehabilitated, because that also makes our communities safer. However, we make no apologies for ensuring that we proceed with a program that ensures we keep criminals where they belong until such time as they are safe to return to the community.  \lineBreak We want to keep our communities safe. I am not surprised that the opposition does not share that view."
1132,"The government, Mr. Speaker, is ashamed of Canada's history, ashamed of the cherished public broadcaster that has served this country for 75 years. Conservatives have criticized the CBC, bullied it in committee and even cheated Canadians out of celebrating this important milestone. For three-quarters of a century, the CBC has shaped our memories and marked our history, yet Conservatives treat it like an embarrassment. \lineBreak Can the minister tell us why he denied Canadians their chance to celebrate their CBC?","Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague is talking about my speech on Canada Day last year, which I wrote myself. Instead of celebrating the CBC, which the member is free to do as he wants, what I chose to say instead in my speech was, “On this Canada Day...to those men and women of the Canadian Forces serving in Afghanistan, in Libya, and other difficult places in the world: to put it simply, you are the bravest and the best, we are proud of your service, and we are honoured by the work that you do for Canada”.  \lineBreak That is what I said instead of praising the CBC. I had two minutes, and I stand by my decision."
1133,"Mr. Speaker, we would be hard pressed to find a Canadian who did not grow up with at least one favourite CBC show. I am sure that even the minister had his own favourite show. The CBC is one of the best public broadcasters in the world and it has been offering quality programming for 75 years. Canadians are very proud of the CBC. It is an important Canadian institution. \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives refuse to celebrate it?","Mr. Speaker, as part of its 75th anniversary programming this year, the CBC aired an excellent show on Sir John A. Macdonald. It was very good. \lineBreak The CBC can celebrate its 75th anniversary. What we would like, as a government elected based on a platform, is a balanced budget and responsible spending and savings. We are therefore asking the CBC to spend taxpayers' money responsibly and respectfully. That is our program and our promise to Canadians. We will keep our promises."
1134,"Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago the former Liberal government introduced a long gun registry. This policy, which was supposed to cost no more than a few million dollars, ballooned to well over $2 billion of taxpayers' money. On top of the ridiculously inflated cost, this measure does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and needlessly targets law-abiding hunters, farmers and sports shooters. Conservatives have long promised to end this wasteful and ineffective measure.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this morning our government tabled a bill to end the long gun registry.  \lineBreak Our Conservative government does not support treating law-abiding outdoors enthusiasts and farmers as if they were criminals. We have consistently opposed the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry, which does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Canadians gave our government a strong mandate in places like Sault Ste. Marie and Nipissing to once and for all end this long gun registry. We are doing what we said we would do."

I will certainly check after question period. If it has not, it will be coming down."
1138,"Mr. Speaker, Kinder Morgan is set to double the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline that runs from Edmonton to Burnaby. Residents and local municipalities are concerned about what this project could mean for the local environment, especially in the wake of the 2007 oil spill that forced the evacuation of hundreds of Burnaby residents and leaked oil into Burrard Inlet. \lineBreak Will the minister agree to full public consultation on this project, including direct talks with affected municipalities and first nations?","Mr. Speaker, every major project is reviewed by a regulatory agency. Our government respects the regulatory process, and that will proceed in every case."
1139,"Mr. Speaker, for months now, people in my riding have been seeing leaks in the pipeline that crosses Brome—Missisquoi. This pipeline is close to a waterway, the Missisquoi River. In an inspection report dated May 20, engineers from the National Energy Board raised doubts about the company's ability to detect and stop the leaks, even though the company is responsible for them. \lineBreak What does the government intend to do to reassure the residents about the safety of the pipeline?","Mr. Speaker, the National Energy Board is a strong, independent regulatory body. Its mandate is to ensure the safety and security of pipelines, from the moment they are proposed until they are abandoned."
1140,"Mr. Speaker, last week our government introduced the historic marketing freedom for grain farmers act in the House.

1141,"Mr. Speaker, although all Canadians are feeling the adverse effects of economic uncertainty, students are also being hit hard by the high rate of unemployment and an average student debt in excess of $25,000 and rising. Using the excuse that the Conservatives are doing better than the previous government is insulting. The reality is they are not doing enough. \lineBreak When will this government truly help the next generation, which is being crushed by debt? ","Mr. Speaker, let us look at the balance sheet as to who has done what.  \lineBreak Our government brought in the Canada summer student grants program to help students access post-secondary education at a lower cost and without debt. We overhauled the Canada student loan program to streamline it, to make more students qualify and to help them repay it earlier. \lineBreak We also increased the numbers of jobs available to students, so they could help finance their own way through university. \lineBreak That is our record. What is the record of the NDP members? They voted against every single one of those ways to help students. Shame on them."
1142,"Mr. Speaker, according to the  \lineBreak For months now, we keep hearing the Conservatives say that their priority is the economy, yet now they are making cuts to an agency that promotes the economy. \lineBreak Can the minister tell us what he would call responsible cuts within the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency?","Mr. Speaker, I am surprised, because I thought the NDP member from Atlantic Canada was going to rise to congratulate the government on its shipbuilding strategy, which will create thousands of jobs across the country. \lineBreak This surprises me, but I want to reassure the member that the jobs that will be eliminated at the agency will not affect services to businesses and communities in Atlantic Canada, and that is what matters. Only the employees' union is complaining, while businesspeople and job creators continue to applaud us."
1143,"Mr. Speaker, in addition to opposing the Bloc Québécois's bill on the application of Bill 101 to companies under federal jurisdiction, the government, with the help of the NDP, appointed a unilingual anglophone judge to the Supreme Court. Now, the government is at it again with the appointment of an auditor general who does not speak French. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, as always, our government makes appointments based on merit, and the top priority is to provide Canadians with the best service."
1144,"Mr. Speaker, certain provinces, like Quebec, have expressed concern about plans to abolish the gun registry and are considering creating their own registries. Now the government wants to throw out the baby with the bathwater and destroy all of the valuable information that has been duly collected and is ever so useful to police forces.  \lineBreak Will the government put an end to its completely irrational behaviour and hand over the valuable information from the Canadian registry, if the provinces ask for it?","Mr. Speaker, the answer is no. Our government refuses to treat law-abiding hunters, farmers and sport shooters like criminals. The provincial governments are free to act in their areas of jurisdiction, but we will not help them create another registry by the back door. The information in our possession will be destroyed and the registry will be abolished once and for all."
1145,"Mr. Speaker, a tax credit of $160 million does not fix a tax increase of $1.8 billion. \lineBreak Among the Canadians getting clobbered on the stock market are those with RRSPs withering away. At age 71, they have no choice and must convert their RRSPs into registered income funds and begin reporting them as taxable. \lineBreak Given the stock market turmoil, will the government show flexibility for seniors, flexibility on the date when RRSPs must be converted to RRIFs and flexibility on the minimum amounts to be taken into income?","Mr. Speaker, once again that is a surprising question from a party that has consistently opposed the tax measures that the government has brought in for Canadian seniors, including those as important as the tax-free savings account, income splitting for senior citizens and increases to the guaranteed income supplement. \lineBreak I would encourage the members of the Liberal Party to support the measures that are before the House and actually support Canadian seniors rather than coming up with excuses as to why they constantly vote against good things for our Canadian seniors."
1146,"Mr. Speaker, information obtained by the NDP reveals just how out of touch the Conservative government is with families in need. Almost 25% of people who call Service Canada about their EI hang up because they cannot reach anyone. Half of all seniors who call for help do not even get an automated message. Now, Conservatives want to take an axe to Service Canada. \lineBreak As the economy slows down, why is the government cutting services that struggling families rely on?","Mr. Speaker, in fact, we are doing just the opposite. While our priority is to ensure we create jobs and growth in the economy, for those who do need to access EI, we are modernizing the service. We are automating the service so Canadians can get better service, so they can get it faster, and so it is more affordable. We are working on that and we are making good progress so we can help Canadians."
1147,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians who have lost their jobs and who so desperately need help are losing hope. Almost 25% of people who call Service Canada about their EI hang up because they cannot reach anyone to get answers to their questions. That is unacceptable. Imagine the problems that there will be when EI processing centres close. \lineBreak Families who have lost their jobs deserve better. Why is the Conservative government abandoning families when they need help?","Mr. Speaker, we want to help those who need access to EI. We are modernizing and automating the system so that Canadians can get better service, so they can get it faster and so it is more affordable."
1148,"Mr. Speaker, seniors who built this country are being left out in the cold by the government. Half of all CPP-related calls to Service Canada are completely ignored. There is no one to help, not even an automated message. Seniors are looking to their government for the help they deserve, but all they find is a dead phone line.  \lineBreak Why are Conservatives proposing more cuts after they have already failed to provide even basic services to seniors?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has her facts wrong. We are consolidating and improving the service for seniors and indeed for all Canadians. We are working right now, and have been working for some time, with some very old, outdated systems, very cumbersome paper systems. \lineBreak That is why we are automating systems, to make the service faster, more effective and more efficient, so we can indeed help seniors and all Canadians get access to the services and benefits to which they are entitled."
1149,"Mr. Speaker, the facts are simply not in line with the government's answer. The Conservatives are going to cut services that are already broken. They refuse to lift seniors out of poverty, and now Service Canada will not even answer the phone. Our seniors deserve better from their government. Canadians are just learning about those service reduction problems, but the Conservatives have known about it all along.  \lineBreak Will the government cancel the cuts to Service Canada, or just keep ignoring our seniors' calls for help? The phones are ringing.","Mr. Speaker, as I explained, we are consolidating the processing of employment insurance. That will have absolutely no impact on services to seniors such, as CPP and old age security. Why are we doing this? Because we are dealing with an antiquated paper system that needs to be replaced and automated so we can provide services faster, more accurately and more affordably. \lineBreak As for Service Canada, we are keeping all of our front-line personnel in place, so Canadians can get access to the services they need."
1150,"Mr. Speaker, if this is the government's response, perhaps the government does not understand what people are going through. \lineBreak In September, nearly one in four Canadians was unable to reach anyone at Service Canada about their EI. Half of all seniors calling about CPP and old age security had to hang up because they could not reach anyone. Meanwhile, the government continues to make cuts at Service Canada. \lineBreak Do the Conservatives consider these cuts to services acceptable when more and more people are unable to get through and have to hang up?","Mr. Speaker, we are improving the services that Service Canada provides to Canadians, including access to the guaranteed income supplement and pensions. We have improved services for seniors. Unfortunately, the NDP voted against these improvements."
1151,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are saying that they are doing better than previous governments, but this is not the sort of attitude that really helps people. \lineBreak Canadians are still not getting any answers from Service Canada and they are getting even fewer answers from the Conservatives in the House of Commons. The Conservatives are telling Service Canada and its employees to do more with less. However, statistics show that the services currently being provided are already inadequate. \lineBreak When will this government understand that overburdening Service Canada workers will not result in better service to the Canadian public? It is a simple question, and the answer should be simple as well. What impact will the new cuts to services have on the public?","Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to taxpayers: to put their money to good use. That means that Service Canada must operate effectively. That is why we are improving and modernizing our systems so that they are more effective, efficient and affordable. This will allow us to provide better service to Canadians."
1152,"Mr. Speaker, as RCMP contract talks resume this week, Conservatives continue to bring more threats than ideas to the negotiating table. The province and municipalities have said they are ready to negotiate in good faith in order to keep B.C. families safe. They are asking the government to be serious and constructive. \lineBreak When will the minister stop using the public safety of British Columbians as a bargaining chip?","Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the solicitor general of British Columbia forwarded some of her concerns that she indicated that she would provide to me in September. I understand officials are sitting down and working together with British Columbia officials. \lineBreak  I understand, at the same time, that some of the municipalities that are looking at moving from municipal police forces to the RCMP would like this settled. I would urge the British Columbia government to look at the proposals that we have on the table. We will look at what it presented and come to a fair conclusion."
1153,"Mr. Speaker, with weeks left it shows how out of touch Conservatives are with reality. Conservatives are asking British Columbians to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to the federal government for rejecting its unfair HST and now Conservatives are threatening to pull the police off our streets. \lineBreak The province and municipalities are ready and willing to talk, so when will the government stop playing games with our public safety and start listening to British Columbians?","Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member did not hear the answer. Officials are sitting down to look over the proposals that the solicitor general from British Columbia finally forwarded to the federal officials. I thank her for sending those proposals to us. I would urge the officials to work out the bugs that remain in this contract and get to ensuring that we have an appropriate RCMP contract in place."
1154,"Mr. Speaker, the government is constantly bragging about its law and order agenda, but it is threatening to pull the RCMP off British Columbia streets if it does not agree to a new labour contract by the end of November. Fortunately, negotiations will resume this week. \lineBreak British Columbia families are wondering whether the Conservatives will start working in their best interests and in the interests of their safety, or if the Conservatives will continue to threaten to pull police officers off the streets. \lineBreak British Columbia is prepared to negotiate in good faith. Are the Conservatives prepared to do the same?","Mr. Speaker, I provided the answer and I do not know if the individual heard me. I would like to quote the Canadian Police Association, which members opposite should take to heart. It said: \lineBreak We would ask the NDP members to get off of their high horse and actually do things that make a difference to front line police officers and the citizens they serve."
1155,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that cuts to the public service could prevent qualified young workers from getting good quality jobs. Furthermore, the government's newly lowered growth projections do not predict anything good for our young workers. \lineBreak We have an unacceptable unemployment rate of over 14%. What is the minister doing to stop wasting the talent of our young people?","Mr. Speaker, both the IMF and the OECD anticipate that Canada will have the strongest economic growth in the G7. We have the best job creation record in the G7, 650,000 jobs since the end of the recession in July 2009.  \lineBreak We have the strongest banking system in the world, the strongest fiscal system in the world, and the best net debt to GDP ratio in the G7. As I said, we are on track for modest growth this year and next."
1156,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives love to present misleading job creation numbers. The truth is that we have lost 220,000 jobs for young people since the recession began. Unemployment is up, economic indicators are down and, according to the Bank of Canada, our economy is slowing to a crawl. Conservatives want Canadians to believe that corporate tax giveaways to profitable companies are the answer. They are  not.  \lineBreak When will the minister have something more than empty talking points to offer jobless Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I invite the member opposite to tell the 650,000 Canadians who are working now as result of the economic action plan that their jobs do not matter to them and that the government's policy has not mattered to them. \lineBreak This is the policy that the NDP voted against. This is the job creation policy that NDP members talk about, but every time we bring a measure to the House, they vote against the measure, depriving Canadians of jobs. Now they have the nerve to suggest job creation programs."
1157,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak  The minister is the only who can put military families and their communities at ease. Will he please stand in his place and assure military base communities that they have nothing to fear?","Mr. Speaker, methinks he doth protest too much. When it comes to fearmongering, he is referring to a report that was late. The October 2011 departmental directive, which he is referring to, does not speak of base closures. What it does reference in an accompanying news article is a Liberal senator musing about base closures.  \lineBreak The only person who is causing alarm in the military community, their families and the country, and misleading Canadians about base closures, is the member opposite."
1158,"Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of the directive to which the minister refers. It says: \lineBreak Again, does this mean base closures, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, that is sound and fury signifying nothing. Let me be clear about what the NDP members are up to, and we have seen this before. It is an old opposition tactic: create a crisis, panic people, put fearmongering out there among military families, and then, when it does not happen, claim credit. That is what they are up to. \lineBreak  The member opposite is simply trying to create a crisis that does not exist. The NDP does not support the military, it does not support the investments and that is unfortunate."
1159,"Mr. Speaker, we know that the hon. member for  \lineBreak Does the government continue to believe that no new facts have surfaced and that the ministers involved in the G8 scandal did nothing wrong?","Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the former infrastructure minister made these decisions. Each dollar has been accounted for. Not a penny is missing, as Mr. Wiersama, the former Auditor General, has said. He said that he knows what they got for that money. Thirty-two projects were funded and the government announced each one. They can be found on the department's website."
1160,"Mr. Speaker, we are among friends. We can tell it like it is. Wasting $50 million of taxpayers' money, using government coffers for personal political spending—it all smacks of a great political, financial and ethical scandal. \lineBreak The Conservatives are saying that they want to implement the Auditor General's recommendations. If one of these recommendations were to have Parliament get to the bottom of this, would the government agree to submit to a full royal commission on the G8 scandal?","Mr. Speaker, there already has been an inquiry into it. There has been an exhaustive review by the interim Auditor General. \lineBreak If I could quote a truly great Canadian, “the facts have not changed”. Everyone could take a moment now to recognize that truly great Canadian, the hon. member for "
1161,"Mr. Speaker, 139 days and the Muskoka member is still hiding behind the backbenchers and not explaining why he hid the paper trail in his office. \lineBreak The Auditor General said that he broke the rules and called on Parliament to investigate. That was before we learned about all the other cabinet ministers who were taking his lead and going to the pork buffet as well. \lineBreak How many other ministers circumvented the rules, took this man's lead and used the taxpayers' Treasury Board as their own personal cash machine?","Mr. Speaker, I clearly could not say this with the same level of eloquence as my colleague for  \lineBreak  The reality also is that the member across the way has promised his constituents time and time again to support the elimination of the long gun registry. Will he honour his word, do the right thing and vote for our bill to do just that?"
1162,"Mr. Speaker, if the big game hunter on the backbenches is going to take down this scandal, he is going to have to put a little more ammunition in his pop gun. \lineBreak The facts are that since the Muskoka minister has to hide behind members like him to answer, I will do him a favour and I will speak for the Muskoka minister. He said “If set up a parallel process where the Auditor General did not know, I would be resigning right now and turning myself in to the local police”.  \lineBreak The question for my good friends on the Conservative backbenches is this. Will someone volunteer, do the right thing, help this verbally challenged minister, put up a hand and call 1-800-Huntsville PD.","Mr. Speaker, the member continues to ask the same question, so he will continue to get the same answer. \lineBreak The reality is that the former minister of infrastructure made this decision. He has taken responsibility for it. The reason we know what these projects are is because they are all published on the Infrastructure Canada website. There are 32 of them. We know where the funds went. We know that it came in under budget. We know every dollar went toward building the projects that have been published."
1163,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the chair of the veterans affairs committee. Tomorrow he has scheduled a secret meeting, but we are supposed to be hearing from witnesses in public. Liberals submitted a list of witnesses concerned about the cuts, people and organizations like the ombudsman, the Royal Canadian Legion and many others. \lineBreak Why is the Conservative chair holding secret meetings? Are the Conservatives plotting to cancel public hearings?","Mr. Speaker, had the member listened—"
1164,"Order, please. The hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs.","Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I was interrupted by the red kindergarten. \lineBreak Had the member been attentive at the last committee meeting, he would have clearly understood that we are maintaining and investing in our veterans. We are doing that with skilled professionals who are working in our department, in Charlottetown, in our regional office, and with the full support of this government because we support our veterans."
1165,"Mr. Speaker, I have a quote of the member for  \lineBreak If the member for ","Mr. Speaker, I have a tremendous quote here, too. Let me put this on the record. It states, “when the government is intending to change the legislation, I honestly don't see the grounds for going to court. The government has the right to change the legislation. I don't see the case for taking it to court”. \lineBreak That was said by the member for "
1166,"Mr. Speaker, the government's proposed dismantling of the Wheat Board is already having a negative impact on Churchill. Things are already being cleared out of the port. People are being told that shipments will not be coming through. They are worried about losing their jobs and having to uproot their families. \lineBreak Why is the government creating chaos and uncertainty in communities like Churchill and communities across the Prairies? When will it put aside the interests of big agra and stand up for western Canadians and their communities?","What we are trying to do on the government side, Mr. Speaker, is bring clarity and certainty to the grain industry in western Canada. What is not helpful is when the chair of the Wheat Board, Allen Oberg, and his seven friends from across western Canada bring uncertainty to this role. That is the problem that we are having with Churchill. Those guys are implementing a scorched earth policy, trying to prove the inevitable by simply being intransigent to this change that we are trying to bring. \lineBreak Freedom to western Canadian farmers is priceless."
1167,"Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that the number of homicides committed with long guns has decreased, the Conservatives have decided to turn a deaf ear with regard to the firearms registry. They are turning their backs on women, victims, the police, the victims' ombudsman and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. They are even going to destroy the data in their ideological blindness.  \lineBreak Why destroy $2 billion in accumulated information when the provinces and the police want to keep it?","Mr. Speaker, it is true that we are getting rid of the ineffective and useless long gun registry. I agree with a number of experts on that.  \lineBreak Let me quote someone who said, “I have always believed that the gun registry is a failure in principle and a failure in policy, and that we could have done much better with different policies.” Who said that? It was the member for  \lineBreak Another member said, “My intention is to see the wasteful long gun registry ended.” Who said that? It was the NDP member from Thunder Bay. \lineBreak Another member said, “I've always opposed the long gun registry because I thought it was unfair to law-abiding firearms owners.” Who said that? It was the NDP member for "
1168,"Mr. Speaker, new information released today by Statistics Canada shows that homicides in Canada are at a 45-year low. The main factor is fewer deaths caused by rifles. Yet, on this very day, the Conservative government wants not only to turn its back on police, but also to burn all the data that helps keep the homicide rate in Canada low.  \lineBreak Why is the government putting a divisive ideology ahead of our communities' safety?","Mr. Speaker, the registry has done nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. In order to protect the privacy of law-abiding long gun owners, records held by the Canadian firearms program on currently registered long guns will be destroyed. \lineBreak Let us be clear. The only reason the NDP wishes to retain these records is to reinstate the long gun registry whenever it is in the position to do so. What we will do is abolish the long gun registry once and for all. "
1169,"Mr. Speaker, the minister's answer is no excuse to destroy life-saving data that would help police keep our streets safe. The Conservative government's plan is tantamount to a $2 billion bonfire. It wants to destroy the data that police use 17,000 times a day and which the police have asked the government to keep. The police deserve a fighting chance against gun crime in Canada. If provinces also want to maintain this information for their own use, they should have the right to do so. \lineBreak Why is the government handcuffing law enforcement in Canada by burning all the records?","Mr. Speaker, as one woman from the Georgian Bay Women's Outdoors Workshops stated:"
1170,"Mr. Speaker, Toronto is the latest city to join others in Canada and across North America in banning the sale and use of shark fins. Up to 75 million sharks are finned and thrown away at sea every year, often while still alive. \lineBreak Will the government work with us to end this practice and ban the import of shark fins to Canada?","Mr. Speaker, shark finning is an offensive practice. It has been banned in Canada since the early 1990s."
1171,"Mr. Speaker, today Allen Oberg confirmed that he will be launching a reckless and baseless legal challenge against the federal government for bringing marketing freedom to western Canadian farmers. \lineBreak In September of this year he stated: \lineBreak  Mr. Oberg is actively working to prevent marketing freedom for grain farmers by using any means possible.  \lineBreak As Mr. Oberg launches this reckless legal challenge, will the ","Mr. Speaker, as a government we not only have a right to change legislation, we have a responsibility to deliver on our promises. \lineBreak Farmers have earned the right to market their own grain, whether on an open market or through a voluntary Canadian wheat board.  \lineBreak The director of the Wheat Board said today as he resigned: \lineBreak  That says it all."
1172,"Mr. Speaker, homelessness and the lack of affordable housing are not just big city problems. In my riding of Trois-Rivières, the Le Havre shelter does not have enough beds to meet the demand. I would like to congratulate all the community organizations that have become involved and offered their assistance, but it is only a short-term solution. \lineBreak When will this government take care of families in need and adopt a long-term strategy to provide Canadians with affordable housing?","Mr. Speaker, two years ago we extended the five-year program for housing and homelessness. Through our economic action plan we have 14,000 projects under way to build, or renovate existing, affordable housing operations. \lineBreak Unfortunately, we did that in spite of the NDP, because that party voted against every one of these initiatives to help people get the housing they deserve."
1173,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are true believers in the abolition of the firearms registry. \lineBreak In addition to abolishing the registry, now they want to destroy all its records. This would prevent Quebec, which has asked for the data, from salvaging a tool that saves lives, a tool that has cost nearly $2 billion in public money—part of that from Quebec, a tool the Conservatives now want to trash. What a waste. \lineBreak Does the Conservative government, which brags about its openness toward Quebec, intend to reply to the request by Quebec's public safety minister to have the data returned, or will it again thumb its nose at the unanimous will of the National Assembly of Quebec?","Mr. Speaker, our position has not changed. We made an election promise to abolish this expensive and ineffective long gun registry. We have a bill before Parliament, and I hope that the opposition members will support us, because we feel that there is a consensus among Canadians to have effective measures to fight crime. This registry has not prevented criminals from obtaining firearms."
1174,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's police want to continue to access the data in the long gun registry. The Province of Quebec would like to use the data to create its own gun control system.  \lineBreak This is no more a matter of privacy than car registration. Why is the government so intent on destroying a database that could be so useful to the provinces? Why does the government think it can destroy the past and control the future?","Mr. Speaker, the registry has nothing to do with keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. \lineBreak In order to protect the privacy of law-abiding long gun owners, those whom that member and his party subjected to gross violations of their privacy, records held by the Canadian firearms program on currently registered long guns will be destroyed. \lineBreak Let us be clear. The only reason the NDP and the Liberals want those records maintained is in order to reinstate the long gun registry, should they ever form a coalition to do so."
1175,"Mr. Speaker, firefighters from across Canada were in Ottawa to discuss three vital issues that are as much about the safety of all Canadians as they are about support for our front-line rescuers. Firefighters are asking for a national public safety officer compensation benefit, amending the National Building Code and providing priority access to vaccines. \lineBreak As firefighters are the first to respond to an emergency and constantly put the well-being of others before their own, will the ","Mr. Speaker, I had a great opportunity yesterday to have this discussion with the member who posed the question this afternoon. \lineBreak As I stated yesterday, protecting the health and safety of Canadians who are most at risk must be a priority for any government during a pandemic. The chief public health officers in the provinces and territories, who are the medical experts, recommend vaccine priority according to the nature of the pandemic virus and the risk to the population. As well, the provinces and territories delivering health care are also responsible for the rollout of vaccines in their jurisdictions."
1176,"Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister has time, I suggest he tour the Australian wheat board. This once-proud single desk marketer benefited family farmers for decades before a reckless conservative government dismantled it. How did that work out? Wheat growers lost leverage, countless family farms failed, and the defunct board was sold off to an offshore big agri company. \lineBreak Why is the government repeating that failed experiment?","Mr. Speaker, the reality is we are focused on the Canadian Wheat Board. \lineBreak The truth of the matter is, Canadian wheat growers for years have sought freedom to market their own product. \lineBreak It is unfortunate that the NDP is trying to use undemocratic measures, dirty tricks and intimidation.  \lineBreak What western wheat farmers want is freedom. That is what they will get with the Conservative government."
1177,"Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the spokesman for the government could indicate clearly whether the ","Mr. Speaker, I can certainly assure the questioner from the Liberal Party that on every occasion that the "

1180,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that the government was embarking on an almost half a billion dollar offer on a new satellite system. The program is already delayed and wildly over budget in the U.S.  \lineBreak Could the minister confirm that he is going ahead with the Canadian version of this program anyway, and in terms of transparency and accountability, why is this the first that Canadians are hearing about it?","Mr. Speaker, our efforts in Afghanistan and Libya have proven that the ability to exchange information between headquarters and deployed elements is critical to the success of modern military operations. This government intends to meet this requirement while ensuring the best value for taxpayer money. As such, we have sought an agreement with our allies that provides the Canadian Forces with access to an international constellation of satellites."
1181,"Mr. Speaker, the minister will appreciate that Canadians are nervous about the government getting us into yet another big, expensive, sole-sourced boondoggle: the Chinooks, the F-35s, the Cyclones.  \lineBreak We have been here before and it has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and this sure looks like another boondoggle in the making. \lineBreak What will the minister do differently this time to make sure that it does not happen again?","Mr. Speaker, space continues to be an important part of the global security environment. The Canadian Forces space-related activities are an essential component of a robust defence for Canada and North America, wherein are the F-35s and the other assets that we are providing for our men and women in uniform to do their work, and also to maintain Canada's sovereignty."
1182,"Mr. Speaker, over the past week the  \lineBreak My riding is home to CFB Esquimalt, and people want to know how far these cuts will go? Will the minister stand in the House today and assure the sailors and families at CFB Esquimalt that support for our Pacific fleet will not be cut?","Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member for  \lineBreak With respect to his question, he would know that this memorandum, this directive, he is referring to makes no reference whatsoever to base closures. \lineBreak I repeat to him, as I said to his friend from Hamilton, that the only people talking about closure of bases are members of the NDP and one Liberal senator."
1183,"Mr. Speaker, in 2008 Corporal Stuart Langridge was found dead in his barracks.

Again, it would be inappropriate to comment at this time."
1184,"Mr. Speaker, the Commonwealth is at the crossroads with respect to human rights. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka, where the United Nations has confirmed that there are credible allegations of atrocities committed during and after the war. The Commonwealth must not condone this.  \lineBreak Will the Conservatives show leadership and ensure that the next Commonwealth meeting does not take place in Sri Lanka unless it accepts an independent UN investigation of alleged war crimes?","Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Canada will continue to speak loudly and clearly on behalf of human rights around the world, and especially Sri Lanka."
1185,"Mr. Speaker, at the Commonwealth meeting in Australia, the Canadian government must take a firm stance against impunity. However, a unilateral boycott of the next meeting in Sri Lanka is far from enough. Instead of isolating itself, Canada must be a leader within the Commonwealth. \lineBreak What initiatives will this government take to ensure that other countries agree to hold the meeting elsewhere, unless Sri Lanka agrees to an independent investigation of alleged war crimes?","Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada's position is very clear. The  \lineBreak He has said he would like to see Sri Lanka move forward to address the allegations of human rights abuses. If there is no credible movement toward addressing that issue, he will then rethink his attendance at the next Commonwealth Conference in Sri Lanka."
1186,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak  However, despite the fact that the Governor of the Bank of Canada says our economy “is slowing to a crawl”, this out-of-touch Conservative government refuses to act now and create jobs in Canada. Canadians are tired of the government's continued inaction. \lineBreak We believe in action on this side of the House. We put forward a plan. When will the government finally implement our plan to create jobs and kickstart the Canadian economy?","Mr. Speaker, that is quite an action plan, standing and voting against anything that the government puts forward that actually will help create jobs. Canadians should be very fearful if that is the action plan from the NDP. \lineBreak  We have continued with a plan, a jobs and growth plan from the government. It is working. In fact, so are nearly 650,000 more Canadians."
1187,"Mr. Speaker, my colleague said that everything is going well, but the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, who has a bit more credibility, said this week that the Canadian economy was weakening considerably. The government is not taking action to stimulate job creation. In the meantime, other countries are taking action. It takes hard work. Canadian families have seen enough inaction from this government. It is as simple as that. \lineBreak When will the government get to work to ensure that people have jobs?","Mr. Speaker, I forgot the other component of the NDP plan, and that is to tax Canadians by another $10 billion. We do not think that is a good plan. It was in the NDP platform that it campaigned on. \lineBreak  I think that is why we have a majority Conservative government: because Canadians expect a plan that will help Canadians get back to work, that will help balance the deficit, and that will help all Canadians. That is what we are going to do. \lineBreak We hope that the NDP might see the error of its ways and actually support us on that."
1188,"Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada's Dartmouth office is slashing 18 to 43 staff, devastating vital research on toxic substances, having the impact of axing studies on important environmental impacts of salmon farms and on poisonous mercury fallout from U.S. coal-fired power plants. \lineBreak Our environment cannot stand the government's death by a thousand cuts. When will the minister stop sending these skilled workers to the unemployment line and start doing his job of protecting our environment?","Mr. Speaker, every assumption in my hon. colleague's question is absolutely and totally wrong."
1189,"Mr. Speaker, the government is taking boutique tax credits to a whole new level. \lineBreak Millions of lower-income Canadians want their children to play hockey or take piano lessons, or would like to volunteer as firefighters. Under this government, millions of lower-income Canadians, who do not earn enough to pay taxes, will not get the tax credit. \lineBreak Why is the government leaving lower-income families out in the cold with their noses pressed to the window looking in?","Mr. Speaker, I am not sure why that hon. member would ask for more tax credits for Canadians, because every time we put that forward the Liberals vote against it, including, as we just saw, the firefighters. They actually voted against a tax credit for volunteer firefighters. \lineBreak The other thing they voted against, which I still cannot quite understand, is an increase in the guaranteed income supplement for seniors, the largest increase in GIS that we have seen in 25 years. They voted against it."
1190,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians living in our fastest growing provinces and cities have become significantly under-represented due to population growth and an out-of-date seat allocation formula.  \lineBreak Under the current rules, a majority of Canadians will not only remain but becoming increasingly under-represented. This representation gap must be addressed. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, today I introduced Bill  \lineBreak Canadians rightly expect fair and principled representation in their democratic institutions.

The project is shovel ready. Millions have already been spent by the province and city. \lineBreak Would the Conservatives explain why they left Edmonton out in the cold again?","Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that no funding has been withdrawn from this project by the federal government. We committed $30 million to this project. It was announced the day the project was announced. We are still committed to that funding. We have not withdrawn any funding from this project."
1192,"Mr. Speaker, we all know that the $30 million was promised by the previous government. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak The Conservative government committed money to Alberta under the building Canada fund.  \lineBreak Do any other Edmonton MPs share my concern? Will any of them stand up for Edmonton and demand this funding be restored?","Mr. Speaker, the funding that the member is speaking of was never allocated. Our commitment was for $30 million and it stands. We are not withdrawing those funds from the project. We cannot withdraw funds that we have never given. \lineBreak I will explain for the member that out of the $30 million, the Government of Alberta has only accessed $10 million, so there is still $20 million there for it to access immediately should it be needed for the project today."
1193,"Mr. Speaker, this government brags about its efforts to acknowledge the War of 1812, but in the meantime, our museums and our history are in jeopardy. The Canadian Museum of Civilization had to lay off a number of its historical interpreters as well as support staff because of the government's cuts. \lineBreak When will this government realize that our museums are integral to culture? ","Mr. Speaker, let us look at the facts. In the global economic crisis, which began in 2008, Canada—our government—was the only government in the G8 to make one key decision: it did not cut or maintain its investment in culture, but increased it. That is our heritage. We have made investments and will continue to make the targeted and significant investments our culture needs."
1194,"Mr. Speaker, maintaining services with fewer resources is another fine contradiction of this government. Our museums are the lastest victims of these major cuts. They are the guardians of our collective history, in addition to being a significant driver for the tourism industry and our economy in general. The Conservatives are in the process of putting our cultural reputation at risk. \lineBreak When will this government stop making cuts to arts and culture?","Mr. Speaker, in both questions, my hon. colleague mentioned the issue of museums. Our government is the first government in Canadian history to create a national museum outside of the national capital at Pier 21 in Halifax. We also created the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. We passed the legislation. We provided the funding for it. The Liberals talked about it, but we delivered. \lineBreak When it comes to museums, we have offered more support for small museums than ever before. We are the government that is delivering for culture in a fiscally responsible way that serves the interests of both culture and everyday taxpayers.  \lineBreak They promised the Canadian Museum of Human Rights; we delivered it. They are all talk; we acted."
1195,"Mr. Speaker, last September, a crown corporation evicted the Canadian Air and Space Museum. While the volunteer-run museum showed its good faith and developed a viable plan to meet its financial obligations, the reason stated for eviction was for non-payment of rent. However, other tenants who were evicted at the same time were told that hey had to go so that Downsview Park could implement its vision. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, as I said in a similar question from a member of the NDP on this very subject, even though it is called the Canadian Air and Space Museum, the fact is that it is a private museum with a private collection. It is not owned by the Government of Canada. By the way, this is an organization that had a fundraising campaign that was not nearly as successful as it had hoped it would be. It has not had the number of visitors it had hoped it would have.  \lineBreak However, I have instructed Mark O’Neill, the president of the Museum of Civilization, to reach out to this museum to talk and work with it about the collection it has and see if there is something we can do to preserve the collection. \lineBreak The decision made by Downsview is an independent decision that was made in the best interests of taxpayers. I am sorry the Liberals do not agree with that."
1196,"Mr. Speaker, there are huge areas of open space that house this museum. Downsview Park has chosen to destroy these heritage buildings, which once was home to de Havilland Canada, in order to build a hockey rink. \lineBreak  If the government truly cares about heritage and military history, as the minister is indicating, then what is he doing to save, not only the artifacts, but also these historic buildings that are important to the people of Toronto and to all Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I certainly recognize the importance of the collection, which is why I have taken the action I have described in the first question. I do not doubt my hon. colleague's sincerity. What I do disagree with though is the this or that proposal. \lineBreak  We can have strong, fantastic, brilliant national museums that protect our heritage, and we are doing that. At the same time, however, Downsview Park has a responsibility to do what is in the best interests of taxpayers, and that is what it is doing.  \lineBreak If the idea is that we cannot have a sports complex, new rinks or support sports and at the same time protect the collection of this museum, I think we can do both. I think we will do both, and we will do so responsibly for taxpayers."
1197,"Mr. Speaker, the Muskoka minister said that if he were caught setting up a parallel process that kept the Auditor General in the dark that he would turn himself over to the cops. \lineBreak Local mayors were told that all projects would be vetted by civil servants, but he broke that promise and set up a parallel process run by the three amigos: the mayor, the hotel manager and the minister. He then hid the documents in the office, which meant that the Auditor General was left in the dark. \lineBreak When will he do the right thing and check himself into the old crowbar hotel?","Mr. Speaker, the facts have not changed. As a great Canadian once said, “the facts have not changed”. They have not changed since yesterday and they will not change tomorrow. The minister of infrastructure made the decision. The Auditor General has thoroughly reviewed it. We know where every dollar went. \lineBreak Now, while the facts have not changed, that member's position has changed. He has broken his promise. By standing up and talking about broken promises today, he now appoints himself the House's high priest of hypocrisy. Why does he not stand in his place and apologize for breaking his word to his constituents?"
1198,"Mr. Speaker, I am hurt because I think we all know what we are really dealing with here, which is the wasteful, inefficient and ineffective President of the Treasury Board. \lineBreak  After 140 days of dodging the facts, the facts have indeed not changed, because the infrastructure minister did not choose the projects. He rubber-stamped the list that was handed to him by the Muskoka maverick. The reason he cannot get up now is that if he stands up, he is busted for explaining why his fingerprints are all over the file.  \lineBreak Will he stop hiding behind the backbench, get up and be accountable to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, the former minister of infrastructure has been clear. He approved all of the projects, 32 of them. We know what they are. If the hon. member would like to go to the website for Infrastructure Canada, he could review those projects himself. Every dollar is now accounted for. The projects came in either on or under budget. \lineBreak That cannot be said about the $2 billion Liberal long gun registry, against which that member fought for years in his effort to be re-elected in his riding. \lineBreak Will he now be consistent with the position that he has always taken and announce that he will vote for scrapping the long gun registry?"
1199,"Mr. Speaker, in many parts of the world, the rights, the safety and even the lives of girls and women are threatened by violence that has its source in perverse and distorted notions of honour. \lineBreak Regrettably, Canada has not been immune from such abuses.  \lineBreak Therefore, I ask the ","Mr. Speaker, honour-motivated crimes are nothing more than cruel acts of violence. Over a year ago, I called on community and religious leaders to outright condemn these acts of violence. \lineBreak I also asked women and girls who experienced this violence and intimidation to please speak out. We have held round tables, we have done outreach, and it has resulted in the funding of a project by the Indo-Canadian Women's Association, called the “Elimination of Harmful Cultural Practices”. This initiative will empower girls and women and engage community organizations, the legal community and law enforcement to better respond to the issues of abusive cultural practices. \lineBreak Our government continues to ask girls who are intimidated by this kind of violence to please speak out."
1200,"Mr. Speaker, it appears that the  \lineBreak First, there was the broken promise on the portrait gallery, then the Conservatives denied funding for the Edmonton folk music festival and then they failed to back Edmonton's bid to host the World Expo. \lineBreak The Conservatives have no trouble finding 50 million bucks to build gazebos in Muskoka, but when it comes to funding Edmonton's Royal Alberta Museum, it appears they are weaseling out of their previous commitment. \lineBreak Why does the government continue to show such disrespect for the capital of the province of Alberta?","Mr. Speaker, I should just correct the record. Our government has been proud to support the Edmonton folk music festival with funding. Again, I reiterate that our government has not withdrawn any funding from this project.  \lineBreak We committed $30 million to the Royal Alberta Museum. We are very proud to do that. That funding commitment stands and we have not withdrawn that funding."
1201,"Mr. Speaker, the transition to digital signals remains problematic for thousands of Canadians, including many people in my riding of Rivière-du-Nord. Thousands of households, many of them among the poorest, are getting fewer channels than before, even with a digital converter paid for out of their own pockets. In some regions of the country, Canadians cannot even get the CBC, even though it is our public broadcaster. \lineBreak Do Canadians now have to pay to watch the CBC? Is this the government's logic: no money, no ","Mr. Speaker, the transition is being done independently by the CRTC, as my colleague must know. The CRTC worked with our government and with the CBC to ensure that taxpayers who pay out of their own pockets could continue receiving CBC programming. The process will continue next year. It is ongoing. We are aware of the concerns expressed by the member, but this process is definitely an improvement. "
1202,"Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans made a recommendation for the government to create a task force to look into the management of the snow crab fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. We know that the Conservatives are not the best at taking advice. If they were, they would be examining the management of the fishery as a whole. That is fair enough. Perhaps we could look at one fishery problem at a time. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives listen to the committee and create a task force to look into the management of the snow crab fishery?","Mr. Speaker, as the member should know, this was a record year for Atlantic snow crab prices. I congratulate the fleets on a successful season. The long-term economic prosperity of the snow crab industry is my priority and the priority of my department. We are committed to ensuring that snow crab stocks are managed sustainably and we will work in close collaboration with the industry."
1203,"Mr. Speaker, the National Assembly of Quebec has supported the firearms registry on more than one occasion. Today, we have learned that Quebec opposes the Conservatives' plan to destroy the data. The National Assembly is saying “no” to this government because the police need this information to keep our communities safe. That is what the police want and that is what the Government of Quebec and the provinces want. \lineBreak Why is this government going to war against the police and the provinces?","Mr. Speaker, the requirements for obtaining a firearm licence, including a criminal background check, are still in place. The long gun registry was costly and useless and did not protect Canadians. That is the reality. That is why our government is finished with the firearms registry."
1204,"Mr. Speaker, that is not what the police and the provinces are saying. The homicide rate in Canada is the lowest it has been in 45 years, mainly as a result of fewer gun-related deaths. It is important to note that this decline is related in part to the firearms registry, which is consulted by police 17,000 times a day. The elimination of the registry is a problem, but the destruction of the data is even worse.  \lineBreak Why prevent the police and the provinces from accessing the data currently found in the firearms registry?","Mr. Speaker, that is not true. The bill also provides for the elimination of inaccurate and unreliable data. This situation is only getting worse with time. The police are entitled to their opinion,but the reality is that this registry does not work. \lineBreak We have seen there is no connection with the lowering of crime rates; the lowering of these statistics has no correlation with gun registration."
1205,"Mr. Speaker, it is clear from that answer the government does not have one good reason for blocking the provinces from protecting their citizens. It is not just provinces that find the government reckless; it is also law enforcement. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says that the complete loss of the firearms database would severely reduce the ability of police to trace guns in this country. \lineBreak Why is the government, in face of overwhelming evidence and opposition, moving forward with this reckless anti-police agenda and destroying life-saving data?","Mr. Speaker, in fact, the front-line officers have spoken very clearly on this matter. They recognize the mandate our government has received from the Canadian people and they are quite satisfied with the efforts this government has made on behalf of front-line police officers. \lineBreak What they are asking that member and his party to do is to support Bill  \lineBreak It is time the member stopped picking on farmers and sport shooters and hunters and started standing up for victims."
1206,"Mr. Speaker, the government's reckless move is already creating chaos, stripping a life-saving tool that is used 17,000 times a day by police. Provinces are already saying they will not comply. There is mounting opposition from police, mounting opposition from provinces. \lineBreak Why does the government not recognize the mounting opposition, transfer the data to the provinces and, as have the police have asked, to the Canadian National Firearms Tracing Centre? What does the government have against our police forces?","Mr. Speaker, the member knows that the figure he just mentioned is misleading. In fact, if he actually wants to hear from a government that believes the long gun registry accomplishes nothing, he should go to the provincial NDP in Manitoba which said that it does not care about the data destruction because it does not support the long gun registry because it is not effective."
1207,"Mr. Speaker, that is twice now that the  \lineBreak With respect to the selection of the Auditor General, yesterday his colleague said that they had chosen this candidate for the position because he was the most meritorious, despite the fact that the government itself insisted that the candidate should be bilingual. \lineBreak Is the position of the government that there was no candidate who was both meritorious and bilingual?","Mr. Speaker, once again, our government's position was very clear. The government looked for bilingual candidates. After an exhaustive process, the most meritorious candidate was chosen. Mr. Ferguson is an extraordinary person. He wants to learn French and has already started taking lessons."
1208,"Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure to ask the Thursday question. However, I am less pleased to see the government once again showing its undemocratic tendency by using the Standing Orders to restrict debate here in the House. \lineBreak Mr. Speaker, the rules are here to guide all of us. They have to be used judiciously and that is not what is happening. \lineBreak This will be the fifth time in 38 sitting days that a time allocation motion has been imposed. That is coming close to setting the same record that the Liberals set, which was heavily criticized by the current  \lineBreak Perhaps the government House leader could tell the House exactly what formula he is using to determine what is enough debate, because we heard that from him and the  \lineBreak We have had extreme limitations imposed on the ability to start the debate on this side of the House before it is cut off by a time allocation motion from the government. I could go through those, but I will not use up the time today. \lineBreak  We did not even have the opportunity to commence debate on the bill that is before the House today. Before our justice and public safety critic could stand on his feet, the government moved a time allocation motion. That is the kind of abuse we are seeing. We have not had a lot of debate on the bill, which has new provisions with regard to destroying records. We had two hours of debate on the long gun registry in the last Parliament, but it was a different bill because those provisions were not in it.  \lineBreak I ask the government House leader, how soon will he be moving a motion for time allocation on Bill C-20, which was tabled today? How much time will we be given? We on this side of the House want to know what the government considers a reasonable amount of time for debate. Perhaps I should put it this way: how little debate does the government think is reasonable before it slams the door shut and does not allow us meaningful democratic debate in this country?","Mr. Speaker, the issues we have been discussing in the House of Commons through this fall, for which we have brought in time allocation motions to clarify how long the debate will last, are issues that have been discussed at length over the past five or six years. They are issues that have been debated at length in elections. They are issues we have made commitments to Canadians on in the last election. Canadians responded to those commitments by giving us a majority and asking us to deliver on those commitments. Those issues have been debated in the public forum, the most extensive and important forum possible, where Canadians pass judgment and ask us to deliver on our commitments. The government is doing what it said it would do and will continue to do that. \lineBreak My approach with regard to time allocation is to move a motion as early as possible so that everyone is clear how much time will be available for debate. It is not to bring a motion at the very last hour to suddenly end debate. Rather, it is to allow people to plan for the debate.  \lineBreak When people at home are listening, they think that the concept of four days of debate is a lot of time, as in the case we are dealing with. In their workplace most people do not debate an issue for four days before they decide what to do. They debate it and they make a decision. In this case, there is enough time to make a very clear decision on an important question.  \lineBreak With regard to our agenda, next week will be democratic reform week in the House. We will focus on measures aimed at integrity and accountability, which the Conservatives committed to during the last election. The cornerstone bill will be the fair representation act, which was introduced earlier today. This important bill fulfills our government's long-standing commitment to move closer to representation by population in the House of Commons. It is a principle as old as the country, and at the core of the original drafting of our country's founding documents by Sir John A. Macdonald.  \lineBreak With that in mind, I have scheduled debate for this bill to begin next Wednesday and to continue on Thursday, after the opposition caucuses have had a chance to consider the bill. I trust that all parties will see that this is a good bill, and that they will support it. I look forward to this debate. \lineBreak I am also looking forward to the introduction of other legislation on democratic reform next week, and perhaps some other measures. I hope that there will even be time to continue debate on the Senate reform bill at some point next week. \lineBreak Before we get to Wednesday, we will continue to debate the ending the long gun registry bill this afternoon and tomorrow. The fourth day of debate will occur on Tuesday.  \lineBreak Key to integrity and accountability is the principle that a government should keep its commitments by repealing the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. We are doing what we said we would do. We are keeping our commitments to Canadians. \lineBreak Finally, next Monday will be the fourth allotted day."
1209,"Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the government House leader did not answer my question as to when he will move a motion for time allocation. \lineBreak Can I conclude from what the government House leader said that we will only get one day of debate on the seat redistribution bill? That sounds like that is what he will do, move to the reform of the Senate bill after one day of debate on the seat redistribution bill. I would ask him to confirm that.","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to confirm that is not the case. I apologize if I was not clear. I said in French that we will be debating the seat redistribution bill on Wednesday and we have also planned to debate it on Thursday of next week."
1210,"Mr. Speaker, the government claims to defend—",Order. The hon. member for 
1211,"Mr. Speaker, the government claims to defend victims and taxpayers. We have heard it all before. However, it is clear that it is turning its back on victims by eliminating the firearms registry. \lineBreak Victims themselves are saying this, and they have the support of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime. But the government does not care about taxpayers either, including Quebeckers who paid their fair share for collecting the data contained in the registry, data requested by Quebec's National Assembly. \lineBreak Why is there so much contempt for the rights of taxpayers in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, we made a very clear, very specific campaign commitment to destroy the registry. The registry is made up of data and information. We will be destroying the information because the information is the registry. We will fulfill our campaign promise and will continue to fight crime so that our streets are safer for Canadians. I invite the NDP to join us and vote in favour of these bills."
1212,"Mr. Speaker, we have learned that the government has decided to take the same strategy it is using with the gun registry and apply it to the Canadian navy: invest billions of dollars in procurement, only to throw it all out. The  \lineBreak Can the government confirm that it is getting rid of the Victoria-class submarines?","No, Mr. Speaker. Our government is investing to ensure that we have the ideal mix of naval capacities to protect Canada's sovereignty. We intend to continue working with the Canadian Forces to guarantee the best level of service in order to protect Canada's sovereignty. "
1213,"Mr. Speaker, it appears the government has already begun to move. Here is what the  \lineBreak We can all agree the Liberals did a terrible job when they bought the Victoria class subs. Canadians were misled about their true costs and capabilities. What Canadians wanted then and what they want today is certainty. \lineBreak Would the Conservatives confirm that their government is really ready to go down a multi-billion dollar rabbit hole of nuclear submarines?","Mr. Speaker, the quick answer to that is, no. I think the hon. member has to be wary of relying unduly on misleading reports from the CBC. \lineBreak What is true is that our government is investing in the right mix and balance for our forces to have a naval capacity necessary to defend and protect Canada's sovereignty on all our ocean frontiers. \lineBreak I can tell members and reassure the hon. member that there is no plan to replace the diesel-electric fleet purchased by the Liberals."
1214,"Mr. Speaker, it seems quite clear that the Conservatives have absolutely no plans for military procurement. This situation with the submarine fleet reeks of improvisation. In terms of our air force, the Conservatives' decision to purchase F-35s is making less and less sense. Even the government is starting to realize it. \lineBreak Will the government reconsider its untendered purchase of F-35s? ","Mr. Speaker, our commitment has been, clearly, to give our Canadian Forces members, including those in the Royal Canadian Air Force, the equipment they need to do the job well. The fact is, and reasonable people agree, we need to have new aircraft. The current CF-18s are, of course, aging aircraft that have been around for quite some time. \lineBreak We are moving forward, together with our allies, with the only fifth generation fighter of its kind. The F-35 is something that offers stealth capability and will protect our Canadian airmen and airwomen, so that they will be able to do their job protecting our sovereignty in the safest and most effective fashion possible."
1215,"Mr. Speaker, the pressure is mounting against the purchase of F-35s. Today, we learned that the  \lineBreak Will the government finally stop its F-35 boondoggle before it is just too late?","Mr. Speaker, the only boondoggle I know about these days is the gun registry. \lineBreak However, I am pleased to infuse a dose of reality into the opposition's misguided rant about F-35 aircraft. Recently, I saw first-hand the direct benefits of economic growth and job creation in Magellan Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg as with over 60-some other Canadians companies. \lineBreak Canadian families are benefiting from the production in Canada of F-35 components. Our budget is on track. It will create economic growth as well as look after the needs of our men and women in uniform and Canadian sovereignty."
1216,"Mr. Speaker, I would feel a bit defensive, too, if I signed on to a program that even conservative U.S. senator John McCain called “a train wreck”. Even our international partners, such as Australia, Israel and Turkey, are now delaying their commitment to the F-35s. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives finally admit their F-35 boondoggle is quickly unravelling and bring it to an end?","Mr. Speaker, the infusion of rhetoric on this very important acquisition of an asset critical to the sovereignty of Canada, providing our men and women the appropriate tools well into the future to do their job, is absolutely overwhelming. It is obviously because of political positioning. \lineBreak We are focused on what is necessary to maintain Canada's sovereignty. We are not playing politics. This is a critical asset that we intend to fulfill as we go forward."
1217,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Quebec National Assembly voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to grant access to the information in the firearms registry. Why will this government not recognize that this information is very valuable to the provinces and why does it still refuse to give in to common sense? \lineBreak I will ask the government once more here today. Is the government willing to make this valuable information available to the provinces?","Mr. Speaker, our legislation is clear. It will actually eliminate the long gun registry, and that means eliminating the records, which have become inaccurate and unreliable, and they will become increasingly so over time. \lineBreak We are bound to protect the privacy rights of Canadians and that includes the rights of those who are law-abiding gun owners who have participated in the registry. The existing licensing requirements, of course, are going to remain.  \lineBreak We are committed to eliminating this wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. We will not allow a backdoor re-establishment of the long gun registry."
1218,"Mr. Speaker, the reckless and spiteful decision to destroy all gun registry records shows just how out of touch the government really is. Yesterday, the Quebec National Assembly voted unanimously to demand the records be kept. It is even threatening legal action. \lineBreak The government is not just destroying records, it is destroying a key tool for keeping our communities safe.  \lineBreak Why is the government insulting provinces that want to create their own registry? Why is it playing politics with public safety?","Mr. Speaker, our commitment to Canadians was to destroy and end the long gun registry. \lineBreak The long gun registry is the data. The data is flawed, it is inaccurate, and it does not target criminals. It targets law-abiding Canadians. We will continue to have the licensing process. That information will be accessible to all law enforcement agencies. \lineBreak Make no mistake, we will end the long gun registry, which is the data."
1219,"Mr. Speaker, this government is deliberately turning a blind eye. The Government of Quebec is threatening to go to court to prevent the destruction of the firearms registry data. Quebeckers paid their share to establish this registry. Quebec families, the parents of victims of the Polytechnique and Dawson College massacres, and the president of Quebec's Association of Families of Persons Assassinated or Disappeared, established by Senator Boisvenu, are calling for gun controls to remain in place. \lineBreak Is this government going to eliminate this method of ensuring public safety?","Mr. Speaker, as we said during the election campaign, we will destroy the long gun registry. Why? Simply because this registry does not reduce crime. Those who say the contrary are spouting pure ideology. The crime rate has been decreasing for several years in Canada, but not because of the registry. That takes more stringent laws. This registry unfairly targets hunters and farmers by treating them like potential criminals. I hope that the Government of Quebec will respect the division of powers and Canada's jurisdictions. This is a federal jurisdiction, and we will destroy this registry as we said we would."
1220,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the National Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously to demand that the long gun registry records be kept. Quebec families paid for that registry, and they are asking that it now be given to them. I myself am a hunter, and maintaining this information does not limit my activities in any way. The Conservatives are saying that the data must be destroyed simply because it must be destroyed. When we ask them why, we encounter a black hole, much like their political agenda. \lineBreak Will this government finally be open with Quebec and grant its request to transfer the data?","Mr. Speaker, we are going to destroy the long gun—shotguns and rifles—registry data. Why? Because the registry is the data. That is what we said in our election campaign and that is what we are going to do. I am asking the Government of Quebec to respect the Canadian Constitution. This bill was created and established based on the Criminal Code, which falls under federal jurisdiction. It is in our power. We are doing what we have to do. We do not interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. We are destroying the registry because it is the best thing to do. We have laws, here in the House, to prevent crime."
1221,"Mr. Speaker, collecting the data in the firearms registry required an enormous investment. The registry cost a lot of money—it was clearly designed by those responsible for the sponsorship scandal—but now we have that data and we have a provincial government that is asking to be able to use it. As a hunter, I do not have any objection to sharing this information, so why is the government being so childish? \lineBreak Why spend taxpayers' money only to destroy data for which we all paid?","Mr. Speaker, the data in the long gun registry is inaccurate. That is what the Auditor General said in 2002 when she announced her findings with regard to this scandal, as the hon. member just mentioned. The registry was the first Liberal scandal. It was supposed to cost $2 million but it cost several million, if not close to $2 billion. We all remember the second Liberal scandal, the sponsorship scandal. For us, the important thing is that this data is not accurate, as the Auditor General said in 2002. This would be like giving a Trojan horse to the Government of Quebec."
1222,"Mr. Speaker, the hundreds of thousands of volunteers and overworked staff at Canadian charities were shocked when they opened their newspapers this morning. With no consultation and no plan, the government is recklessly considering slashing its contribution to Canada's charities unless they meet the Conservative government's narrow partisan agenda. \lineBreak Charity workers are not vacationing on Challenger jets, like the members opposite. They deserve the government's support. Instead of picking winners and losers, why will the government not stand behind Canada's vital charitable sector?","Mr. Speaker, we are always interested in new models to partner with private sector organizations to deliver results. This is why the minister has set up the voluntary advisory committee to discuss ways to leverage government funding and investments to ensure a maximum social impact to help those in need. \lineBreak While current funding models ensure fiscal accountability, our focus is to ensure that funding gets results and that taxes collected from hardworking Canadians have the biggest impact on those who really need it."
1223,"Mr. Speaker, that answer did not give comfort to a single charity in this country. \lineBreak There are about 83,000 registered charities in Canada, and they employ 10% of our country's workforce. Those are a lot of jobs and vital contributions that this country cannot afford to lose. We are talking about over one million hard-working Canadians who contribute to our country every day. They deserve better than to have their government undermine their important contributions and threaten their jobs. \lineBreak Would the government at least be honest with them about what it has in mind? They and the people they serve deserve nothing less.","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, we are looking at new models to make sure that we can leverage our government's commitment and leverage our government's investments to ensure that those most in need get what they need and get it soon. \lineBreak Unlike the NDP, which wants to tax individuals and make sure that we are not creating jobs in this country, we have focused on those in need by creating new models that provide them with opportunities to get what they need through charities. In fact, our finance committee is now looking at how to best leverage that, so I look forward to the NDP supporting our direction at the finance committee."
1224,"Mr. Speaker, today we learned that the government wants to change how it funds non-profit and charitable organizations. \lineBreak These organizations generally rely on volunteers and overworked staff. These organizations too often do the work of the Conservatives, who continue to back away from their social responsibilities, and now they are being told that they will receive even less government assistance.  \lineBreak Why is the government attacking these organizations that provide vital services to the people?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, we are working to build our charitable sector in this country. \lineBreak What the member opposite said is completely false. The minister has been working with a voluntary advisory committee to discuss ways to leverage our investments to ensure maximum impact for those in need. \lineBreak I encourage the NDP to get on board with what our finance committee is doing, making sure we leverage what is available to our communities and charities. I encourage all of those members to volunteer, as  I do with the YMCA."
1225,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in committee, the President of the Public Service Commission of Canada, Mrs. Barrados, had this to say: \lineBreak Since a mastery of both official languages was clearly indicated as essential for the position of Auditor General and the person appointed by the ","Mr. Speaker, the government looked for bilingual candidates. After an extensive process, a candidate was chosen because he was by far the most qualified. \lineBreak Mr. Ferguson is in the process of becoming comfortable in both of Canada's official languages, like many members here in the House. Mr. Ferguson has a proven track record within the provincial public service in New Brunswick."
1226,"Mr. Speaker, the only member of the government's selection committee for the position of Auditor General outside of government circles was a registered lobbyist by the name of Kevin Dancey, the head of the CICA.  \lineBreak The purpose of lobbying is to benefit the organization being lobbied for. While he was advancing a position on who the Auditor General should be, Mr. Dancey was also actively lobbying every organization on the selection committee, including the Office of the Auditor General. In future, the same individual will likely be lobbying the very same Auditor General he helped select. \lineBreak Does the government understand and realize the apparent and obvious conflict?","Mr. Speaker, the qualifications of our candidate for Auditor General are unparalleled. As an example, the former Auditor General, Sheila Fraser, says, “He will be a very good auditor general. He is very capable, a very nice person and I think once Parliamentarians get to know him, they will appreciate him”."
1227,"Mr. Speaker, let us see if the record is still broken. Yesterday, in response to a question from my colleague about the decision to appoint a unilingual anglophone Auditor General, the  \lineBreak Now, we all agree that the ","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, Mr. Ferguson is learning French, as are many members of this House and of the public service. If the member opposite doubts Mr. Ferguson's commitment, then perhaps he would like to come to the public accounts committee on Monday and ask him directly, as I am sure he will. \lineBreak As far as Mr. Ferguson's qualifications are concerned, he comes with excellent references. However, the member need not take my word for it. Let me share one reference with you. The reference states, “He will be a very good auditor general. He is very capable, a very nice person and I think once Parliamentarians get to know him, they will appreciate him”. \lineBreak Who said that? The former Auditor General herself, Sheila Fraser."
1228,"Mr. Speaker, it is obviously still the same broken record. If, after months of searching, they were not able to find an auditor general who, as the job poster indicated, was proficient in both languages at the time of hiring, it shows what kind of employers the Conservatives are. \lineBreak When a private company requires comprehension of both official languages, it means that it is a critical competence for undertaking the required work. Why are the Conservatives treating this requirement as a minor detail that can be set aside if it becomes an inconvenience?","Mr. Speaker, the government sought bilingual candidates. After a thorough process, the successful candidate was determined to be by far the most qualified. Mr. Ferguson has undertaken to become proficient in both of Canada's official languages and he has already begun training. Mr. Ferguson has a proven track record of public service in the province of New Brunswick, but do not take my word for it, here is a quote: \lineBreak Who said that? It was the Liberal leader, Victor Boudreau."
1229,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President of the Public Service Commission said that, in the public service, language is an essential requirement. This government continues to tell anyone who will listen that it has nothing against bilingualism and that the Auditor General is perfectly competent, except it has forgotten one important requirement: bilingualism. \lineBreak Did the government at least take the time to interview him and ask him a few questions in French before offering him the job?","Mr. Speaker, our government supports official languages. That is why we allocated over $1 billion to the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality. This represents an unprecedented investment meant to promote and protect bilingualism across the country. \lineBreak In regard to Mr. Ferguson, I have another quote. This comes from the premier of New Brunswick who said:"
1230,"Mr. Speaker, it is all well and good to want to favour one's friends instead of choosing the most competent people for essential positions, but when it is done at the expense of francophones from coast to coast to coast, that is unacceptable. The government cannot play the bilingualism card only when it wants to look good.  \lineBreak Will the government reverse its decision and appoint a bilingual auditor general?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, this government has done more for official languages than any other government in Canadian history, including investing over $1 billion in our road map for linguistic duality. \lineBreak Mr. Ferguson is the most qualified candidate for the job. We have many different people quoted as saying that and we will stand behind our candidate."
1231,"Mr. Speaker, how does the minister explain the unfair treatment of Quebec when it comes to the cuts at Canada Post? The cuts in Quebec are alarming at 53%, when elsewhere in the country they are only 4% to 8%.  \lineBreak How does the minister explain that Quebec is not entitled to the same postal service as the rest of the country?","Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is a crown corporation that is at arm's length from the government. In fact, all Canadians are entitled to the same service from this corporation, but we will not interfere in the day-to-day management of this organization."
1232,"Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is avoiding questions on the cuts at Canada Post and continuing to give vague answers. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, in fact, it is the New Democrats who tried to extend a work stoppage at Canada Post. They are the ones who contributed to the interruption of service to Quebeckers and all Canadians. \lineBreak It is our government that took action to ensure that Canada Post's services are available to all Canadians across the country."
1233,"Mr. Speaker, the Canada Post office in Dorion, Ontario, is also about to close, forcing families to drive up to 75 kilometres just to pick up a package, despite the fact that Canada Post has claimed that there is a moratorium on the closure of rural post offices.  \lineBreak Postal service is vital for rural families and especially seniors in communities like Dorion. They should not need to drive almost an hour just to get to the post office.  \lineBreak Would the minister stand up and assure Dorion families that post offices will not close?","Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is a crown corporation, independent from the government. It does provide services to Canadians coast to coast. Those services are provided regardless of region and without discrimination. We will not interfere in the daily operations and management of an independent crown corporation."
1234,"Mr. Speaker, what kind of leadership is that? \lineBreak Rural Canadian communities, like Dorion, are being left out in the cold by Canada Post. Last year alone, despite its promised moratorium on such closures, Canada Post padlocked postal outlets in 37 different towns. Thousands of families are cut off from the rest of the country, even while Canada Post raked in $233 million in profit. \lineBreak When will the minister and the government stand up for rural communities? When will they stop robbing them of their needed postal services?","Mr. Speaker, obviously, we are standing up for rural communities. That is why the government is working to eliminate the wasteful long gun registry that has harassed farmers and hunters for far too long. That is why we are giving freedom to western farmers. \lineBreak On the subject of Canada Post service, it is a little rich for the NDP, which attempted to prolong the work stoppage at Canada Post, to now stand in the House of Commons and claim that it wants to extend the services. It wanted to prevent Canadians from any region of the country from having Canada Post service by prolonging that work stoppage. Thank goodness our government stepped in and ordered it back to work."
1235,"Mr. Speaker, another week goes by with yet another story about the F-35 procurement unraveling before our very own eyes.  \lineBreak Having bought into the program hook, line and sinker, the  \lineBreak What is it that the Minister of National Defence is doing to pull the plug on this program, which is in its own death spiral?","Mr. Speaker, there is no intent to pull the plug on an asset that is so critical to Canadian sovereignty and provides our men and women the assets they need well into the future to fulfill their missions and return home safe at the end of those missions to their families. \lineBreak As well, we are now into cutting steel. This is not a reversal item. This is the right plane, the right aircraft for the right time and well into the future. We made that decision. In fact, the Liberal government of the day in 1997 embarked on this very same project."
1236,"Mr. Speaker, now even the babysitting minister whistles past the graveyard. \lineBreak Serious countries explore alternative procurement strategies. Indeed, some of them have already pulled out of the program altogether.  \lineBreak What kind of a minister sticks with a program where he does not even know the final cost? Open procurement is the only answer. Why will the minister not pull out of this program before he crash lands us all?","Mr. Speaker, the hypocrisy here is beyond belief. \lineBreak That is the same government—"
1237,"Order, please. The associate minister has the floor.","Mr. Speaker, that is the same government of the day that embarked on this very same project, and now it has cold feet. That is the same government of the day that sent its men and women into battle in danger zones in Afghanistan, in a desert setting, wearing green uniforms."
1238,"Mr. Speaker, this week the Privacy Commissioner sounded alarm bells again, raising serious concerns about the Conservative government's lawful access legislation. The Privacy Commissioner said that Conservatives had not justified the sweeping search and seizure powers they plan to foist on commercial ISPs. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I will be perfectly clear. No legislation proposed in the past, present or future by a Conservative government would allow for police to read emails without a warrant. As technology evolves, many criminal activities, such as the distribution of child pornography, becomes easier, and we are proposing measures to bring our laws into the 21st century. \lineBreak I find it remarkable that the same party that wants to look at the private records of law-abiding gun owners wants to protect potential child pornographers."
1239,"Mr. Speaker, that was an answer, but not to my question. \lineBreak This is again about the Privacy Commissioner. The commissioner said that this proposal to hugely expand surveillance and weaken judicial scrutiny went far beyond what is needed. According to the commissioner, better alternatives exist to give police the investigative tools they need while still preserving the privacy of Canadians. \lineBreak When will the government finally acknowledge these serious privacy concerns and agree to fix the bill?","Mr. Speaker, our proposal will not allow for access to private communications without a warrant. What we are proposing is a balanced approach between checking on those who may be distributing child pornography and the right of individuals to have their information remain private. \lineBreak We ask the NDP to support this good legislation to get it to the 21st century, but also to support the private records of law-abiding long gun owners in this country."
1240,"Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, a large earthquake struck eastern Turkey. Over 600 aftershocks followed the devastating earthquake and reports say that thousands of people have been left homeless.  \lineBreak Under the leadership of our  \lineBreak Could the parliamentary secretary tell the House what Canada's response is to this recent disaster?","Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this morning the  \lineBreak We are sending 500 winterized tents to Turkey. The tents will ensure urgently needed emergency shelter for 500 families, and we will continue to monitor the situation there."
1241,"Mr. Speaker, some time ago, the Government of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador signed an MOU for a loan guarantee covering the Muskrat Falls electrical project. Since then, we have heard nothing. \lineBreak  In our province, commitments from the government are often taken with some degree of skepticism. We wonder if this is really a commitment, or is it a scheme to keep the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in line? \lineBreak My question is for the minister responsible for Newfoundland and Labrador. Has the government completed its due diligence analysis and is it on time for final approval, or is this just another tactic it is using to keep the provinces in line?","Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the commitment we made to Muskrat Falls. We will continue to show support. This is a very important economic development project for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and, in fact, for all the people of Atlantic Canada. It offers the prospect of clean energy at low cost and economic development and growth and jobs.That is the focus of our government: economic growth and job creation."
1242,"Mr. Speaker, for 14 years, Canada's firefighters have been coming to Parliament Hill to ask that their families be taken care of through a public safety officer compensation fund if they die in the line of duty or if they die saving others.  \lineBreak Five years ago, the NDP delivered, and we passed legislation through the House directing the government to do this. Since that time, dozens of Canada's firefighters and police officers have passed away, and their families are often left destitute. The United States has a fund, but Canada does not. \lineBreak Why will the government not establish a public safety officer compensation fund and why is it showing such profound disrespect to Canada's firefighters and police officers?","Mr. Speaker, this is a government that is listening to firefighters and police officers across the country. Not only are we giving police officers the tools they need to do their job, but we also introduced a firefighters volunteer tax credit which has been supported across the country. It is something firefighters asked for. It is helping them. We respect and appreciate the work they do. We will continue to support them. \lineBreak We ask the opposition to do the same thing. We ask the opposition members to vote for measures that will keep criminals in jail and not out on the street."
1243,"Mr. Speaker, Maikel Nabil is a young Egyptian blogger, one of the early voices of the Tahrir Square revolution. He became the first political prisoner in the post-Mubarak era. \lineBreak  He was sentenced by a military tribunal in March to three years in jail on a bogus charge of insulting the Egyptian army and was further compromised by his pro-Israeli views. He is now in the 66th day of a hunger strike and has become, like the Christian Coptic community under assault, a symbol of the betrayal of the Tahrir revolution. His life hangs in the balance. \lineBreak Will the government immediately seek his release from prison?","Mr. Speaker, we are concerned about this situation. We take it very seriously. I can advise the House that we are in consultation, not just with authorities in the country but with like-minded partners, to address this situation. It is a very high priority for our government."
1244,"Mr. Speaker, the government could end up depriving the Canadian economy of millions of dollars in tourism spinoffs, because tourists from the countries for which Canada requires a visa must go through a completely arbitrary process. Every year, one out of every five visitors is denied entry to the country. There are no clear criteria, guidelines or standards for granting entry. \lineBreak What is this government doing to make the tourist visa process fairer?","Mr. Speaker, I am happy that my counterpart is interested in tourism. This industry is very important to Canada. I want to say that we are working with the "
1245,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Conservatives introduced a bill that would irreversibly decrease Quebec's political weight. The Quebeckers in this House have an obligation to object to this assault on the Quebec nation and denounce the bill. \lineBreak The National Assembly has spoken out three times and Quebec's minister of intergovernmental affairs has made it clear, “...there is an exceptional consensus; Quebec does not want to see its weight decreased.” \lineBreak Will the government respect the Quebec nation and correct its bill in order to maintain Quebec's current political weight?","Mr. Speaker, we have introduced principled legislation that is fair for all provinces. Quebec has 23% of the population and will have 23% of the seats in the House of Commons.  \lineBreak The fair representation act would bring every single province closer to representation by population. We on this side of the House are governing for all Canadians."
1246,"Mr. Speaker, too many seniors are unable to retire when they had hoped to. According to a Sun Life study, the majority of workers will stay on the job well past the age of 65, not by choice, but simply because they lack the money to retire. Seniors lost their savings during the recession and this government does not have a plan to fight poverty among seniors. \lineBreak When will this government stop the corporate giveaways and take action that will allow seniors not to spend their retirement years in poverty?"," Mr. Speaker, we have worked hard to enhance retirement security for Canadians, especially our seniors. \lineBreak For example, we have reduced taxes for seniors and retirees by $2 billion, mainly by allowing pension income splitting. We restructured the framework for pensions that are under federal jurisdiction in order to better protect retirees. Together with the provinces, we have reviewed proposals for making other improvements, and we are about to implement the new pooled registered pension plan, or PRPP. We hope that the NDP will support this measure."
1247,"Mr. Speaker, we obviously do not live on the same planet. There are more and more Canadian seniors who have too much debt and not enough income.","Order, please. The hon. member for Marc-Aurèle-Fortin."
1248,"Mr. Speaker, the number of poor seniors is increasing. The Conservatives have a simple answer: let the financial markets provide guaranteed pension plans for Canadians. That is their answer. We know what happened during the recession. That strategy resulted in lost income because of the downturn in the financial markets. \lineBreak When will the government finally support Canadians and double Canada and Quebec pension plan benefits? It should do so immediately.","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we strive continually to help our seniors. We introduced several bills and the NDP voted against them. We are continuing, as are the provincial governments, to work on reforming the Canada pension plan, but, like many of the provinces, we share the concerns of small businesses and others with respect to any increase in costs at a time when the global economy is barely recovering."
1249,"Mr. Speaker, TD Bank said yesterday what we all knew already, that the government will not balance its books until 2017, after the next election. \lineBreak This is bad news for Canadian families, who have been told they had to wait until the budget was balanced for any of the government's promised support for families. \lineBreak Why do Canadian families have to wait in line for six years to receive any support while the largest, most profitable corporations in the country get their tax cuts right now?","Mr. Speaker, my Liberal friend opposite has a very short memory. \lineBreak We delivered tax cuts for Canadian families in the form of lowering income taxes, in the form of tax reductions for things like a sports and fitness tax credit, and participation in the arts tax credit. We reduced the GST twice. \lineBreak What all those events had in common was that the Liberal Party voted against them. Our party is the only party committed to reducing taxes. We continue to be the only party in this House committed to reducing taxes. \lineBreak  We are also committed to getting our budget balanced in the medium term to ensure that we keep Canada's fiscal advantage, one that has delivered 650,000 net new jobs to Canadians and is leading the G8 in growth."
1250,"Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense for these Conservatives to delay support for families until after the next election when, with any luck, they will be out of power. Also, Canadians are going to wake up to a nasty surprise on January 1, an EI payroll tax increase. \lineBreak Could the government explain by what twisted logic Canadian families must wait and watch while the government levies a massive tax on jobs and refuses to provide them with any support?","Mr. Speaker, Canadian families did wait for help in the form of reduced taxes for 13 long years. \lineBreak However, since 2006, they have been receiving those benefits from our government, benefits that now total, for a typical Canadian family, over $3,000 less in taxes paid. That is over $3,000 more in their pockets. That is one of the reasons the Canadian economy has been performing well. \lineBreak We have avoided the path that the Liberals would have us go, the path that other countries are on--that of high taxes, high debt and high deficit it is the very path that is causing threats to the global economy from elsewhere. \lineBreak Here in Canada, we have avoided that path. That is why our economy is strong, and we will say on that path."
1251,"Mr. Speaker, the latest GDP numbers show a stagnation of the economy with one exception, the oil and gas sector, thanks to the Conservatives' favouritism. However, high productivity sectors like manufacturing and infrastructure were flat or down. \lineBreak Is this not further evidence that we should prolong the stimulus package and target high productivity sectors?","Mr. Speaker, the government's position is that we should keep going down the path that we are on because it is working. The IMF says so. The World Bank says so. Today StatsCan again says so. What we are doing is working.  \lineBreak Since the worst part of the recession in July 2009, the Canadian economy has produced over 650,000 jobs, more than 80% of which are full-time jobs. We are getting the job done for Canadians and that is why they have entrusted our government to continue focusing on the economy."
1252,"Mr. Speaker, not only are Conservatives refusing to act to help our economy, they are also turning off the taps of the previous stimulus package. \lineBreak The city of Hamilton stands to lose $7.8 million in infrastructure funding today. There is no reason for the government not to invest the money that was budgeted for infrastructure. \lineBreak Why not ensure that every penny allocated to stimulate the economy will actually go to stimulate the economy?","Mr. Speaker, I would simply point out for the  \lineBreak Now we are moving to the next chapter of our economic action plan, which is drive to a balanced budget, while putting in place policies that drive up economic growth and create jobs for Canadians. It is what we promised to do. It is what we are going to do."
1253,"Mr. Speaker, this does not help the economy. \lineBreak The GDP numbers should wake the Conservatives up. The economy needs further stimulus, not an abrupt end to the money already promised. \lineBreak In Saint-Eustache, for instance, work was delayed because of federal red tape. The city is not to blame, but the Conservatives are using that as an excuse to cut funding for the bridge to Îles Corbeil. \lineBreak Instead of cutting off the stimulus funding, why not prolong or even expand the program?","Mr. Speaker, we already extended our process in order to allow that project to be completed. We created a responsible, effective process for the entire economy, and we worked on that process with the municipalities and the provinces. \lineBreak Let us be clear, however: our process, our program, our economic action plan and our plan to deal with this crisis are all working. We are creating jobs. Our economic system is improving. Our work is not done yet. Our work will be done when all Canadians can find the jobs they need, and we will continue on the same path with next year's budget."
1254,"Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the ","Mr. Speaker, where it is necessary and we think it is valuable, we employ fairness monitors to be a part of procurement. In this situation, with the shipbuilding procurement strategy, it was invaluable."

If members use up all their time when a minister is giving an answer, they may find themselves short of a question. \lineBreak The Associate Minister of National Defence.","Mr. Speaker, partner nations were engaged during the competitive process, and this led to the selection of the Lockheed Martin and its partner agencies as the joint fighter manufacturer for our needs at this time and well into the future."
1257,"Mr. Speaker, it seems that every week the opposition asks a straightforward question and every week the  \lineBreak It is a simple but very important question, so I will ask it again. When will the Conservatives finally admit that the F-35 scheme is in a tailspin? When will they start putting Canadian taxpayers first, cancel the F-35 and establish a transparent and competitive process for the replacement of the CF-18?","Mr. Speaker, through a process launched by the previous Liberal government in the late 1990s--"
1258,Order. The minister has been asked a question and he has the right to answer it. The hon. minister has the floor.,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada determined that the F-35 is the best and only aircraft that meets the needs of Canada's armed forces."
1259,"Mr. Speaker, last week a Commonwealth summit was held in Australia and discussions were held on human rights. Australia and Great Britain raised the issue of decriminalizing homosexuality. Sadly, homosexuality is a crime in 41 of the 54 Commonwealth countries. Decriminalizing homosexuality is a fundamental human rights issue. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, the promotion of human rights abroad is a central part of Canada's foreign policy. At the Commonwealth meetings last week, Canada was outspoken on the criminalization of homosexuality. We spoke very strongly against it. We will continue to work with our allies, like the United Kingdom and Australia, on this issue in the days, weeks, months and, regrettably, years to come."
1260,"Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this weekend in Perth, Canada failed to get the Commonwealth to move on this basic human rights question. What we need is for every Commonwealth leader who believes in ending the state persecution of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and the transgendered to step up right now. \lineBreak The government has a historic opportunity to provide leadership on this issue which it claims to care about. Could the minister tell me, why did the government fail in Perth? What is the government's plan to take action now to assert leadership on this issue in the Commonwealth?","Mr. Speaker, let me assure the hon. member opposite and colleagues on all sides of the House that Canada was the loudest voice on this issue in Perth. We spoke out strongly against it. It is very clear, regrettably, that we will not see immediate changes in this regard, but it is important that we continue to push for human rights, whether it is for gays and lesbians, whether it is for religious freedom, whether it is for women, whether it is for other persecuted minorities. Canadians can count on this government to continue to fight for those issues."
1261,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' preoccupation with Arctic defence is proving to be more rhetoric than reality. If they did care about defending our northern sovereignty, they would not be buying a plane that cannot communicate in the Arctic, cannot land in the Arctic, and cannot refuel anywhere. The F-35 simply does not meet Canada's needs. \lineBreak Therefore, when will the Conservative government hold an open competition to determine the aircraft best suited to all of our needs, including the Arctic?","Mr. Speaker, I think the rhetoric around this issue has gone on for an awfully long time. However, the reality is that back in 1997, the Liberal government of the day started this project.  \lineBreak It is the best aircraft for the men and women of our military today and into the future, and as well to ensure that we have control over our sovereignty in years to come."
1262,"Mr. Speaker, why do we not go back to Laurier?  \lineBreak The minister considers it a successful procurement if a plane cannot refuel anywhere, cannot land in the Arctic, cannot communicate in the Arctic, and has only one engine to boot. Instead of holding an open competition to get best value for money, the Conservatives lecture the world on fiscal responsibility. \lineBreak With structural deficits as far as the eye can see, why can the Conservatives not control the skyrocketing costs of the F-35?","Mr. Speaker, reasonable people agree that we need aircraft to defend Canadian sovereignty. We will ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment to do their jobs safely and effectively. We expect communications of our aircraft and all other aspects to be in place and that they will exceed current and future capabilities. \lineBreak The F-35 will ensure that Canada's interests at home and abroad will be well served."
1263,"Mr. Speaker, the total cost of the F-35s is now more than $30 billion, even though the government is denying it. With such a large financial commitment, we must have guaranteed economic spinoffs for Canadian companies, but the Conservatives are dropping the ball. Thirty billion dollars in expenditures and no guaranteed economic spinoffs. That is a fine present for Lockheed Martin in Texas. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to infuse a dose of reality into this whole argument. \lineBreak Recently I saw first-hand the direct benefits of economic growth and job creation at Magellan Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg, as well as that which has taken place in over 60 other companies across the land. \lineBreak It is not only about the F-35; it is about jobs, it is about economic growth, and it is about providing our men and women with the best tools they need to do their job."
1264,"Mr. Speaker, today, I had the honour to table in the House a motion to prohibit the use and mining of asbestos. The evidence is clear: asbestos is an industrial killer. Yet the government continues to blindly support this industry. Canada is the only member country of the United Nations to oppose the inclusion of asbestos on a list of hazardous materials. \lineBreak Who is this government defending: the workers and families who are the victims of asbestos or large corporations?","Mr. Speaker, Canada has promoted the safe and controlled use of chrysotile asbestos domestically and internationally for more than 30 years. Recent scientific reviews confirm that chrysotile fibres can be used safely under controlled conditions. The government respects provincial jurisdiction over the development of natural resources. The NDP would put entire communities out of work and put those workers permanently on welfare. These are the people we are protecting."
1265,"Mr. Speaker, reasonable voices across the country are standing up to the government's support of deadly asbestos. \lineBreak  Here is just one: “I have made the decision that the production and export of asbestos is contrary to the best interests of Canadians”. \lineBreak Do members know who said that? It was Dona Cadman, the former Conservative member for Surrey--North. \lineBreak Will the government finally act in the best interests of Canadians and support the New Democratic motion to ban asbestos?","Mr. Speaker, scientific reviews confirm that chrysotile fibres can be used safely under controlled conditions. \lineBreak Our government respects provincial jurisdiction over the development of natural resources. \lineBreak The hon. member should appreciate the efforts that are being put in place to avoid a ban of nickel, and it is the same thing for chrysotile asbestos."

1267,"Mr. Speaker, it is the inaction of this government that is putting workers in a mess. \lineBreak The asbestos mine workers are worried. Asbestos is a hazardous product. The industry is dying and is no longer even supported by the entire Conservative caucus. Despite all that, it is not getting any help from this government. This government prefers to put short-term profits ahead of the long-term well-being of the asbestos workers and victims. This is unacceptable. \lineBreak Will this government do the right thing and facilitate the transition of the workers and their families to other sources of income as soon as possible?","Mr. Speaker, Canada has promoted the safe use of chrysotile at home and abroad for more than 30 years. This is a policy that has been supported by the chrysotile asbestos industry workers, as a matter of fact. I do not know what planet the hon. member has been living on to have such concerns, but I can say that they are unfounded because it is the workers who came up with this safe use policy. Let us be clear: chrysotile fibre can be safely used in a controlled environment, under the regulations in effect. \lineBreak Our government respects the jurisdiction of the provinces over natural resources development."

1269,"Mr. Speaker, new documents show that the Muskoka minister used the G8 as a cover to promote a white elephant vanity project called the Summit Centre. It was sold as a dorm for the media that never came. \lineBreak One email is particularly disturbing. In it the minister says:  \lineBreak Where is the paper trail for this vanity project? If the minister does not have the paper trail, then he is going to need to explain why he used Treasury Board as a partisan cash machine. ","Mr. Speaker, it will not come as any surprise to the member opposite that I do not agree with the premise of his question. \lineBreak The government funded 32 public infrastructure projects. All 32 projects had contribution agreements. All 32 projects came in on or under budget. All the documentation was presented to the Auditor General. She has given some good advice on what we can do to be even more transparent and more accountable to Parliament. We completely agree with her wise counsel."

The government dinged the town for an extra $9 million. \lineBreak My colleague from foreign affairs keeps saying this was an arm's-length project. There was nothing arm's-length about it: the minister was up to his neck in pork-barrel partisan politics. \lineBreak Will the minister explain why he was using Treasury Board to get money for a bogus project like this, which had no justification or paper trail? Where is the paper trail?","Mr. Speaker, this project, like the other 31 projects, had a full contribution agreement that was drafted by officials at Treasury Board. This project is a public infrastructure project that will benefit the people of that municipality for many years to come. \lineBreak We look forward to having the opportunity to answer even more of the member opposite's questions at committee in short order."
1271,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's tourism market share continues to plunge. We have dropped from seventh to fifteenth in international tourism visits. \lineBreak The government's failed tourism policies are costing Canada's economy and small businesses thousands of jobs and billions of dollars each year. The government's solution is to treat air travel as a cash cow, slap visitor visas on our most dynamic markets and increase EI payroll taxes. The government's so-called “strategy” is a disaster. \lineBreak When will the government heed the industry's alarm bells and take action?","Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the good news announced by my colleague must be seen as a positive. Businesses in the tourism industry make huge contributions to the Canadian economy and to creating jobs. We implemented Canada's federal tourism strategy to better coordinate the government's efforts, to support the tourism industry and to help Canadian tourism businesses become more competitive, seize opportunities and create jobs for Canadians, so yes, we are accomplishing things and are delivering the goods."
1272,"Mr. Speaker, one must be bilingual in order to hold the position of Auditor General of Canada. It is not just the francophones in this country who demand it; the  \lineBreak Canadians want to know: was the appointment process fair or did the government once again give one of its friends preferential treatment?","Mr. Speaker, that is completely untrue. As we have already said, of course the government looked for bilingual candidates. However, upon completion of a rigorous process, the best-qualified candidate was chosen. Mr. Ferguson has said that he wants to learn French and he is already taking courses. "
1273,"Mr. Speaker, I do not understand why the government did not advertise the job again to give all anglophones a chance to apply. This is not the first time that this government has misled Canadians. \lineBreak How did a unilingual candidate get through the interview process? Was he not asked any questions in French? This is a direct affront to bilingualism. \lineBreak One has to wonder: did the government or someone in the government suggest that Michael Ferguson apply for the job even though he is not bilingual?","Mr. Speaker, as we have already said, Mr. Ferguson is a very well-qualified candidate. As we have also already said, he has already started learning French. \lineBreak I would only add that he is getting rave reviews, including from the former Auditor General, Sheila Fraser, who has indicated her support for his candidacy."

1275,"Mr. Speaker, the bill killing the Canadian Wheat Board will be before a legislative committee starting this evening. \lineBreak While the government cut off discussion, allowing only three days of debate, western grain farmers and Canadians as a whole still have a right to better understand the devastating impact of this legislation. \lineBreak Will the government allow this committee to travel out west to allow access to the committee and hear from experts and farmers who will be affected by this legislation? Will the government commit to televising the proceedings so Canadians are not left out of this important process?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians have not been left out of this important process. It has gone on far longer than the member knows. It went on long before he was ever involved in it. \lineBreak Our government is committed to passing the marketing freedom for farmers act in a timely and orderly manner to ensure market certainty for farmers. They need market certainty for next year, and we intend to do that as quickly as possible. \lineBreak This legislative committee is an ideal place to examine the bill and its technical nature."
1276,"Mr. Speaker, while Conservatives make cuts to the University of the Arctic, northerners are wondering what happened to the government's commitment to the north. \lineBreak  As Philip, one of many who has emailed me with these concerns, wrote: “How does the Prime Minister's commitment to Arctic sovereignty, issues of sustainable development and expansion of Canadian understanding of, and co-operation with, peoples of the North coincide with his government's slashing of funding for the University of the Arctic?”  \lineBreak Where is their commitment to the north? What is their answer to Philip and other northerners?","Mr. Speaker, we have and continue to make important and strategic investments to strengthen the economic prosperity and quality of life of northerners. The Government of Canada continues to support the University of the Arctic; however, we have also advised it that we cannot continue to be the only source of funding for this initiative. \lineBreak Territorial support is crucial to its long-term sustainability and success in Canada. The territories have indicated they wish to explore other options. We respect this decision."
1277,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime and gave our Conservative government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. That is why in the last election we promised to introduce lawful access legislation in due course.  \lineBreak Our approach to this issue has always struck an appropriate balance between police powers needed to protect public safety and the necessity to safeguard the privacy of Canadians. However, there have been exaggerated concerns presented by the opposition. \lineBreak Could the minister tell the House what our proposed approach to the lawful access legislation will do?","Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear: no legislation proposed by our Conservative government will allow police to unlawfully read emails without a warrant.  \lineBreak As technology evolves, many criminal activities, such as the distribution of child pornography, become much easier. We are proposing measures to bring our laws into the 21st century and provide police with the tools they need to do their job.  \lineBreak Rather than making things easier for child pornographers or organized crime, I call on the NDP to support these balanced measures to protect law-abiding Canadians. "
1278,"Mr. Speaker, the NDP is calling on the government to stop hiding behind cabinet confidences and to respond to our access to information request by immediately making reports on the safety of the Champlain Bridge available to the public, instead of hiding them from the bridge's users. Every day, 200,000 people cross that bridge, and they have a right to know about its condition.  \lineBreak Will the government finally reveal the information that the cabinet members share freely among themselves, but refuse to share with Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, if the NDP was truly worried about the safety of the Champlain Bridge, it should have voted in favour of our budgets that invested in maintenance for the bridge in 2009. We are doing the work needed to ensure the structure's safety. While the NDP's priority is to scare Canadians, we are looking towards the future with the construction of a new bridge over the St. Lawrence. I therefore invite the hon. member to support us when it comes to replacing the old bridge with a new one."

1282,Order. The hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage has the floor.,"Mr. Speaker, the only person who had trouble with the question was the Liberals in taking three tries to spit it out. \lineBreak  However, the answer is that we are going down the road to ensuring that the Canadian Forces have the equipment that they need. As we have said time and again, the reality is that the greatest threat to the health and safety of the men and women of the Canadian Forces should never be their equipment. What we saw under 13 years of Liberal rule was a constant degrading of the Canadian Forces' budgets, and that can never happen again. If the leader of the Liberal Party does not like the process with regard to the F-35s, all he has to do is look to his left and look to his right, because it is his party that started it."
1283,"Mr. Speaker, I clearly heard a personal insult directed at me. Frankly, I am astonished that the minister would stoop so low. I am not going to return the minister's insults; instead, I am going to ask him a question.  \lineBreak If the use of a fairness officer is good enough for the ships, why is it not good enough for the planes? It is a very simple and direct question. ","Mr. Speaker, the answer is the same whether the question is asked in French or in English. Our process has been clear from the outset. We will ensure that the men and women of the Canadian Forces have the equipment they need to do their job—the job that Parliament and our government is asking them to do. That is what we have done here. The F-35s are a success for these women and men, and we are going to continue with our process."
1284,"Mr. Speaker, we are seeing some absurd situations as a result of the Conservatives' irresponsibility when it comes to the firearms registry. For example, owners will no longer be required to register the semi-automatic Ruger Mini-14. The Ruger Mini-14 is the weapon that was used in Norway this past summer. It is also the weapon that was used at the École Polytechnique. \lineBreak If the  \lineBreak Why destroy all the data? Why endanger our police officers?","Mr. Speaker, the firearms classification system has been around for a long time. We are following the process that was set out a long time ago. There are no changes to that in our bill."

They would rather destroy the data and put the police and the public at risk, but we do not understand why. \lineBreak Say that in a house there is an armour-piercing gun, a Steyr HS .50, an L115A3 long-range rifle and a TAR-21 assault rifle, but the police do not know because the  \lineBreak Abdicating his responsibilities is one thing, but why refuse to give the provinces the existing data?","Mr. Speaker, this government committed to eliminating the ineffective long gun registry and we do not intend to help other levels of government create registries."
1286,"Mr. Speaker, let me quote the Conservatives'  \lineBreak Does the  \lineBreak Does he agree with his Associate Minister of National Defence that it is an obvious concern for our police officers to know where these guns are when they respond to a dangerous situation?","Once again, Mr. Speaker, the system for the classification of firearms was established long ago. The government follows the process. It is not changed in any way by the bill. \lineBreak The government has been clear. It favours the elimination of the long gun registry. The government will not do anything to support the creation of a registry by other levels of government."
1287,"Mr. Speaker, under the legislation, semi-automatics and armour-piercing sniper rifles, even those capable of dropping a target two kilometres away, will no longer need to be registered. The government is making it easier for these dangerous firearms to fall into the wrong hands. \lineBreak The government likes to talk about hunters, but the last time I checked, hunters were not going after armoured targets one and one-half kilometres away. \lineBreak How is the government's decision to remove the last line of defence against these high-powered rifles in the interest of public safety?","Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate the members opposite are relying on a very misleading  \lineBreak  Claims that our government has changed the process for classification of firearms are simply not correct. In fact, the current process was put in place by the former Liberal government and that process continues."
1288,"Mr. Speaker, they are required to be registered now. \lineBreak The Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle was the weapon used by Marc Lepine in Canada's worst-ever mass shooting in Montreal. Now the government wants to remove restrictions from this weapon and others like it. \lineBreak As if trashing years of valuable registry records in spite of victims' pleas was not enough, now the government is removing controls over high-powered rifles. \lineBreak Why is the government making it harder to track who has these dangerous weapons? Why has it not learned from the past?","Mr. Speaker, it is very unfortunate the member engages in that type of fearmongering that is misleading. He knows it is misleading. \lineBreak Claims that our government has changed the process for classification of firearms are simply not correct. The fact is that the current process was put in place by the former Liberal government. That process is continuing."

I would encourage the Liberal Party to stop finding excuses and instead to support those important initiatives."
1290,"Mr. Speaker, we urge the  \lineBreak Employment insurance premiums result in job losses. I am not the only one to think that; so does the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. Why does the government not change its strategy in order to give the poorest families a chance?","Mr. Speaker, every time this government proposes tax cuts for families and SMEs to Parliament, the Liberal Party does not support them. That is an irresponsible position. There are other measures before this Parliament. I encourage the Liberal Party to change its position and support these measures, which are important for our families and our businesses. "
1291,"Mr. Speaker, we learned today just how badly the government is failing families. A whopping 851,000 Canadians used food banks in March 2011 alone, the second highest number ever. The Conservatives boast about their recession fighting skills, but food bank use has jumped 26% since 2008. Fighting a recession means helping families recover, not just giving big corporations tax breaks. \lineBreak Why is the government letting struggling families rely on food banks? Why is it leaving them out in the cold?","Mr. Speaker, we all know that tackling this problem requires a plan, and we have a plan.  \lineBreak The best way to fight poverty is to get Canadians working. The economic action plan is doing just that by helping grow our economy and by creating 650,000 net new jobs since July 2009. \lineBreak Every action we are taking is to help Canadians and their families become independent and help them to contribute to the economy and to their communities.  \lineBreak Whether it be the working income tax benefit or helping lower income families get over the welfare wall, we have a plan and we are implementing it."
1292,"Mr. Speaker, we are talking about working families who have jobs, but they still cannot afford to pay their bills and feed their kids. Food banks say that working families--I am talking working families here--are being left to struggle thanks to part-time low-wage work. The IMF and Mark Carney both say we should be worried about our economy. How much more proof does the government need?  \lineBreak When will the government stop relying on misleading job numbers and come up with a real plan to kickstart job creation for families in need?","Mr. Speaker, as I just mentioned, the best way to fight poverty is to get Canadians working. The economic action plan is doing exactly that with over 650,000 net new jobs since July 2009. Every action we are taking is to help Canadian families, allow them to become independent and help them to contribute to the economy and their communities. \lineBreak Why are the members of the NDP not voting for these initiatives to make sure that Canadians can have a successful job and a successful future?"
1293,"Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that it is difficult to live with a disability, physical or intellectual. It seriously compromises a person's ability to make a living. Canada has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This government must fulfill its commitment and take real action to help persons with disabilities. \lineBreak The government has clear responsibilities towards all Canadians. What does it intend to do to discharge those responsibilities?","Mr. Speaker, no government has done more to support Canadians with disabilities than our Conservative government has done. Our government is removing barriers to participation in the economy and communities because the participation of Canadians with disabilities in our economy means that they are successful and we as a nation are successful."
1294,"Mr. Speaker, there is a dramatic increase in the number of people visiting food banks for help. One in seven of them is someone with a disability. People with disabilities are not being hired, including in the public service. According to the president of the Public Service Commission, the situation just keeps getting worse. \lineBreak Why will the government not do more to fix this embarrassing situation and encourage the hiring of people living with disabilities?","Mr. Speaker, we thank the president of the Public Service Commission for her work. Certainly we see that some of the measures we put in place are indeed working in terms of the diversity of the public service workforce and ensuring that it is a robust public service that is reflective of our community. We will continue to work in that regard."
1295,"Mr. Speaker, the guaranteed income supplement was put in place 40 years ago to address seniors' poverty in Canada, but because of the government's failure to keep up with the times, seniors are falling behind. Costs are rising on everything from food to home heating. Once again, seniors are being left out in the cold. We learned today that the number of seniors using food banks has escalated over the past decade. \lineBreak What is the government's plan to help impoverished Canadian seniors?","Mr. Speaker, I will take no lesson from an opposition party which has voted against all of our measures to help seniors. Canada's seniors have--"

1297,"Mr. Speaker, of course we voted against it,  because the government's so-called plan left too many seniors at the food banks' doors. \lineBreak We could act on seniors' poverty right now. New Democrats have put forward a practical, affordable plan to increase the GIS and lift every senior in this country out of poverty. We have the blueprint. All the government has to do is act. \lineBreak Could the government explain its inaction on seniors' poverty?","Mr. Speaker, Canadian retirement security is a priority of the government. That is why our government continues to take strong action to support seniors. Since 2006 the government has provided billions in annual tax relief for seniors and pensioners, removed hundreds of thousands of seniors from the tax rolls completely, introduced the largest GIS increase in a quarter century and made significant investments in affordable housing for low income seniors. "
1298,"Mr. Speaker, since 2008, the number of Quebeckers turning to food banks has jumped by 22%. Poverty is affecting an increasing number of people, but the government continues to turn a blind eye. The Conservatives are so out of touch with reality that they chose to put an end to government stimulus measures. That is completely unacceptable. \lineBreak What real steps will the government take to stimulate the economy and create jobs?","Mr. Speaker, I feel a bit like I am in the movie  \lineBreak The best way to fight poverty is not the NDP's approach of increasing taxes; it is about providing people with jobs."
1299,"Mr. Speaker, we keep asking the same questions because the government does not understand. \lineBreak More than 60% of the Quebeckers who use food banks have exhausted all of their resources and are now living on social assistance. They are stretched to the limit, but the government keeps saying that all is well. \lineBreak What will this government do to give them a hand up? What is the government waiting for to help them find affordable housing and return to work?","Mr. Speaker, I will try to say it again, once and for all, so that the NDP really understands what we have done to reduce the tax burden on families. \lineBreak We proposed a new children's arts tax credit, but the NDP voted against it. We proposed a new family caregiver tax credit. What did the NDP do? They voted against it. We proposed a new and improved medical expense tax credit. What did they do? They voted against it. The list goes on."
1300,"Mr. Speaker, the government has to stop hiding in gopher holes. Food bank use is up 80% since 2008 in our northern communities, and that does not even tell the whole story. Families in many of our remote communities do not even have access to food banks. We are entering another cold winter. Why is the government allowing northern families to be left behind? When will it create an anti-poverty strategy that helps northerners who cannot afford to feed their families?","Mr. Speaker, let us go through some of the things that this government has put forward that the NDP has voted against: the working income tax benefit, to help make work pay and help low-income families get over the welfare wall; tax cuts, which mean over a million low-income Canadians do not pay income taxes at all anymore; enhancing the national child benefit, and the child tax benefit. These are all things we have put forward as a government to help Canadian families, and the NDP has voted against them all. "
1301,"Mr. Speaker, open democracy allows for proper debate and differing opinions. First the Conservative government ignored the farmer-held plebiscite favouring the single desk, then it refused to hold its own plebiscite, then it limited debate in the House on  \lineBreak Conservatives closed their minds and they closed the doors. Why is the government closing opportunities for farmers to be heard?","Mr. Speaker, the committee met last night and agreed that it would meet tonight. It is going to meet tomorrow night and the night after. We are going to put 16 hours of meetings into this one bill, and I think most Canadians would find that to be adequate. \lineBreak Farmers in western Canada need certainty. We are not sure why opposition members continue to stand in the way of their having certainty for marketing their grain next year. We would ask them to join with us and support Bill "
1302,"Mr. Speaker, a year ago the Conservative government made a clear commitment to respect the agreement between Omar Khadr and the U.S. government. It promised to bring him back this year to face justice in Canada. Now the government is going back on its word and saying it could take up to 18 months if the permit is returned at all. \lineBreak Why is the government misleading our allies and retreating on its commitments?","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Khadr, in fact, did face justice. He pleaded guilty to very serious crimes, including the murder of an American medic. \lineBreak Decisions regarding the international transfer of offenders are made by me in my capacity as Minister of Public Safety, and at all times I put the safety of Canadians first. A decision will be made on this file, as on all applications, in due course."
1303,"Mr. Speaker, clearly, the entire process currently under way in Guantanamo does not in any way comply with Canadian, American or international human rights standards. The Supreme Court's decision is clear and this House was clear: Omar Khadr must be returned home to face justice here. \lineBreak Why is the government now questioning the repatriation of Omar Khadr?","Mr. Speaker, I have great faith in the rule of law, including the application of law by the United States supreme court. Mr. Khadr pleaded guilty to very serious crimes. He murdered an American medic and he voluntarily pleaded guilty to that charge. \lineBreak Decisions made regarding the transfer of a criminal like Mr. Khadr are made under the International Transfer of Offenders Act, and my concern in that context is ensuring that public safety is maintained."
1304,"Mr. Speaker, first the placeholder NDP leader, in a speech to her old public sector union, falsely claimed that unemployment was on the rise; in fact, Canada has created over 650,000 net new jobs since July 2009. Then, yesterday, the NDP made a wild accusation about this government's funding of the world-class Perimeter Institute in Waterloo using bogus data.  \lineBreak Could the minister of state for science and technology please update the House on the facts?","Mr. Speaker, I share my colleague's concern on this issue. I again call on the NDP to check the public accounts and apologize to Canadians. \lineBreak The Perimeter Institute is a world-leading centre for physics research. We support it because its discoveries will create the jobs of the future and strengthen our economy. That is what we are focused on.  \lineBreak I invite the NDP to get on side and join us to help Canadians. I invite it stop misleading Canadians, to stop these cheap political games, to apologize, and to let us move on with helping the country."
1305,"Mr. Speaker, it is strange to see that most of the time, science comes from this side of the House. I would like to point out to the  \lineBreak The maximum spending authorized for the Perimeter Institute was $50 million over five years. But in 2009-10 alone, according to government documents, we can see that spending was $127 million, which is 10 times higher than the authorized annual spending, and the institute did not even receive the money. \lineBreak The government is talking about a technical error. Are $117 million technical errors common at the Treasury Board? Where did the money go?","Mr. Speaker, I am quite sure that the member supports the kind of science that suggests pigs can fly. \lineBreak The fact is that the NDP members are absolutely wrong. I invite them to check the public accounts, clear their facts with Canadians and apologize.  \lineBreak The Perimeter Institute is the world leader on theoretical physics. We support it because it leads to better jobs in the economy. I ask the NDP to stop purposely misleading the House and Canadians and to apologize."
1306,"Mr. Speaker, we will never apologize for revealing errors and this government's mismanagement. It is pathetic to hear answers that are cheap shots designed to distract us from the facts. The Perimeter Institute does excellent work and we salute them. Personally, I love the study of particles and especially the superstring theory. However, what we are talking about here is that the President of the Treasury Board is responsible for estimates. We know that he has a talent for discreetly transferring money to secret funds. \lineBreak What is he going to do to make sure these errors do not happen again?","Mr. Speaker, I would like, once again, to refer the NDP to the proper records. It is very simple. It is the public accounts for 2010 which show in fact that the NDP is misleading Canadians. I have the records here and I would be happy to table them at the end of today. \lineBreak  Even the Liberal MP for "

I know your credit card is maxed."" \lineBreak This is not how it is supposed to be done. Where is the paper trail? Where were the bureaucrats? If this were really arm's length, why would he be sending Blackberry messages promising to get cash in person?","Mr. Speaker, at the height of the economic downturn, the government has supported some 23,000 public infrastructure projects in every corner of the country. The good news is that some 650,000 net new jobs have been created. \lineBreak The Auditor General has looked at that initiative and, by and large, has been quite satisfied with it. When it comes to the G8 legacy fund, she has given some very thoughtful observations on how we can be more open and more transparent to Parliament, and we have completely accepted that advice."

1311,"Mr. Speaker, because of the decision to eliminate the gun registry, dangerous weapons will be circulating freely in our society. Owners of the powerful Ruger Mini-14, the weapon used by Marc Lépine and in Norway last summer, will not have to declare their weapons. The same applies to sniper rifles with bullets that can rip through armour from 1.5 kilometres away. These weapons are used for intimidation; they are not used by farmers. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives allowing these dangerous weapons to go unmonitored?","Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is not getting rid of the licensing provisions. It is getting rid of the long gun registry. It is unfortunate that the member is relying on a very misleading   \lineBreak Claims that the government has changed the process for the classification of firearms are simply not correct. The fact is that the current process was put in place by the member's government, the former Liberal government. "
1312,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government's candidate for the position of Auditor General appeared in committee, and this has left several unanswered questions, particularly concerning the recruitment process. The selection criteria were very clear and although the Conservatives are trying to downplay the importance of the language criterion in its selection, the candidate chosen does not meet one of the essential requirements. \lineBreak Can someone from this government confirm that the firm hired to find candidates was mandated to find a bilingual candidate, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, as I have already said in this House, the government looked for bilingual candidates and followed a very rigorous process. The best-qualified candidate was chosen. Mr. Ferguson said yesterday in committee that it was important to learn French. "
1313,"Mr. Speaker, that is not an answer. We still do not know if the headhunting firm hired by this government was instructed to find a bilingual candidate. The job posting clearly lists the following requirement: proficiency in both official languages is essential. It became clear yesterday that this is not the case for the candidate proposed by the Conservatives. \lineBreak My question for the government is simple: was the firm mandated to find a bilingual auditor general, yes or no? Respecting Canada's two official languages is not difficult. Yes or no? ","Mr. Speaker, I already said that the government did seek bilingual candidates, but at the end of the day, it is very important to have the most qualified candidate, the person with the most qualifications, and that is who we looked for. \lineBreak Mr. Ferguson is supported by Ms. Fraser, the former Auditor General, by the Liberal leader in the province of New Brunswick and by the premier of the province of New Brunswick who have all dealt with him for years. \lineBreak He is the right candidate for this position."
1314,"Mr. Speaker, in his testimony today Quebec justice minister Jean-Marc Fournier regretted that the government, in its Youth Criminal Justice Act, proposed the incarceration model--this as opposed to the rehabilitative model, which has brought about the lowest recidivism rate in Canada. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, certainly we have made a number of modifications to that bill. I invite hon. members to continue their study of it and to have a look at them. These are very reasonable. The bill balances rehabilitation with the legitimate interest of protecting the public.

1315,"Mr. Speaker, Jean-Marc Fournier, who speaks on behalf of Quebec, the National Assembly of Quebec, the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse, and the Association des centres jeunesse du Québec have said loud and clear that they do not want this automatic imprisonment system. They have also said that Quebec is not prepared to pay for it. \lineBreak Given that the ","Mr. Speaker, I heard the hon. member and I find it very difficult.

1317,"Mr. Speaker, the government took 13 months to even start acting on its own rail service review. \lineBreak What it has started is yet another review, with no deadline for actually doing anything. This process is in never-never land, while shippers of everything from grain to forest products, minerals and chemicals continue to suffer costly substandard rail service. \lineBreak The Conservatives quickly slapped closure on farmers. Why not a little closure on the railways, after 13 months of lost time and who knows how many more months yet to come? Why do the Conservatives side with the railways?","Mr. Speaker, after 13 long years, Canadians called for closure on a Liberal government. One of the reasons they did that is that the Liberals refused to do anything with rail for 13 long years.  \lineBreak Our government has worked with great success with stakeholders to improve the supply chain of shipments for everyone involved in the economy, from the railways to marketing facilitators. With regard to the facilitator, an announcement will be made shortly."

However, we should not be building 19th century transportation to get them where they need to go. \lineBreak Why will the government not show some environmental leadership and help build an electric rail line to Toronto's airport?","Mr. Speaker, this government has provided unprecedented amounts of funding for rail infrastructure throughout Canada. \lineBreak If the member were really sincere about representing the people of Toronto, he would have stood and voted with this government on all our historic investments for infrastructure. Why does the member hate Toronto? "
1322,"Mr. Speaker, by passing Bill  \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, I appreciate anything about fighting crime is very upsetting to what is left of the Bloc Québécois, but these pieces of legislation have been before Parliament and have been in the public realm for quite some time. \lineBreak I am very pleased that since this government took office, we have increased our transfers to the provinces by 30%, $2.4 billion in the last year alone. That is the right approach to this. We will continue to help the provinces in that regard."
1323,"Mr. Speaker, I have the accurate research that clearly shows the Perimeter Institute received, and continues to receive, the funding that respects this government's promise. I would like to table this document to set the record straight. I would encourage the NDP to read the actual research and to stop making it up and misleading Canadians. With the permission of the House, I would table the public accounts document.",The minister does not need the permission of the House. He can table whatever he likes.
1324,"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to set the record straight on the family—","Order, please. Setting the record straight is not a point of order. It is a point of debate. I would invite the hon. member to perhaps raise it in question period or in statements by members, but setting the record straight is not to use up House time as a point of order."
1325,"Mr. Speaker, are the documents tabled by the minister in both official languages?","Order, please. It has come to the attention of the Chair that the document is in only one official language. Therefore, I would ask the Minister of State for Science and Technology to either provide a copy in both official languages or seek the consent of the House to table it in one official language."
1326,"Mr. Speaker, I commit to tabling it in both official languages. I guarantee the facts are exactly the same. The research is consistent. The numbers are the same. The NDP is wrong, in both official languages.",We will wait for the document to be tabled in both official languages.
1327,"Mr. Speaker, on that point of order, I do not know why the member referred to both being the same in both official languages. We do not have to laugh at our official languages of our country. We should respect that. There is something that happens with the government in disrespecting both official languages.",The minister has committed to tabling the document in both official languages and the House will wait for that before it is officially tabled. \lineBreak I would like to thank the hon. member for 
1328,"Mr. Speaker, more than 40% of first nations homes without running water are located in St. Theresa Point, Wasagamack, Red Sucker Lake and Garden Hill. These are the very communities that were devastated by H1N1 and are still victims of the lack of federal leadership and commitment that leaves their communities at high risk to this day. \lineBreak Will the minister take responsibility and immediately commit to provide running water and safe waste water management into the Island Lake community, and will the minister tell us when 100% of first nation homes will have safe running water and waste water management?","Mr. Speaker, our government is strongly committed to the health and safety of all Canadians. \lineBreak We have made important and strategic infrastructure investments to support first nations in operating their water systems and have committed to introducing legislation to ensure first nations have the same safe water that all other Canadians have. \lineBreak We are working with Island Lake First Nations to address the needs of their community, including safe water."
1329,"Mr. Speaker, this is what the Quebec justice minister had to say about the Conservatives' approach to justice: “The solutions proposed by Bill  \lineBreak Are the Conservatives going to make Quebec pay against its will?","Mr. Speaker, what most of the people in Quebec and the rest of Canada want is a more effective justice system. They want us to crack down on dangerous criminals, ensure that the streets are safe and enhance security. Let us stop always debating and wanting to pit rehabilitation against deterrence. They go hand in hand. They are not mutually exclusive.  \lineBreak Now we have to fulfill our mandate of making our streets safer and we intend to do so through Bill "
1330,"Mr. Speaker, it is not only Quebec that is unhappy, but Ontario is unhappy as well with the Conservatives' plan to download the costs of its wrong-on-crime agenda to the provinces. \lineBreak To quote Premier McGuinty: \lineBreak Will the Conservatives come up with the money, or just download the costs of its prisons agenda onto the provinces?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. The opposition parties are demanding tougher laws for law-abiding farmers and duck hunters while opposing tougher penalties for violent criminals and rapists who prey on children. \lineBreak I hope that in her third question she will quote a third government, the Manitoba NDP government, which supports Bill "
1331,"Mr. Speaker, another province, British Columbia, is also unhappy and has raised concerns. \lineBreak With the Conservatives playing hide and seek on the costs, provinces like British Columbia do not even know how big the final bill will be.  \lineBreak British Columbia's solicitor general, Shirley Bond, said: \lineBreak How much will British Columbia have to pay to implement the Conservatives' prisons agenda?","Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility here. We have a clear mandate, and the majority of Canadians are seeking tougher penalties for violent criminals and rapists who prey on children. \lineBreak This is what we are doing. We are making laws more severe to ensure safety in our streets. To be more severe is not the opposite of rehabilitation; it is complementary. We should get out of these ideological debates."
1332,"Mr. Speaker, the message from the provinces to the government is clear. They are worried about being saddled with the costs of the Conservatives' wrong-headed prisons agenda that will not reduce crime. \lineBreak This out-of-touch government wants the provinces to foot the bill for more jails, more staff and more congestion in the courts. \lineBreak Where does the government expect the provinces to get the money, from health care and education? How many front-line police officers will be taken off the streets to pay for the Conservatives' megaprisons?","Mr. Speaker, it is very clear there are benefits to actually putting rapists and dangerous criminals behind bars. It means that ordinary Canadians are protected. \lineBreak I know that the opposition NDP would like to target duck hunters, sport shooters and farmers in my riding, but that will not bring the crime rate down. Targeting real criminals will."
1333,"Mr. Speaker, past transfers to the provinces will not help pay the billions in bills from the government's misguided prisons agenda. \lineBreak Experts have testified at committee that this bill will not actually improve public safety. The Canadian Bar Association's criminal justice section, made up of prosecutors and defence counsel, called the bill counterproductive, yet, the government is bullying provinces into writing a blank cheque with taxpayers' money. \lineBreak Will the government listen to the provinces and abandon its out-of-touch prisons agenda? When will it start helping provinces and communities invest in crime prevention and more front-line police officers?","Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to the member that he perhaps go to downtown Winnipeg and speak to members of his party, the NDP party, that holds government there, that supports Bill  \lineBreak It is willing to pay the cost and, furthermore, it does not want the long gun registry. It knows it is a waste of resources. It knows it detracts police from actually hunting down real criminals."
1334,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the government on the question that I think still preoccupies most Canadians, which is the economy.  \lineBreak We on this side of the House are finding it hard to understand why the government is still pursuing an ideological path when it actually has an opportunity to do something about two very direct issues which we have raised before. The first one is the increase in employment insurance premiums, which makes zero economic sense at the present time. The second is the failure to ensure that tax benefits and credits go to those Canadians who need them most. \lineBreak Why is the government having such a hard time addressing these two questions?","Mr. Speaker, the path that we are taking is working and we are following that path. Canada has created over 650,000 jobs, and the Liberals voted against it. We allowed income splitting for older people, and they voted against it.  \lineBreak We created measures to ensure the fees for EI premiums would not increase, and the Liberals voted against it. Now they are opposing the tax credit for hiring SMEs and, once again, they will vote against it."
1335,"Mr. Speaker, there is a $1.2 billion employment insurance premium increase at a time when the world economy is hitting a very heavy storm, and when Canadians and small businesses need help. I am asking the government to take off the ideological blinkers. Let the government see what needs to be done and let the government respond to what is a clear and compelling need of small business, workers and the people of Canada. That is what it is not responding to.","Mr. Speaker, let us talk about payroll taxes. Each time we have taken action to protect jobs, the Liberals have voted against it. Recently, we took steps to scale back the recommended increase in EI premiums and, once again, the Liberals are against them. They are making a fuss today, but when it comes time to vote and actually take real action that will affect all Canadian taxpayers, they are not shy about voting against such action. That is precisely what is so offensive and shameful."
1336,"Mr. Speaker, the government's crime legislation is misguided. It will cost taxpayers billions of dollars, but the government does not seem too concerned about that, because it is sending the bill to the provinces. Quebec has no intention of absorbing this undisclosed expense, and it is not the only province refusing to do so. This government is not even considering the provinces.  \lineBreak When will the government realize that its plan completely misses the mark?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has not taken into consideration the thoughts of the voters of this country, who gave us a mandate to crack down on crime. That being said, I understand the NDP position. Any money being spent to crack down on people in the long gun registry is okay, but its members draw the line when it goes after drug traffickers and child pornographers.  \lineBreak Canadians gave us a mandate to go after criminals in this country, and that is exactly what we are going to do."
1337,"Mr. Speaker, the provinces are right to refuse to cut their social services in order to fund megaprisons, especially when Canadians do not even know how much such a program will cost. The NDP has been saying from the beginning that this program will cost Canadians an absolute fortune without any certainty that it will have a real impact on reducing the crime rate. \lineBreak Will this government go back to the drawing board and consult the provinces to ensure that they are not penalized by such a misguided program?","Mr. Speaker, we have had extensive consultation with the provinces. They are all very aware of the pieces of legislation that we have put together. The administration of justice is, of course, the responsibility of the provinces.  \lineBreak That being said, I was very pleased when I saw in the last budget that there was an increase for the transfer to the provinces of $2.4 billion to allow them to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities. All of us should support that and take some comfort in that."
1338,"Mr. Speaker, B.C. has now joined the list of provinces upset about paying for the Conservatives' prison agenda. Provinces want to invest in front-line police officers so we can have safer communities. However, the government is shortchanging the provinces. We know who will pay for it, B.C. families. \lineBreak  Why will the government not let provinces like B.C. have a say in how they are going to spend their own money? When will the Conservatives finally reveal the full cost of their out-of-touch prison agenda?","Mr. Speaker, let me get this straight. We should spend more money on police officers so that they can catch bad guys, but we should not put them in prison. That is the fundamental flaw with the NDP philosophy. The members believe in talking tough as long as we do not do anything."
1339,"Order, please. The hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh.","Mr. Speaker, that is just so typical of that minister and that government. They do not understand—"
1340,"Order, please. The hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh has the floor.","Mr. Speaker, they have no concept of what front line police officers do in terms of preventing crime."
1341,"Order, please. As I said earlier this week, if members cannot come to order, they might find themselves short of questions. Order, please. \lineBreak The hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh.","Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are about to stick the provinces with a billion-plus dollars in bills for their prison agenda. Ontario has said “enough” and it is demanding that the Conservatives pay for their own prison agenda, not the provinces. They want front-line police officers--not more prisons, just front-line police officers. That is where the money should be spent.  \lineBreak The Conservatives do not understand. I do not understand the humour that is coming from that side of the House. \lineBreak However, if they are so hell-bent on ramming through this bill, will they at least listen to the three provinces that have come forward and said, “We're not paying the shot”6 Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia are not paying the shot. The government should pay the shot."
1342,"Mr. Speaker, I do respect my colleague opposite, but I know that he comes from a long and distinguished career of defending criminals as a defence criminal lawyer. Our perception is a little bit different.","Order, please. I know it is a Wednesday. We are barely a third of the way through the list. The hon. Minister of Public Safety has the floor and has a right to respond to the question. \lineBreak The hon. Minister of Public Safety."
1343,"Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, I understand the perspective that the member has, given his choice in career, and it is an honourable profession.  \lineBreak It is not the position, though, that our government takes. Our government takes a balanced approach. We want to ensure that victims are protected, that prisoners are--",The hon. member for Western Arctic.
1344,"Mr. Speaker, instead of a serious tendering process, we are stuck with a growing list of problems with the F-35s. The cost of the program has more than doubled, the F-35s have been defeated in combat simulations, communications equipment does not work and, worst of all, the pilots are not even safe. It is all very well for the government to say that it takes the safety of our troops seriously, but this fiasco shows the opposite. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, all the information provided by the member is false, absolutely false. \lineBreak What I continually cannot understand about the NDP is why it opposes getting the best equipment for our military, why it opposes the incredible benefits these purchases would bring to the entire country, including Quebec. I am completely baffled by the position taken by the NDP, which runs contrary to the wishes of the military and the aerospace industry."
1345,"Mr. Speaker, every day new problems with the F-35s come to light. Today, we have learned from an internal National Defence report that the F-35s are so expensive that we cannot afford enough aircraft to meet our needs. Consequently, there will be no room to manoeuvre in the event of the loss of any of the aircraft. This is in addition to concerns about their astronomical cost and their safety. \lineBreak When will the government stop denying the truth? When will the government finally announce an open and transparent bidding process?","Mr. Speaker, once again that is absolutely false. \lineBreak The Royal Canadian Air Force has clearly stated the number of aircraft it needs, which meets the right balance for its capabilities, as well as the balance in terms of the budget. \lineBreak We have seen time and time again that every time we have brought forward improvements for military personnel, whether it be improvements for the children of deceased veterans, whether it be improvements for their salaries, for their equipment, whether it is anything from the graveyard to the schoolyard, the NDP opposes it if it would improve things for the Canadian Forces."
1346,"Mr. Speaker, to date we have been urging the  \lineBreak Why 65 planes? Why a plane that does not work in the north? Why a stealth bomber designed to support ground troops? Why blow billions on the F-35?  \lineBreak When will the minister finally admit he has botched this file and hit the eject button on the F-35 program?","Mr. Speaker, the short answer is that is the number the air force asked for. It has clearly indicated that is the right balance. It has clearly indicated that this will allow our pilots in the air force to carry out the important work that we ask of them. \lineBreak Why is the NDP against giving the best equipment to the best pilots to the best air force? It would improve our aerospace and would bring jobs and prosperity to our economy in his province and across the country. The NDP's position on this is backward thinking."
1347,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak Today the papers are reporting that officials have known since December 15 that the Champlain Bridge was a safety hazard and that it could collapse. We could have expected officials at Transport Canada to get together as early as January 6 to find a solution. Instead, the government tried to cover its behind and have the blues pages handy to respond in case of a leak. \lineBreak What did this government hide? When will it tell the truth about the safety of the Champlain Bridge? We want to know.","Mr. Speaker, we have invested in maintaining this bridge in several budgets. Our government was happy to make an announcement recently, through the  \lineBreak I hope that we will have the support of the hon. member for these projects."
1348,"Mr. Speaker, I asked for a blueberry and got a lemon. I wanted to know what was going on. \lineBreak The problem is that a decision could have been made on January 6, but we had to wait until October to find out what was going on. Even people at Delcan are saying that it makes no sense and that the bridge could collapse. We have waited all this time and we do not know if the bridge will last another 10 years. \lineBreak Instead of having to one day appear before a commission of inquiry into the collapse of the Champlain Bridge, could the government table the inspection reports? People are crossing that bridge. Instead of hearing what the minister will say, we want to know whether the bridge is safe.","Mr. Speaker, our minister has demonstrated true leadership on this issue. We have made investments to maintain this bridge. The minister has announced a plan to replace the bridge. The Liberals never did that. \lineBreak We should focus on infrastructure and not on a Montreal member's campaign for mayor."
1349,"Mr. Speaker, experience with analyzing and assessing program spending to ensure real results are being delivered for Canadians, experience with risk methodology consistent with the Treasury Board Secretariat's integrated management framework. \lineBreak Those are some of the qualifications that were on the French-language job poster put out by the headhunting firm hired by the Conservatives to find a candidate for the position of Auditor General. \lineBreak My question is simple: how much were these headhunters paid?","Mr. Speaker, we have already said that the government looked for qualified candidates who were more or less bilingual. Upon completion of a rigorous process, the most qualified candidate was chosen. Again yesterday, Mr. Ferguson said that he wants to and will learn French. However, he has other skills that are important for this position."
1350,"Mr. Speaker, what I find interesting about this job posting is that the profile highlights do not mention proficiency in both official languages. There is nothing about that. Nada. Zip. Zero. Moreover, the Conservatives cannot tell us how much they paid the headhunters to put a unilingual job posting on their website. \lineBreak Why did the Conservatives not feel it necessary to find an Auditor General who is proficient in both languages, as defined by the government's criteria? \lineBreak And the job posting was in English only.","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ferguson is the most qualified candidate. He has said that he wants to and will learn French.  \lineBreak He is supported by the former auditor general, Madam Fraser. He is supported by those who have worked most closely with him. The Premier of New Brunswick and even the interim Liberal leader of New Brunswick have supported his candidacy because he is the most qualified for the position."
1351,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians saw for the first time today disturbing images from inside the notorious G20 detention centre. These makeshift cages held almost 900 people in crowded conditions with very little food, water or even a door on the toilet. \lineBreak  This was the largest mass arrest in Canadian history, and the majority of these people were never charged. A year and a half later Canadians are still waiting for answers and waiting for the government to accept responsibility. \lineBreak When will it conduct an inquiry into the G20 summit?","Mr. Speaker, if the member has specific knowledge of some wrongdoing by police officers in the course of executing their duty, it is his obligation to provide that to the provincial authorities that were in charge of that facility during that time."
1352,"Mr. Speaker, these are the kind of answers of which Canadians are getting tired. Toronto was turned upside down by this summit. While the Muskoka minister can find millions for his riding, small businesses in my community are still waiting for their compensation. \lineBreak When will the government properly compensate Toronto businesses and finally provide answers, not just to Toronto but to the entire country, about the G20 calamity?","Mr. Speaker, the losses and damages done to Toronto businesses are deeply regrettable. The claims process has been an independent process that has been in place since the previous government put it in place in 2001. It has been used successfully in previous summits.  \lineBreak In the spring I committed to having my office undertake a complete review of the claims process. Following that review, I can assure the member opposite that Toronto businesses were treated just as fairly as at every other previous summit."
1353,"Mr. Speaker, our government is squarely focused on what matters to Canadians: jobs and economic growth. I remind the NDP that in these challenging times there is simply no better job creator than free and open trade. That is why we are negotiating a free trade agreement with India that could help our economy grow by $6 billion a year and increase our two-way trade by almost 50%. \lineBreak Could the parliamentary secretary tell the House what our government is doing to further advance the job-creating pro-trade plan?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for  \lineBreak Today, as many members in the House know, already the  \lineBreak  Deepening Canada's trading relationship with India will help protect and strengthen the financial security of hard-working Canadians, and it is all part of our pro-trade free trade plan."
1354,"Mr. Speaker, national food banks yesterday reported that over 46% in Alberta and 63% in Saskatchewan of rural users are aboriginal. Ten per cent of all food bank users are first nations, Métis or Inuit. That represents a lot of aboriginal women and children. Many rural communities do not even have a food bank to turn to. To their credit, the Samson First Nation women have started a soup kitchen to fill the stomachs of those in need in their community. \lineBreak What happened to the government's commitment to end discrimination against Canada's aboriginal peoples and to ensure they also benefited from our economy?","Mr. Speaker, we are working with first nations like the Samson Cree Nation. What is important is that we provide the proper incentives to get people supporting good government, that there is economic development so they can look forward to jobs and prosperity and that we do the right things in terms of K to 12 education. Those are all things we are working on in a joint action plan with the national chiefs, and we have made much progress."
1355,"Mr. Speaker, I want to come back to Bill  \lineBreak Canada's crime rate keeps going down. It is a fact. Why does the government want to impose on Canadians the dumb-on-crime big jail agenda that has failed in the U.S.? \lineBreak It will have a huge cost and it shows a total disregard for our overtaxed justice system. Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia refuse to pay for this nonsense.  \lineBreak Will the government listen to them and replace Bill ","Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are doing, but then again, if the hon. member is in fact motivated by statistics, he might find it interesting to know that drug crimes are actually going up in this country and that sexual exploitation of children is going up in this country. \lineBreak If the statistics are what is motivating him, then he should be the first one on his feet to be supporting us on Bill "
1356,"Mr. Speaker, the government has a bizarre way of celebrating anniversaries. To honour the CBC's 75th anniversary, the government has decided to stage a witch hunt, led by the member for  \lineBreak Canadians are particularly concerned about the committee's decision to deliberate in secret behind closed doors.  \lineBreak My question is for the chairperson of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. Can she update the House on the status of the anti-CBC motion?","Mr. Speaker, incredibly, a majority of committee members voted to meet in camera at this time to deal with the business before the committee. This keeps our committee deliberations secret and effectively prevents committee members from commenting on the business before the committee. \lineBreak I know many members believe Canadians have a right to know, but I must report that the majority of members decided that the public will not be allowed to hear these debates."
1357,"Mr. Speaker, while the budget for the  \lineBreak Will the minister protect the legacy of our public broadcaster and invest in its future?","Yes, Mr. Speaker, we are demanding accountability at the CBC. For shame. \lineBreak For Canadians watching question period today, this is very instructive. The NDP started question period by saying we should not spend more money on fighting crime. Then it said we should not spend more money on the Canadian Forces so that they have the equipment they need. Now the NDP stands up and says, “However, let us give hundreds of millions more to the CBC”.  \lineBreak That tells us everything we need to know about that party versus where Canadians stand."
1358,"Mr. Speaker, Conservative job cuts continue in Atlantic Canada. \lineBreak First it was DFO, then Service Canada, then ACOA, and now it is Transport Canada. We found out Marine Atlantic has sold two ships to a company in India, when there was a Canadian company that could have bid to dismantle these ships right in Cape Breton. \lineBreak Not only have we lost 60 good-paying trade jobs, but this would also have been a great economic boost to a local industry. Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, in fact the government has invested over $520 million in Marine Atlantic and has improved the ferry service dramatically. It has been über-successful. \lineBreak  The other parties have voted against all our measures to improve Marine Atlantic service, which is a great boon for the economy and for the people and culture of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. \lineBreak Why do those members hate Nova Scotia and Newfoundland?"
1359,"Mr. Speaker, international scientists have asked that the cuts to ozone research be reversed. Thousands of Canadians have signed petitions. We have hosted a non-partisan breakfast on Parliament Hill on ozone research that has showed how important ozone research is, and Canada's leadership. \lineBreak Will the government unequivocally commit today that there will be absolutely no cuts to ozone research in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, as I have assured the House any number of times in recent weeks, Environment Canada will continue to monitor the ozone. The World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre will continue to deliver world-class services. \lineBreak This government makes no apologies whatsoever for trying to find the most cost-effective ways of protecting the Canadian environment."
1360,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned in the World Economic Forum report that Canadian women are still far from achieving pay equity. For every dollar earned by a man, a woman earns only 73¢. The gap is even greater when we are talking about aboriginal, immigrant or disabled women and mothers. Canada ranks 38th—behind Albania, Bahrain and Zimbabwe. Canada has been failing in this regard for decades.  \lineBreak When will the government acknowledge the pay equity problems in this country?","Mr. Speaker, we have an unparalleled record with respect to women's rights and making sure that the state has obligations in this area. We do not take a back seat to anybody with respect to that issue. \lineBreak We have certain recommendations in the future that we are pondering, but at this time we are proud of our record and we will continue on."
1361,"Mr. Speaker, last night our Conservative government passed the ending the long-gun registry act at second reading, which marks a significant milestone toward scrapping the long gun registry once and for all. \lineBreak Our Conservative government is strongly united behind this proposal. The NDP, many of whose members ran in the last election on ending the long gun registry, is showing some clear signs of disunity. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for his hard work on this file. \lineBreak I repeat that last night the second reading of the ending the long-gun registry act was historically passed by the House on a vote of 152-123, but again many members of the NDP who ran on ending the long gun registry listened to their Ottawa bosses rather than to the voices of their constituents. \lineBreak However, cracks in the NDP caucus showed up. Members from "
1362,"Mr. Speaker, to justify their ideological decision to destroy the firearms registry data, the Conservatives are prepared to do anything, even mislead the public. The  \lineBreak My question is simple: why is the government lying to the public?","Mr. Speaker, our government has introduced legislation to scrap the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all. Our legislation will destroy the records, which are inaccurate and unreliable and becoming increasingly so over time. \lineBreak I hope that the member has the decency to apologize; if not, I hope that you, Mr. Speaker, will take the appropriate steps for the unparliamentary language that the member used."
1363,"Mr. Speaker, clearly the process for appointing an Auditor General is seriously flawed. The government cannot announce in a job posting that a position requires proficiency in both official languages and then appoint someone who is not qualified based on the government's own requirements. This is an affront to the principles of natural justice. \lineBreak Will the government agree to postpone the vote until all the parties can come to an agreement on the appointment of the next Auditor General?","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ferguson was chosen on the basis of merit for his capabilities. He is very capable. He must speak French. He said he would learn to speak French. He is taking French lessons and he will speak French. Here is what Sheila Fraser said: \lineBreak 
								 \lineBreak The matter is therefore closed."
1364,"Mr. Speaker, the problem with his policy is that it does not protect victims; it creates victims. The government concealed the fact that it wanted to destroy the firearms registry's database. This is a brutal act that has been widely condemned. The Government of Quebec wants to preserve the data in order to ensure the safety of police officers and the public, and the federal Privacy Commissioner considers that justified. Since the Conservatives are failing in their duty, at the very least, they must stop standing in the way and allow the Quebec government to use the data.  \lineBreak If the Conservatives do not want to lead, will they at least get out of the way?","Mr. Speaker, for years that member's government was busy targeting law-abiding hunters, farmers and sport shooters and treating them as criminals. \lineBreak We have consistently opposed this wasteful and ineffective measure, which does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. \lineBreak Our government received a strong mandate from Canadians in order to ensure that we end the long gun registry and actually stand up for victims against real criminals."
1365,"Mr. Speaker, food banks are an important service provided for our communities. \lineBreak In my riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, a church was vandalized this week, and the thieves even robbed the food bank. Unfortunately, too many families with young children depend on that food bank. This is devastating for them, and completely unacceptable. \lineBreak When will the government really do something to tackle poverty among young people, so that families will not be so vulnerable?","Mr. Speaker, the best way to fight poverty in Canada is to get Canadians working. \lineBreak The economic action plan is doing just that, growing the economy by 650,000 net new jobs since July 2009. \lineBreak Whether it be the working income tax benefit that has helped low-income Canadians over the welfare wall or the unprecedented investments in training, this government has a plan. Why is the NDP member not voting for it? "

It is that member who yesterday launched a full frontal attack on the integrity and credibility of a member of the Supreme Court of Canada, fabricating commitments at a confidential hearing which were never made. That member has been repudiated by Mr. Justice Rothstein. Will he stand in his place, apologize and retract his irresponsible remarks?"
1367,"Order, order. The hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh.","I will just ignore that, Mr. Speaker. \lineBreak The Conservatives' imprisonment plan is the wrong approach. It ignores the concerns of local stakeholders who, for decades, have been fighting crime, working to rehabilitate young people and keeping our communities safe. The Government of Quebec was very clear: if Ottawa passes this bill, it should not count on Quebec to pay the bill.  \lineBreak When will the Conservatives finally work with Quebec to combat crime?"
1368,"Mr. Speaker, the NDP will continue to ignore the victims of crime. \lineBreak For example, the New Brunswick Attorney General said that her government supports, without hesitation, the efforts to strengthen these legislative provisions in order to protect victims of crime, protect our children and give victims a voice.  \lineBreak However, the hon. member cannot ignore his attack on the credibility of a member of the Supreme Court of Canada. Will the hon. member apologize and retract his irresponsible remarks with regard to the integrity of Mr. Justice Rothstein?","Mr. Speaker, I will continue to ignore that. \lineBreak It is not just the province of Quebec that is opposed to these costs. \lineBreak  Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island have also made it clear that they oppose the government's expectation that they will bear the costs related to this program. In all, that is over 75% of the country's population. \lineBreak Why is this government ignoring the opinions of these provinces? What does the government plan to do if the provinces simply refuse to pay the bill?"
1369,"Mr. Speaker, this government will continue to act in the interest of crime victims and Canadians, just as it is acting in the interest of the 77% of Quebeckers who said that they were in favour of tougher sentences for criminals. \lineBreak However, for the third time, I will give the hon. member the opportunity to retract his irresponsible remarks that attack the integrity of a member of the Supreme Court. We must respond to this member's false statements. \lineBreak When will he apologize for attacking the integrity and credibility of a justice of the Supreme Court?","Mr. Speaker, after hearing yesterday's scandalous personal attack on my New Democratic colleague by the  \lineBreak Newfoundland and Labrador's justice minister said he has never seen a study favouring more jail time as a way to improve public safety.  \lineBreak Why will the out of touch government not support the provinces' efforts to invest in crime prevention and more police officers? Why is it burdening them with billions more in costs for a failed approach?"

Newfoundland and Labrador's justice minister said that past social transfers are not sufficient to cover the costs of these megaprisons. Premier Ghiz in P.E.I. said that if the federal government wants to increase costs for the provinces, it should pay the bill.  \lineBreak Provinces are refusing to write a blank cheque for the government's prisons agenda. Will the government help the provinces pay for crime prevention, or will it bully them into paying for a plan that has been a proven failure elsewhere?"
1371,"Mr. Speaker, let us be clear with respect to the NDP. Even spending a dollar on fighting crime would be too much for the members of the NDP. \lineBreak That being said, with respect to the provinces, I see the province of Manitoba, through its attorney general, said, “Because we called for many of the things that are in there”, he is talking about the bill, “we're hoping that the law gets passed and we can get on with it"". Marie-Claude Blais, the attorney general of New Brunswick, said, “This bill will help to better protect our children”. \lineBreak Why will the New Democrats not get with it and start helping us to fight crime in this country for a change? When are they going to get—",The hon. member for Toronto Centre.
1372,"Mr. Speaker, Europe has been rocked by the threat of an economic disaster that could have significant repercussions in countries everywhere, including Canada. Canadians are afraid of losing their jobs, a record number of families are turning to food banks and there are record levels of inequality. Almost two million people are unemployed, but there is no real plan to create jobs that will sustain the economy. \lineBreak My question is simple: when will this government finally take action to help these Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, as we have said over and over, we have a plan. The NDP voted against our plan. This plan will help the economy and our Canadian families. I am referring to phase two of Canada's economic action plan. I wonder why the NDP is refusing to vote with us to create jobs. We have created 650,000 jobs since July 2009."
1373,"Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that slow growth means fewer jobs for Canadians. Yesterday, the Parliamentary Budget Officer said we should expect another 100,000 Canadians to lose their jobs next year. The Governor of the Bank of Canada said that the economy is slowing. These are individuals with more credibility than the government has. \lineBreak The Conservatives are clearly taking Canada down the wrong track. When will the government admit it does not have a plan, adopt the sound economic suggestions of this side of the House, through the NDP, and act now to protect family-supporting jobs to avoid 100,000 more unemployed people?","Mr. Speaker, I was at that meeting yesterday. I heard very clearly what the PBO had to say. I heard very clearly the other day what the Governor of the Bank of Canada had to say. It was very clear that the PBO said that he makes mistakes. Why did he say that? There was a report in  \lineBreak We are going to stick with our low-tax agenda. We are going to help families. Whether or not those members vote for it, we are going to do the right thing."
1374,"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about mistakes. From May 2008 to today, the Conservatives have created barely 250,000 jobs in this country. It is not the numbers they advance, not the bogus mistakes that they put forward. \lineBreak Before the Conservatives start to celebrate, the reality is that over the same period of time, the labour market grew by 450,000 jobs. This means they are 200,000 jobs short from treading water, from standing still. That is very unfortunate for Canadian families. \lineBreak Given that their numbers are bogus, given that they are going to lose another 100,000 jobs if they do not act, why do the Conservatives not get to work now so that Canadians can get back to work?","Mr. Speaker, what we have to resist is that $10 billion tax hike the NDP has proposed that would kill jobs, that would negatively impact Canadian families. Let us not forget that the IMF and the OECD have been very clear that this is and will be the country in the next five years in the world to do business. \lineBreak We are going to continue with the plan we have because that is giving us the advantage in the world. That is going to help Canadian families. We are not going to succumb to the punishment of the NDP on our Canadian families by voting for higher taxes and killing jobs."
1375,"Mr. Speaker, families are finding it harder to get ahead. Household debt is the highest it has ever been. The average Canadian family owes $1.49 for every dollar it earns. \lineBreak The Conservatives have no plan. When will we see measures from the government that will help struggling Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, we clearly are concerned about Canadians overextending themselves. However, I have to ask myself, and I ask the NDP to respond to this eventually, why is that when we put as a priority of our government things like the financial literacy plan where we are setting up a financial literacy leader in the government to improve that situation, when we introduce credit card reforms, when we strengthen mortgage rules to protect Canadians who are buying a home and when we cut taxes and create things like the TFSA, which is an incredible advantage to Canadians, the NDP always votes against them?"
1376,"Mr. Speaker, the truth is we voted against billions in corporate tax cuts. We voted against the inaction of the government. \lineBreak Household debt has reached record levels and families continue to pay the price. \lineBreak The problem is that instead of helping households make ends meet, the Conservative government continues to give large tax cuts to big business, which does not really create jobs. If that is their plan, it just does not work. \lineBreak When will this government finally help families crushed by debt?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, our government's priority is primarily to meet the needs of our Canadian families. For that reason, we are anxiously watching current world events. We are hearing more and more that events affecting Europe and the United States may affect us also. \lineBreak That is why we must continue with our plan to freeze taxes for families and maintain jobs. To that end, we must follow our plan to help employers create jobs for Canadian families."
1377,"Mr. Speaker, just yesterday there were reports calling for the government to compromise on Canadian rights by backing down from our legitimate WTO challenge that seeks trade fairness for fishermen. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, it really is disappointing that the only Liberal spokesperson we have heard from recently is a Toronto senator who opposes the seal hunt. \lineBreak We are a little worried about the NDP members as well, because their self-appointed Newfoundland fisheries critic claimed that the seal hunt is doomed and has said that we would be better off if commercial hunters retreated. \lineBreak In the face of this affront to our fishermen and sealers, we stand emboldened in our resolve to defend Canada's international trade rights."
1378,"Mr. Speaker, according to the annual Corrections report, under the government's watch, things are getting worse in Canadian prisons. Our prisons are more crowded than ever. Offenders with mental health problems are simply put in solitary confinement with no access to treatment programs. \lineBreak Conservative mismanagement is putting Corrections staff at risk and leading to more violence in our prisons. \lineBreak When will the government stop with these photo ops and actually address these serious public safety concerns?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. Part of that means assuring that offenders are rehabilitated when in prison. That is why we have made historic investments, improving mental health in the correctional system. \lineBreak  In fact, I am proud to note that the International Corrections and Prison Association recognize this work with its leadership award for Canadian Corrections."
1379,"Mr. Speaker, all we hear from this government is rhetoric, with no regard for the facts. Here are the facts: access to rehabilitation programs is key to helping ex-convicts reintegrate into society. Yet these programs represent only 1.8% of the total budget of Correctional Service Canada. \lineBreak Why does this government refuse to make public safety a priority by ensuring that prisoners have access to rehabilitation programs?","Mr. Speaker, I would invite the member to receive a briefing from Correctional Service Canada to indicate the steps that we have been taking, concrete steps on the issue of mental health in prisons. Both access to treatment services for inmates and access to training for staff have been vastly improved under this government.  \lineBreak I must point out that these increased resources are a result of the strong leadership of our "
1380,"Mr. Speaker, with the world economy in turmoil, it is no time for complacency. Standards of living are flat, disposable incomes are stagnant, household debt is high and the gulf between the very wealthy and everyone else is widening.  \lineBreak To make Canadians less vulnerable and to encourage growth, will the government forgo its $1.2 billion EI payroll tax increase, allow 10 million low-income Canadians to access tax credits now reserved for only the better off and help seniors whose RSPs have been devastated in the stock market? Will the government do those three sensible things?","Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge that we are cautiously optimistic with the news coming out of Europe. However, it is interesting to find the Liberal Party standing up and talking about tax credits and helping people like our seniors and our most vulnerable. When we talk about our volunteer firefighters tax credit, I remember firefighters begging the Liberal Party, when it was in government, to do something, and it did absolutely nothing, so I will take no lessons from the Liberals on how to improve a credit they denied them for years."

1382,"Mr. Speaker, on the government's watch, job creation is declining quarter after quarter. According to leading economists, the few jobs being created are almost all low-paying, part-time, or temporary. In fact, today Canada still has over half a million fewer full-time jobs compared to August 2008.  \lineBreak Given this sad situation, why is the government hurting private sector job creation with a whopping EI payroll tax increase, an almost $2 billion burden in the last two years?","Mr. Speaker, I found it interesting when the member mentioned raising taxes. Was it not the Liberal Party, in its platform, that wanted to put a carbon tax on everyone--all Canadians, vulnerable or not? \lineBreak That said, let us give the facts and the accurate statistics. Statistics Canada's facts are clear: 650,000 net new jobs have been created since July 2009, 90% of those have been full-time jobs, and 80% of them are in the private sector. This is a wonderful story, and we are going to tell it again and again."
1383,"Mr. Speaker, this morning, by approving the appointment of a unilingual auditor general, the Conservatives once again showed their contempt for bilingualism. They ignored all the concerns raised by the NDP and francophones across the country. Although the government claims that Mr. Ferguson was the most qualified candidate, he does not speak French. How will he be able to do his job? \lineBreak Will the Auditor General conduct investigations only in English and ignore all the French documentation?","Mr. Speaker, as we have already said, the government looked for bilingual candidates. I said that yesterday. Upon completion of a very rigorous process, the most qualified candidate was chosen. Mr. Ferguson told a House committee and the Senate that it is important to learn French, that he wants to learn French and that he is going to learn French."

Yet, the job posting in the  \lineBreak Why is the government still trying to suggest that the appointment was based on merit and that the candidate selected was the most qualified? The candidate does not even meet one of the hiring criteria. Is this what bilingualism means to the Conservatives?","Mr. Speaker, I absolutely reject the premise of that question. The person who chose to be considered for this position is absolutely the most qualified. This individual was given a battery of questions and tests. Sheila Fraser, the former auditor general, has endorsed his candidacy. Others who have been involved with him in the New Brunswick legislature have endorsed him, including the opposition Liberal leader.  \lineBreak He is the best candidate, and we stand by this appointment."

They suggest that the cuts will be absorbed through attrition, which is false, and by calculating the mortality rate of veterans, which is offensive. The ombudsman says that new vets are outpacing the death rate of older vets.  \lineBreak No one believes the minister except the echo chamber around him. When will Conservatives stop their assault on veterans and exempt the department from cuts?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is out in left field—a potato field, I suppose—because the echo that is reverberating from one end of the country to the other indicates that our government has made a variety of improvements over the past six years: it introduced the new veterans charter, set up the Office of the Veterans Ombudsman and resolved the agent orange issue. Never have we invested so much in our veterans and we will continue to do so because we love our veterans and we believe in them. "

There was not a single case of confirmed ISA in B.C. \lineBreak At this time, the reported findings to which the member refers are not conclusive.

We feel the need to actually get things done here and deliver on our commitments.  \lineBreak In fact, in each of these cases since we started in September, each one of those bills continues to be debated in the process in the House of Commons. At committee, they have not even returned here for report stage yet, let alone third reading.

We have completely accepted that advice. \lineBreak Yesterday there were two hours' worth of hearings on the issue where every question was answered."
1400,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General said the rules were broken and the rules were broken by him.

1403,"Mr. Speaker, New Democrats have been pointing out daily that the Conservatives have no jobs plan. With the devastating job loss numbers announced today, maybe now the government will finally listen. Unemployment is once again on the rise. Canada lost 72,000 jobs in October alone, most of them from the high-value-added manufacturing sector. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives change their course of action and make job creation the priority? Where is the plan?","Mr. Speaker, job creation and economic growth have been and will continue to be our number one priority as a government.  \lineBreak We are pleased with the 600,000 jobs that have been created since the bottom of the recession in July 2009, but we deeply sympathize with anyone who lost their job this past month. As we have said all along, Canada is not immune from the global economic turbulence in the United States and Europe, but the House can be assured that this government will maintain its focus on jobs and economic growth."
1404,"Mr. Speaker, just like its jobs plan, that answer does not cut it.  \lineBreak The 72,000 Canadians who lost their jobs last month know that the government has abandoned them. There are almost 300,000 more unemployed Canadians today than in July 2008, and that was just before the recession that the government could not even see coming. \lineBreak What is the Conservatives' message for those out-of-work Canadians and their families? Is it, “Just wait for the next corporate tax cuts and all will be well”? It has not worked and it will not work. People need to go  back to work now.","Mr. Speaker, job creation and economic growth are the centrepiece of the next phase of Canada's economic action plan.  \lineBreak Right now before the House, we have an important measure to help protect and create jobs such as the hiring credit for small business. What we need is for the New Democratic Party to stand up and support that initiative, to support small business, to support the economic engine of our economy.  \lineBreak We will remain focused on job creation. When will the NDP stand up and support that initiative to help our small businesses?"
1405,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative numbers are clearly bogus. The government can play with statistics as much as it wants in order to mask its failure, but the reality is that the unemployment rate rose in October: 72,000 full-time jobs were lost. \lineBreak Can the Conservatives stop pretending? The government's economic inaction plan is not creating jobs; it is creating victims. What will the government do about the 72,000 full-time jobs that were lost? Will it replace them with 18,000 part-time jobs and declare a victory?","Mr. Speaker, our priority is job creation and economic growth. We will continue to work on our economic action plan. We have created 600,000 jobs in the past two years, but we will continue to work harder to grow the economy and create jobs. That is the real priority for Canadians and for our government."
1406,"Mr. Speaker, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Conservatives, by toying with the process and appointing an anglophone auditor general, have violated one of our country's basic values. When the job posting states that proficiency in French and English is an essential hiring condition for the position of Auditor General, it does not meant that bilingualism is an asset qualification; it is an immutable condition. It is part of the qualifications. If the candidate is not bilingual, then the candidate should not be offered the job. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, we chose the best candidate who applied for the position of Auditor General.

1407,"Mr. Speaker, this tainted process is now affecting the Office of the Auditor General of Canada. I have just learned that Michel Dorais, who is one of the independent members of the audit committee and has been a senior public servant for over 30 years, has just resigned, stating that he cannot “continue to serve...while accepting that the incoming auditor general does not meet an essential requirement for the position.” Michel Dorais has spent his entire career fighting for bilingualism in the public service.  \lineBreak What are the Conservatives waiting for to show respect for all Canadians and for Michel Dorais as a bilingual individual?","Mr. Speaker, this government strongly supports the official languages of this great country. We are pleased that the best candidate for the job has agreed to learn French.  \lineBreak What is interesting is the double standard of the Liberal Party. When the last Liberal prime minister, Paul Martin, appointed a unilingual anglophone as his finance minister,  was that member standing to complain? No. He was standing right behind that decision. If it is good enough for a minister of finance to be unilingually English, why is it not good enough for the best candidate to be appointed as Auditor General and who has committed to learning French?"
1408,"Mr. Speaker, we do not want an auditor general for the government; we want an auditor general for Parliament and for all Canadians. \lineBreak Now we learn that one of the two independent members of the AG internal audit committee, a distinguished ex-deputy minister of over 30 years, Michel Dorais, submitted his resignation this morning. Why? It is because for him bilingualism was no longer an issue of convenience or communication but a question of competency.  \lineBreak I have his letter in my hand. Let us have no more excuses. What must be done is to make the ","Mr. Speaker, we have a new Auditor General, someone who embraces our official languages, someone who has committed to learning French, which is tremendously important. \lineBreak Eighty per cent of Canadians do not have bilingual qualifications. There is a role for them. This individual has committed to learning French, but, again, this is one rule for the public service and another rule for the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party was quite happy to have a unilingual anglophone who did not speak French, despite serving in Parliament for 30 years, and yet it puts another rule on everyone else. Is there one rule for the Liberal Party and another rule for Canadians?"
1409,"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to meeting with shady businessmen, Canadians expect more from cabinet ministers and expect good judgment from all of us in the House today. \lineBreak However, the  \lineBreak Will the minister of state stop stonewalling and please tell Canadians what his role was in this fiasco?","Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that if anybody has any information suggesting that any law has been broken, they should bring that forward; otherwise, they should resist the temptation to simply make smears, such as the opposition member wishes to do right now."
1410,"Mr. Speaker, we see corruption at the CRA, a cabinet minister carousing with accused gun smugglers and stonewalling on their G8 slush fund. It has not been a good week for Conservatives. In fact, as one newspaper editorial put it this week, “Is the Prime Minister getting a queasy feeling? He should be. This isn't pretty”. How true. \lineBreak On Wednesday, the Muskoka minister failed to answer questions at committee and flailed around while he was there. However, he did promise one thing. He promised to send an evaluation of his pork-barrel projects. \lineBreak  Will the minister table those documents today?","Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak The Auditor General has confirmed that all money was spent appropriately. Every dollar has been accounted for, and all the money that was spent was on public infrastructure."
1411,"Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, not only was the  \lineBreak The person who controls our country's spending must keep his promises. When will we see these documents?","Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak The government works very hard to ensure that every dollar goes towards public projects, projects for municipalities and provincial infrastructure projects and every dollar went to those needs."
1412,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Canadians have a right to know, and this government has a duty to be transparent. When will we finally get the truth?","Mr. Speaker, before committee, all the questions were given responses.  \lineBreak With respect to the 32 projects that received funding, all of them were evaluated by public servants of Infrastructure Canada who deemed that every one of those projects were eligible under the criteria established before the program. Each one of those 32 projects had a contribution agreement that was prepared by the public service and signed off by the relevant authorities. \lineBreak The reality is that the "
1413,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the government quietly revealed that it will spend more than $800 million on AECL this year alone.  \lineBreak Many people may say that massive overspending on the nuclear crown corporation is par for the course for the government, but what is different this time is that it has already sold most of the business to a private company. \lineBreak Why is the minister hanging taxpayers out to dry while subsidizing privatized nuclear power?","Mr. Speaker, the reason that we have sold this to a strong private sector partner is precisely for that reason. We agree that AECL is costing taxpayers too much money, and that is why we moved ahead. \lineBreak Actually, if the NDP had its way, there would not be a nuclear job in this country. It would cost Canadians 30,000 jobs. \lineBreak We are moving ahead, protecting taxpayers and protecting industry at the same time."
1414,"Mr. Speaker, the government has botched the sale of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. Furthermore, it was not transparent about the process,  and we are now seeing the results. We have learned that the sale of the CANDU reactor division has cost $280 million and that the return on investment was only $15 million. That is a net loss of $265 million for Canadians, who had already paid $21 billion to support Atomic Energy of Canada Limited ever since it was created. \lineBreak Starting in 2012, will this government stop running Canada's energy resources at a loss?","Mr. Speaker, our government is taking a responsible approach. We are protecting taxpayers' interests while ensuring the future of the nuclear industry in Canada. \lineBreak My colleague mentioned that there are 2,000 jobs in Mississauga alone that are connected to the nuclear industry. We are proud to protect those jobs. The NDP keeps talking about jobs for Canadians. We are protecting those jobs. \lineBreak In this transition, I need to point out that the costs are actually lower than they were initially estimated to be. We have saved hundreds of Canadian jobs through doing that. \lineBreak As the member mentioned, the costs associated with this divestiture are well known to the public."
1415,"Mr. Speaker, late last night, the heavy hand of the state came smashing down to destroy a great Canadian institution. It was a sham, it was a travesty and it would surely offend the sensibilities of anybody who would call themselves a democrat. \lineBreak All that is left now is to pay for the minister's ideological zeal to kneecap the Canadian Wheat Board. With no money for social programs, no money for affordable housing and no money for the environment, where will the government find $500 million to live out the fantasy of that minister's obsession to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board?","Mr. Speaker, is it just me or is there a bit of irony in the fact that the member opposite wants to legalize marijuana but criminalize grain?  \lineBreak I also need to point out that we did meet last night,  and one of the amendments that the NDP wanted to bring forward, which the Liberals supported, would actually have jailed farmers again. We were not prepared to go there. \lineBreak Farmers woke up this morning thrilled to finally hear that Bill "
1416,"Mr. Speaker, my question is quite straightforward. Why did the Conservative government not follow the example set by its own leader, the current ","Mr. Speaker, as I am sure the hon. member is well aware, there is no language requirement in the Auditor General Act, which is the act that governs the Auditor General. \lineBreak Regardless of that, we did search out bilingual candidates. However, at the end of the day, when looking at all of the different merits of the candidates, we chose the person who was the most meritorious, which is what one must do in a position like this. We stand by that appointment. \lineBreak Mr. Ferguson has already promised to learn French and wants to learn French. The hon. member should give him the benefit of the doubt."
1417,"Mr. Speaker, a few days ago I asked the government if it realized that it was opening Pandora's box by failing to observe its own selection criteria for the next Auditor General. This morning, we caught a glimpse of the first repercussions of their stubbornness: the Commissioner of Official Languages, the President of the Public Service Commission of Canada, all opposition parties and a Conservative senator are opposed and now a member of the Auditor General's internal audit committee has resigned.  \lineBreak Is it not time to stop this stubbornness?","Mr. Speaker, I have already said that we picked the most qualified candidate, a candidate who wants to learn French and who will do so. He is a candidate who can do the job on behalf of Canadians. We support this candidate, and the Liberals should support him as well. "
1418,"Mr. Speaker, over 71,000 Canadians lost their full-time jobs just last month. We now have 600,000 fewer full-time jobs than in August of 2008. \lineBreak Doug Porter of BMO said that “losses of this magnitude are extremely rare, aside from recessionary periods”. \lineBreak Scotiabank said, “The magnitude and breadth of the decline is disconcerting here”. \lineBreak This is a jobless recovery and a human recession. When will the Conservatives invest in a real plan to create jobs and help Canadians get back to work?","Mr. Speaker, again, we sympathize with all Canadians who lost their jobs. However, I have to note that Canada is in a very good position when we compare it to other countries across the world. In fact, we have been saying for over a year that we are not immune to outside pressures like what is going on in Europe at this point. \lineBreak The IMF and the OECD said that we would be the fastest-growing G7 economy in the next couple of years. A Reuters poll of 350 economists also said very recently, “Canada should see some of the strongest rates of growth compared with its G7 peers this year and next”."
1419,"Mr. Speaker, the government has once again shown its contempt for Canadian francophones by choosing an auditor general who does not meet the job criteria in the government's own posting. \lineBreak When the hon. member for  \lineBreak This morning we learned that the taxpayers spent $150,000 on finding someone who does not have all the necessary qualifications. How do the Conservatives justify this waste?","Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, we looked for the most qualified candidate who has the right skills for this position. The candidate went through a very rigorous process and said in this House and in the Senate that it is important to learn French, that he wants to learn French and that he is going to learn French."
1420,"Mr. Speaker, even the good friend of the Prime Minister's former director of communications—yes, he who was able to speak both official languages—Conservative Senator Housakos, is against the appointment of this Auditor General. There is no end to the problems with this appointment process: the headhunters did not post the job posting in French; $150,000 was wasted; and the Commissioner of Official Languages is going to investigate the matter. Confusion reigns in the Conservative ranks because the process was flawed. \lineBreak The Auditor General has promised to learn French within a year. What are francophones supposed to do in the meantime?","Mr. Speaker, as we have said, he has already started to learn French. He has the support of Sheila Fraser, the former Auditor General. \lineBreak The interim Liberal leader in the province of New Brunswick supports this appointment as well, as someone who is in the opposition but still supports the appointment. He knows Mr. Ferguson very well. He has worked with him. Mr. Ferguson has the qualifications to be an excellent candidate for Auditor General. I encourage the hon. member to think the same way as reasonable people do."
1421,"Mr. Speaker, Quebec's National Assembly unanimously agreed that the government should keep the gun registry data. The government is accountable to the chiefs of police who use it thousands of times a day, to victims of crime and to Quebec taxpayers, who have already paid for this registry. \lineBreak Why is this government refusing to side with victims and give this data to the provinces?","Mr. Speaker, the data contained in the long gun registry are incomplete. The data are flawed and are increasingly more flawed and incomplete. We have committed to Canadians that we will end the long gun registry, and that means destroying the data. \lineBreak I am disappointed in the NDP for penalizing its MPs from the Thunder Bay area for supporting their constituents and voting to end the long gun registry. I hope that will change as the bill goes forward."
1422,"Mr. Speaker, that is not an acceptable answer for the victims of the shooting at the École Polytechnique or for victims of other shootings. The gun registry is essential to public safety. The provinces and chiefs of police have said it over and over. They use the registry every day, yet this government is willing to get rid of the data in the registry for no good reason. \lineBreak Will the government reverse its reckless decision so that we can avoid another shooting like the one at the École Polytechnique?","Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we are very proud to have 11 active police officers and former police officers in our party. We listen to police officers. That is why we have given provisions, for example in Bill "
1423,"Mr. Speaker, the list of problems with the catastrophic F-35 program just keeps on growing. The safety of our pilots is compromised, costs are skyrocketing, the planes do not meet our needs and they cost so much that we cannot buy as many as we need. \lineBreak My question is simple. How can a plane that is slower than the one it is replacing, that could injure or even kill our pilots, and that we cannot communicate with in the Canadian north actually be the best for our troops?","Mr. Speaker, the extensive and rigorous competition has taken place. Two airplanes squared off, and the F-35 won the competition. That is the best aircraft for our men and women well into the future and to ensure that our sovereignty is maintained in the future, as well."
1424,"Mr. Speaker, the procurement tailspin continues. \lineBreak Now we learn our pilots will not even be able to learn how to fly the F-35s in Canada. According to DND documents, pilot training will have to be moved from Cold Lake, Alberta to a facility in Florida run by Lockheed Martin. \lineBreak The government is throwing billions at a plane that cannot fly here for pilots who cannot train here. Why is the government buying planes that take training jobs out of Canadian cities? Why is it abandoning Cold Lake?","Mr. Speaker, the member should know that in order to get traction, he should have his facts straight. \lineBreak Long-term training on the F-35s will take place in Canada, just as currently is done with the CF-18s. It is reasonable that Canadians will do initial training with those from whom we purchase the aircraft, which has always been the case. \lineBreak We will ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment and the best training to do their job safely and effectively."
1425,"Mr. Speaker, the number of troubling revelations about the Canada Revenue Agency is growing. We are talking about an extortion scheme and bribes paid by entrepreneurs in exchange for substantial tax reductions. The RCMP's investigation into this corruption, which was focusing on the Montreal office, has now been expanded to include other Quebec offices.  \lineBreak Can the government confirm the news and tell us what measures it has taken to tighten controls at the Canada Revenue Agency?","Mr. Speaker, the government appreciates that these are very serious allegations. An RCMP investigation into this matter is ongoing, and CRA officials are co-operating fully. Many of these allegations date back more than a decade, and some of these cases are currently making their way through the courts.  \lineBreak The integrity of our tax system is very important to all Canadians and we will take all steps necessary to ensure it is protected."
1426,"Mr. Speaker, the corruption investigation started in the Montreal office and now has spread. Other Quebec offices are under investigation. The growing scope of this investigation is raising questions about the state of the CRA as a whole. Canadians expect this agency to operate with impeccable integrity.  \lineBreak Conservatives need to clear the air about these troubling corruption allegations. Can the government tell us if it has asked for an investigation all across Canada? What is it doing to restore the confidence of Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, we absolutely agree that the integrity of our tax system is important to all Canadians. Our government will take any steps necessary to ensure it is protected. An RCMP investigation into these matters is ongoing,  and CRA officials are co-operating fully."
1427,"Mr. Speaker, Marine Atlantic sold two ferries on the condition that they would be broken down ethically. Instead, these boats wound up in Alang, India, which is one of the most dangerous shipyards in the world. It is known for its environmental and human rights violations. Last year around 27 workers were killed in the shipyard alone. \lineBreak We are shipping dangerous asbestos overseas, and we are disposing of our waste with no regard for human safety. My question is, how could the government let this happen?","Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to supporting Marine Atlantic. \lineBreak We are investing $500 million to help Marine Atlantic renew its fleet and shore facilities. As a crown corporation, Marine Atlantic is arm's-length from the Government of Canada and is responsible for the management of its own operations. \lineBreak The disposal of the MV "
1428,"Mr. Speaker, why are we sending our ships to be destroyed in such a hazardous environment when we have some of the world's finest shipyards here in Canada? \lineBreak The government is literally shipping our jobs overseas, and has no regard for human safety and the environment. We know that the Alang shipyard employs children. We know it breaks up the ships on the beach. These ships are probably filled with asbestos. \lineBreak This is not the kind of Canada we want. Why is the government letting good jobs leave Canada to be completed in one of the world's deadliest shipyards?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know why the hon. member wants the Government of Canada, politicians, to interfere in the daily operational decisions of Marine Atlantic, which is an arm's-length crown corporation. I do not know if she wants to politicize what should be an arm's-length group. \lineBreak The disposal of the MV  \lineBreak  Our government is committed to supporting Marine Atlantic. We are committed to renewing its fleet and its shore facilities. We ask that the NDP finally come around to supporting us in our work on that."
1429,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak We know that for years the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources has run a campaign of hate against the Canadian Wheat Board, the very board he took a solemn oath to uphold. That is one thing, but why does the minister himself betray the facts, even misinform committee? He stated before committee, “They've”, meaning the board, “always said 'now is not a good time. The directors don't really want to hear from you'.” \lineBreak I have had three invitations from the board over three years. Why does the minister not tell the facts?","Mr. Speaker, I was very disappointed earlier this month. The minister was going to Russia. He had been asked to attend a board meeting. I think the board knew he was going to be away when it sent the invitation. He responded by saying that his parliamentary secretary would be very glad to attend the board meeting. I was very disappointed because the board said it did not want to meet with me. \lineBreak We have finally come forward with Bill "
1430,"Mr. Speaker, last week TD Bank became the second major Canadian bank to quit using the independent banking ombudsman, and we have heard nothing from the government. The ombudsman is there to stand up for the everyday consumer against the big banks. It protects families when banks make errors in dealing with their accounts. \lineBreak If the government is not standing up for everyday consumers, then who is?","Mr. Speaker, currently all banks are required to have consumer complaints procedures in place and have a third-party dispute-handling body. However, there is a variation in procedures used, and this is a concern for us and consumers.  \lineBreak To better protect consumers, we are forcing banks to belong to government-approved independent third-party bodies. We are establishing uniform regulatory standards for internal complaints procedures. We are giving the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada the authority to monitor and enforce compliance. We have passed legislation for this and are now finalizing regulations.  \lineBreak Unfortunately, the NDP voted against all of it."
1431,"Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of talk there, but not much of an answer, especially for families who are tired of being treated unfairly by the big banks.  \lineBreak By doing nothing, the government is giving the banks a get-out-of-jail-free card on consumer protection. Overseas, our finance minister sings the virtues of Canada's strong banking regulations, while he lets them slide here at home. \lineBreak Why will the government not stand up for Canadian families instead of giving the big banks a free pass?","Mr. Speaker, as I just said, it is important that the NDP actually support measures that help to protect Canadian families in this area. \lineBreak While I am on my feet, let me remind Canadians about how the NDP feels about jobs and the economy. It is pushing a $10 billion tax hike on employers that would kill Canadian jobs, a massive CPP payroll tax hike that would kill jobs, an anti-trade agenda that would limit Canada's exports and kill jobs. Why is the NDP voting against a job-creating measure like the hiring credit for small businesses? \lineBreak The NDP needs to explain its anti-job, anti-trade, anti-Canada agenda."
1432,"Mr. Speaker, while the  \lineBreak Will he finally come clean and tell us what is being cut from the ozone program, and why?","Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank my colleague for her question, but it is the same answer. Environment Canada will continue to monitor ozone. The World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre will continue to provide world-class ozone services. \lineBreak Again, I make no apologies for finding the most cost-effective ways for the government to protect Canada's environment. "
1433,"Mr. Speaker, since March 31, Environment Canada has turned off the tap on funding to the Lake Superior binational program. Not only is this program designed to restore degraded areas and protect this unique headwater from pollution and urbanization, but it is also part of long-standing commitments between Canada and the U.S. to protect and restore our Great Lakes. \lineBreak Why is the government threatening Canada-U.S. relations by pulling the plug on this critical environmental initiative? When will it turn the tap back on?","Mr. Speaker, every assumption in that question is absolutely false. We are in the midst of negotiating a renewed Great Lakes water quality agreement. I would advise the member that if she wishes to know more about our plans, to contact me at the department. "
1434,"Mr. Speaker, earlier this year Canada responded rapidly and strongly after the UN Security Council passed a resolution to protect civilians who were being attacked by the Gadhafi regime in Libya. In less than 24 hours CF-18s were airborne from 3 Wing Bagotville en route to their operating base in Trapani, Italy, along with strategic air-to-air refueling support from 8 Wing Trenton's Polaris aircraft. Canada also sent a frigate to patrol the central Mediterranean.  \lineBreak Could the associate minister of national defence please inform the House when our heroes are coming home?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for this very important question and his steadfast support for our brave men and women. \lineBreak Our military heroes are returning home this week after a successful mission. Our personnel helped to enforce a no-fly zone and an arms embargo. Because of their hard work, the world is a better and safer place.  \lineBreak Today, I will be in Bagotville with the Chief of the Defence Staff to welcome home our CF-18 pilots. Military heroes are also returning to CFB Trenton later tonight and CFB Greenwood tomorrow.  \lineBreak Bravo Zulu to all our brave men and women for a job well done. "
1435,"Mr. Speaker, this government is once again demonstrating that it does not have any sort of plan to create jobs, particularly in the regions. Transport Canada refuses to repair the Chandler and Carleton wharves in my riding, despite the fact that their repair would attract 200 jobs. The department does not even want to pay for a study to assess the actual state of the wharves. \lineBreak Why is this government prepared to sacrifice 200 jobs and the economy of the Gaspé?","Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the hon. member would ask such a question. Our government has invested in all sorts of infrastructure and created jobs across the country. It is part of our economic action plan. The NDP opposed all these measures. Now we have entered the second phase of our economic action plan,  and the NDP is, once again, opposing these efforts. It is shameful."
1436,"Mr. Speaker, 30 years—to the day—after the “night of long knives”, contempt for Quebec is as strong as ever in Ottawa. Appointing a unilingual Supreme Court justice and a unilingual Auditor General, destroying the data from the firearms registry, imposing a regressive, extremely costly justice model, and to top it all off, reducing Quebec's political weight all prove that recognizing the Quebec nation was nothing but smoke and mirrors. \lineBreak Will the government admit that it is building Canada at the expense of Quebeckers and that Quebec sovereignty alone can put an end to this contempt?","Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. I am a Quebecker and a Canadian, and proud to be both. Quebec can flourish within this country. That being said, I would remind my Bloc Québécois colleagues that Quebec represents 23% of the Canadian population and has 23% of the seats in the House of Commons. That is what it means to show fairness and respect to Quebeckers."
1437,"Mr. Speaker, regarding the long delays for security checks processed through what we call the vulnerable sector check, I appreciate the extra screening to protect the most vulnerable, but the system is now way overburdened. \lineBreak The manager of this RCMP service said that in the last year alone, the requests went from 2,500 to 40,000. A constituent of mine applied last February 24 and only received her clearance last week. Members will get the idea just how serious this issue is.  \lineBreak There are many people who are unable to get jobs. Many people are unable to volunteer. Will the government now commit to hire more staff at this RCMP essential service?","Mr. Speaker, we do appreciate and value the work that volunteers do as well as the necessity for people who are getting employment to have their security checks done quickly. We have introduced measures that will assist the RCMP in doing that. We encourage the RCMP to continue to work together with its provincial and municipal counterparts effectively and quickly to get the security checks done for individuals."
1438,"Mr. Speaker, until now Canada has been excluded from the trans-Pacific partnership trade talks largely because of our insistence on protecting our dairy and poultry industries.  \lineBreak The  \lineBreak  I would like to know, what has changed? What will Canada give up in order to be allowed into the trans-Pacific partnership trade talks?","Mr. Speaker, we have formally expressed an interest in our willingness to work with the trans-Pacific partnership.  \lineBreak Having said that, all countries approach these negotiations with a view to protecting their interests, as Canada certainly will. Therefore, Canada's approach to the TPP will not be different with respect to the European Union free trade negotiations. Of course, this includes our interest in defending and promoting our specific interests in the economy, including supply management."
1439,"Mr. Speaker, any trade agreement must first and foremost help to develop our communities, particularly communities that depend on agriculture. In June, the government was very clear: it was going to defend the supply management program. \lineBreak The question now is: will the Conservatives take the same approach that they used with the Canadian Wheat Board and try to do away with the supply management program for poultry, eggs and dairy products? ","Mr. Speaker, once again, we have been clear: Canada's approach will not be different in these negotiations from its approach in the European Union negotiations. I repeat: we have officially expressed our willingness to work with the trans-Pacific partnership, but all countries approach these negotiations with a view to protecting their interests."
1440,"Mr. Speaker, in this time of economic crisis, improving trade with the APEC countries must be a priority, but the Conservatives must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Canada must insist that strict environmental standards, respect for human rights—which is a priority—and respect for workers' rights be central to any new trade agreement. \lineBreak Given the Conservatives' track record in this regard, what assurance can the government give that the trans-Pacific partnership will make these rights a top priority?","Mr. Speaker, it is clear. Each time, our country has protected the interests of Canadians. Our Conservative government is concentrating on job creation for Canadians and on economic growth. That is our government's priority."
1441,"Mr. Speaker, 72,000 Canadians lost a full-time job last month. The  \lineBreak Families are unable to pay their bills now. It is not reasonable or smart to eat into the paycheques of workers in the middle of an economic crisis while lowering the taxes of large corporations. \lineBreak Why is this government insisting on dipping into the pockets of Canadians rather than helping them to find work? Canadians want jobs, and the government should be working to find jobs for Canadians.","Mr. Speaker, I guess that outlines the difference between this government and the NDP. We recognized a long time ago that Canadians want jobs. That is why we put in place an economic action plan that actually placed jobs in front of Canadians. We put stimulus money into the economy that helped provide jobs and infrastructure.  \lineBreak However, every time we bring something forward that helps the unemployed--for example, extending EI--the NDP votes against it. There was an EI hiring credit in the last budget; the NDP voted against that as well. "
1442,"Mr. Speaker, it looks like the Conservatives have not even seen the most recent job figures: 72,000 full-time jobs evaporated last month because of Conservative inaction. Also, they have blown their own deficit forecast yet again. The government has no plans to create jobs. It sounds an awful lot like a repeat of 2008 to me. That means Canadian families are going to pay the price. \lineBreak The question is very simple. When will the out-of-touch government get to work, so that Canadians can get back to work? We lost 72,000 jobs last month. Get to work.","Mr. Speaker, I wish that hon. member would have shown the same passion and voted with the last three budgets that actually put in place something that helped Canadians.  \lineBreak  It is a little late to the game to say that we should do something about increasing Canadian jobs. Our economic action plan did just that. \lineBreak There are 600,000 more Canadians working today than there were at the end of the recession, and 81% of those are full-time jobs. That matters to those people."
1443,"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the  \lineBreak A question has arisen with respect to the employment insurance decision by the government to raise employment insurance premiums by some $600 million next year in defiance of the reality that, in fact, the economy has been losing jobs recently and that the economy is definitely slowing down. \lineBreak When we asked the  \lineBreak Why did the government not go all the way and stop the increases as of January 1, 2012?","Mr. Speaker, as the member knows, we have taken a number of steps to address the issues regarding the economy, particularly those with respect to employment insurance. \lineBreak Our government's top priority remains getting Canadians back to work. That is exactly what we are doing. We are working to promote economic growth. \lineBreak I do not know whether the hon. member heard or not, but we have actually made announcements very much specifically dedicated to that effort. We are committed to providing timely service to all Canadians who do need that service. \lineBreak That is what our minister has been doing. That is what our government's policy puts forward for the country."
1444,"Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that the Conservative government decided to increase taxes on workers and employers just as the economy is slowing down. It does not make any sense. No economist or theorist in the country would agree with such an approach.  \lineBreak The government has shown that it can cut tax increases by 50%. Why does the government not go all out and say that there will be no tax increases this year?","Mr. Speaker, the member has a point. Clearly, Canada is not immune to the global fluctuations that are occurring, especially with what we see happening in Europe. Of course, the European markets and what has happened in the United States definitely impact us. \lineBreak I will say what the government will not do. It will not do what the member's party did when it had a surplus in the EI fund, which was to expropriate and actually steal that money to use it for another purpose. \lineBreak I assure the House our government will not follow that example."
1445,"Mr. Speaker, in the past month the  \lineBreak I have a simple question. Will the government rein in this rogue member, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, our government and the member for Peterborough were elected to look out for taxpayers. That is what he has been doing. He deserves the applause of the House on all sides for standing up for taxpayers. That is what he has done. \lineBreak The CBC receives a lot of money from taxpayers. Our government believes that the CBC, the Wheat Board and other organizations have to be accountable for the money they receive from taxpayers. That is what the member for Peterborough has been fighting for. That is what we will continue to pursue with all government departments and agencies, including the CBC."
1446,"Mr. Speaker, we are talking about interfering in the independence of the courts. The parliamentary law clerk clearly said that the member for  \lineBreak Is the attack on the CBC also an attack on the independence of Canadian courts?","Mr. Speaker, we are talking here about accountability and the responsibility of the CBC to be in tune with its needs and to be open to the public about the money it receives from taxpayers. \lineBreak That is what the "
1447,"Mr. Speaker, last week the Conservative Party of Canada pleaded guilty to exceeding campaign spending limits, failing to report election expenses, and violating the Canada Elections Act. Despite being found guilty, the Conservatives are calling it a victory. Plea bargaining and paying the maximum possible fines so that Conservative Party operatives do not get thrown into prison is not vindication. It is contemptible.  \lineBreak When will the government stand up for election spending rules and get tough on the rule breakers in the Conservative Party?","Mr. Speaker, I have a document from Elections Canada which says: \lineBreak The contracting party in this Elections Canada document is the New Democratic Party of Canada."
1448,"Mr. Speaker, anyone can see the difference between trying to respect a man's final wishes and trying to steal an election, as the Conservative Party did in 2006. \lineBreak On August 30, the Privy Council summoned 200 civil servants to a meeting, supposedly to talk about budget cuts. But when they arrived, surprise, they found out it was a party organized to say goodbye to Dimitri Soudas, the  \lineBreak Is this government capable of making the distinction between the public service and partisan politics?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member had the opportunity to apologize on behalf of his party for not complying with the Canada Elections Act. In the document I have here, the New Democratic Party admitted to breaking the law. There is good news for the Conservative Party: all of the Conservatives who were accused were cleared following the agreement that was reached last week."
1449,"Mr. Speaker, not only do the Conservatives do as they please with the public service, as we have seen in the past, but now they are also using Parliament Hill as a private meeting room to honour party insiders or to organize an event for the Conservative Albany Club. Who will be the next guest of honour? The person responsible for cutting $4 billion in public services, the  \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives continue to believe that they do not have to follow the same rules as all other Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member raised the issue of the Albany Club because I would like to make a bit of an advertisement for the NDP. Apparently there is a fundraising party for one of the NDP's leadership candidates, Mr. Topp, at the Albany Club. I guess it is okay for New Democrats to use the Albany Club, but not for us. \lineBreak Having said that, I would be happy to refer this matter to the Ethics Commissioner."
1450,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Despite recent assurances, this weekend the  \lineBreak In light of this announcement, I have a simple question for the government. Has it put the elimination of supply management on the table in exchange for membership in the trans-Pacific partnership, yes or no?","First, Mr. Speaker, I totally reject the premise of that question, but I will confirm that we have expressed formally our willingness to join the trans-Pacific partnership.  \lineBreak All countries approach negotiations with a view to protecting their interests. Canada's approach to the trans-Pacific partnership will not be different in this regard. It will be no different from our negotiations with the European Union. \lineBreak However, I would make it clear that we will continue to defend supply management as we always have."
1451,"Mr. Speaker, the government's answer to that last question is shallow indeed. Almost weekly, the U.S. surprises the minister with new fees or restrictions on Canadian business. Now, as a precondition to our joining TPP discussions, the U.S. is targeting supply management. \lineBreak On Saturday, the minister said the government did not see any reason to join the talks, and 24 hours later the  \lineBreak Will the minister explain how an individual defends something the government is prepared to give away just to get in the room?","Mr. Speaker, the hyperbole opposite is absolutely incredible and amazing. \lineBreak It is obvious to me that neither the member nor his party has read the throne speech, because in the throne speech we defended our position on supply management.  \lineBreak Once again, our position on supply management has not prevented us from signing trade agreements with a number of countries around the globe. Our position on supply management has been clear. We defend it, and it is good for Canadian farmers."
1452,"Mr. Speaker, we are hearing more and more stories like that of Catherine Galliford, an RCMP corporal in British Columbia who was sexually harassed in the workplace for 20 years. How is this zero tolerance? \lineBreak Corporal Galliford has been off work for the past four years as a result of the harassment she endured. \lineBreak Will the government commit to dedicating all the resources necessary to supporting Corporal Galliford and other victims of sexual harassment in the workplace?","Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about these very troubling reports. We expect all members of the RCMP to carry out their duties with integrity and professionalism. Our government is committed to providing all women in the RCMP a workplace free of sexual harassment. I will be raising this issue with the new commissioner very shortly."
1453,"Mr. Speaker, that answer shows that they have been asleep at the wheel. Every day more female officers are coming forward with stories of systemic sexual harassment at the RCMP. It has become so bad that a former RCMP spokesperson says she would not recommend any women opt for a career in the RCMP. If women complain, they get blacklisted. Their only way out is to take sick leave. The harassment complaint procedure is not working in the RCMP. \lineBreak When will the government act to ensure that Canadian women can safely enter a career in the RCMP?","Mr. Speaker, I am extremely concerned about these troubling reports. We expect that all members of the RCMP carry out their duties with integrity and professionalism. Our government is committed to providing all women, and indeed all men, in the RCMP a workplace free of harassment, sexual or otherwise. I will be raising this with the new commissioner very shortly."
1454,"Mr. Speaker, last week, we learned just how badly the government is failing families living along our coastlines. Despite years of warnings, the government has not done a single review of whether the RCMP has what it needs to keep our ports safe. There is no national strategy. No one knows if the RCMP fleet is even strong enough. \lineBreak Does the government's so-called tough on crime agenda include ignoring port safety? Why is it failing to protect families along the coastlines?","Mr. Speaker, it is good to see that the New Democratic Party has actually developed an interest in the RCMP. The member's party has consistently voted against giving the RCMP, and all police officers, the tools they need to do their job. I hope that this is a sign that the NDP will finally start standing up for law enforcement officials, the RCMP, municipal or otherwise."
1455,"Mr. Speaker, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is not even aware of the condition of its fleet, yet the government would have us believe that the RCMP is capable of protecting our ports. This government boasts about being tough on criminals, yet it cannot give the RCMP the resources needed to maintain its vessels.  \lineBreak When will this government decide to take action to ensure that the RCMP has the tools it needs to carry out its mandate, which is to keep Canadian families safe?","Mr. Speaker, this appears to be a trend. There are now two members of the NDP who are interested in the RCMP. The member's party has consistently voted against giving the RCMP and all other police officers the tools they need to do their job. \lineBreak I would call on the NDP to continue with this expression of concern so that we can work together and actually help police officers instead of helping criminals the way the NDP usually does."
1456,"Mr. Speaker, as the House knows, Canada's small businesses are the backbone of our economy and a source of good, well-paying jobs for people all across the country. That is why I was so pleased today to see the  \lineBreak Would the minister tell us what good things he sees coming out of today's announcement?","Mr. Speaker, our government's number one priority is the economy. I was proud to announce this morning more than $80 million toward the strengthening of our small and medium-sized business sectors. This funding will help more than 600 Canadian businesses to adopt new information technologies and new ways of doing business in our digital economy. \lineBreak This $80-million investment will help our small and medium-sized businesses, 600 of which can use this investment to adapt to new technology, become more profitable, hire workers and take advantage of the digital economy.  \lineBreak With steps like this, Canada will lead the way."
1457,"Mr. Speaker, Montrealers are worried about the Mount Royal Tunnel. There are no emergency exits, and two reports indicate that the tunnel does not meet fire safety standards and that it is impossible to make old tunnels compliant with current standards. Yet the commuter train travels through this tunnel every day. \lineBreak Does the government consider the Mount Royal Tunnel to be safe? ","Mr. Speaker, the government has confidence that the tunnel is safe. We look forward to working with our partners to ensure that the safety of federally-owned assets is secure.  \lineBreak If the member is serious about safety, I wonder why his party voted against all the investments we have made in  infrastructure for  transportation around Montreal. The NDP has voted against every budget. If it were serious, it would support this government."
1458,"Mr. Speaker, the government should stop backing away from its responsibilities. The fact is that the licence to use the tunnel is given by Transport Canada. Do Montrealers not deserve to know if this tunnel is safe? In New York, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested to make tunnels safer. Is the government waiting for a fire or disaster before taking action?  \lineBreak Will the government take up its responsibility to protect public safety and act on this issue?","Mr. Speaker, the suggestion made by the NDP member that the government does not take safety seriously is very disappointing. If the member were serious about improving safety, he would work with the government and help us make the investments necessary, as we have done in the budgets of 2009, 2010 and 2011. It is very unfortunate and disingenuous of the NDP to stand and raise this issue when it has voted against the government every time we try to make the situation better."
1459,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' reckless hands-off approach to aviation safety is putting Canadians at risk. Crashes in the north have cast a light on the problems with safety inspections. In my region, prairies and north, we are supposed to have 106 operational inspectors, but we only have 74. In other regions, over one-third of the inspectors are missing, yet we allow airlines to regulate themselves with no hands-on federal oversight. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives take the safety of Canadian families seriously and hire the safety inspectors we need for Canada's aviation industry?","Mr. Speaker, this government takes the safety of Canadians when flying very seriously. The CBC report, to which the member referred, has its facts wrong. We do not allow airlines to regulate their own compliance with safety regulations. We have a safety management system that is the world standard now. Canada was the leader and we will continue to be the leader, in aviation safety.  \lineBreak Again, if the NDP were serious, it would support this government and not scare Canadians about flying. Flying is the safest way of travel, and it is partly because this government makes it so."
1460,"Mr. Speaker, it is simply not enough. The safety management system was supposed to be implemented under the supervision of federal inspectors. However, former aviation inspectors are saying that Transport Canada has lost track of which companies have problems to rectify. Just in northern Canada and the Atlantic provinces, there is a shortfall of 51 inspectors. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives stop putting Canadians at risk and start hiring the inspectors we need?","Mr. Speaker, the safety of Canadians is an absolute priority for our government. The CBC report the previous hon. member was referring to is full of erroneous information. The Canadian air transportation system is one of the safest in the world. Transport Canada inspectors do at least 10,000 inspections across the country every year to ensure that the airlines are complying with the regulations."
1461,"Mr. Speaker, the minister's political staff had access to a veteran's personal medical information. Ironically, the minister cannot discuss individual cases, precisely because of privacy protection concerns. \lineBreak Can the minister explain why and under what circumstances political staff had access to the personal medical information of veterans?","Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that protecting the privacy of our veterans is a priority for our government. We have made significant progress in implementing the recommendations made by the Privacy Commissioner. That is why we have implemented a 10-point action plan, including privacy awareness and training for employees, enhanced monitoring of access, strict disciplinary measures, etc.  \lineBreak We are taking measures to ensure that information about our veterans is under the highest security. "
1462,"Mr. Speaker, when a veteran makes a complaint, the response from the Conservatives is to check and access his personal medical information. It is an abuse of power whose clear goal is to threaten anyone who dares question or challenge them. \lineBreak  The minister suggested last week that he had taken steps to protect veterans' privacy. What are those steps and when will he table them?","Mr. Speaker, I wish the member would listen to the answer. \lineBreak Any breach of privacy is totally unacceptable. We have put in place an action plan to deal with that issue. The Commissioner of Privacy is pleased with the action plan. It deals with employer awareness and training; access, controls and monitoring; and strict disciplinary measures. \lineBreak We are supporting our veterans. The member and his party have left our veterans in a decade of darkness."
1463,"Mr. Speaker, only 8 of the 41 federal judges appointed by the Conservative government this year were women. In 2010, 13 out of 37 appointees were women. However, women have outnumbered men in law faculties for a number of years. In addition, the number of female lawyers in Canada has been rising continually. Canadians want the government and the Prime Minister to show leadership in the area of gender equality. \lineBreak Why have this government and this Prime Minister given so little importance to equality? Will a benchmark be established for future appointments?","Mr. Speaker, no government has been more committed to the promotion of women than this government, and I am very proud to be a part of this government. \lineBreak Perhaps the hon. member has not heard, but when it comes to full-time judges, thanks to our government, women now represent approximately 40% of Canada's judiciary. I was just at the installation of a woman to the Supreme Court of Canada, which makes 5 out of the 11 judges at the federal Court of Appeals women, as are 8 of the 12 judges on the Alberta Court of Appeal and 12 out of the 14 on the B.C. Court of Appeal. \lineBreak The NDP members should not make politics out of the judiciary. Supporting the judiciary is what they should be doing."
1464,"Mr. Speaker, what the government is not telling us is that those numbers are actually just getting worse and worse. \lineBreak This year, under the Conservative government, less than 20% of judicial appointments were women. That is just not good enough. Talented female lawyers and all Canadian women deserve better. \lineBreak Provinces and many other countries have moved to a transparent, arm's-length judicial appointment process. The government needs to improve appointment processes and set benchmarks for gender equity. \lineBreak Why will the Conservative government not act now to ensure equity and equal opportunity for women?","Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of this government's record. We continue to make appointments on the basis of merit and legal excellence. I would ask the hon. member to check her figures. The number of women has gone up under this administration at all different levels.  \lineBreak  I would ask her to quit playing politics with the judiciary of this country. I say to opposition members to support the judiciary and the measures that have been undertaken by this government. It would be good for the NDP."
1465,"Mr. Speaker, our government's top priority remains jobs and the economy. Canada's continuing strong performance in the face of ongoing challenges in the global economy is the envy of the world. With one of the fastest economic growth rates in the G7, low business costs and taxes, the world's soundest banking system and a job-creating pro-trade plan, Canada offers many advantages. \lineBreak Would the hard-working parliamentary secretary please update the House on the recent achievements at the APEC summit?","Mr. Speaker, we continue to strengthen our economic co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region. At the APEC summit, we signed a telecommunications agreement with Mexico and formally expressed our willingness to join the trans-Pacific partnership, which represents a potential market of more than 775 million people.  \lineBreak At the same time, we will continue to defend and promote Canada's specific interests and every sector of our economy as part of our job-creating pro-trade plan."
1466,"Mr. Speaker, immigrants admitted through the government's live-in caregivers stream say that they have been duped by the immigration minister.  \lineBreak Prior to the May election, the minister touted the program's success and the government's supposed plans to help it grow, but now he is clawing back their access to permanent residency and is making it ever harder for new live-in caregivers to come to Canada. \lineBreak Will the minister stand up for these important immigrants, or was his promise to support the live-in caregiver program just another pre-election ploy to grab votes?","Mr. Speaker, I wonder what Ruby Dhalla thinks about this issue.  \lineBreak This government has stood up for vulnerable caregivers in a way that the previous Liberal government was completely inactive. We have, for example, eliminated the requirement for a second medical examination so that when caregivers get sick during their temporary period in Canada, they are not penalized. The Liberals never did that. We have moved the cost of recruitment fees, travel and health insurance from the caregivers to the employers. We have created a blacklist so we will deny work permits for caregivers to abusive employers. We have acted to protect vulnerable caregivers in a way the Liberals never did."
1467,"Mr. Speaker, every year, Canadian cyclists and pedestrians die needlessly when they are sucked under the back wheels of large trucks. Twenty-five years ago in Europe, truck side guards were made mandatory. As a result, cyclists' deaths in Britain were cut by 61%. Having side guards might  have saved the life of Jenna Morrison. \lineBreak What will it take for the minister to act to protect Canadians and make truck side guards mandatory?","Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been involved in this type of tragic bicycle or pedestrian incident. The case last week that the NDP member raised is very tragic. We take all these types of safety matters seriously. We are looking to research to see what can be done in this area.  \lineBreak Having said that, if the provinces feel that side guards are necessary, they are capable of mandating them themselves. I look forward to working with the member and any other member who has an interest in this topic."
1468,"Mr. Speaker, on another subject to the same minister--",Order. The hon. member for Toronto Centre has the floor.
1469,"Mr. Speaker, there is no point in trying to respond to that. This is on another question. \lineBreak There was a third allegation today with respect to an RCMP officer in Alberta regarding a question of harassment. We have two serious allegations of harassment by two women in British Columbia. \lineBreak It is clear from the allegations that have been made that this is now a systemic issue. It is not just one officer complaining; it is clearly a number of officers complaining, and others feeling that they are not able to come forward because of a systemic problem. \lineBreak I ask the minister, what does the government intend to do to deal with an issue that is no longer one by one, but is clearly now a systemic issue in our national police force?","Mr. Speaker, like the interim leader of the Liberal Party, we in the government are very concerned about these reports. In fact, we expect that the new RCMP commissioner will be seized with this issue immediately. \lineBreak I am assured by the  \lineBreak The government's policy, including the RCMP of course, is one of zero tolerance with respect to harassment in the workplace. That is expected of every department, particularly the RCMP."
1470,"Mr. Speaker, last week, we received some great news. Canada's reputation among travellers was recognized as the best in the world by FutureBrand, an international design and branding firm.  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, because of guys like the member for Leeds—Grenville, we have a new national federal strategy for tourism and it is working. I am very proud of that and very proud of our work with the industry. \lineBreak With the national tourism strategy, we have ensured that Canada's tourism businesses create jobs and that our country is positively recognized internationally. I am very proud of what we have accomplished and I wish to thank all members for their work in this area."
1471,"Mr. Speaker, within the last month, courts on Vancouver Island had to dismiss two serious drunk driving cases due to court delays. B.C. provincial jails, like Wilkinson Road Jail in my riding, are already at more than 200% over capacity, with the result being five riots in the system in the last two years. Now the government's ineffective, high-cost omnibus crime bill would put even more strain on our justice system. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, the reason his Manitoba colleagues are supportive of what we are doing is that the particular bill targets those who molest children, the people involved with organized crime and drug traffickers. I suggest that the member go back, spend some time with his constituents and ask them how they feel about these important questions. I am sure that like all Canadians, they will be supportive of what we are doing in this area."
1472,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the  \lineBreak My question is simple: what changed between Saturday night and Sunday? Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, again I would ask the hon. member to go back and read the throne speech and take a look at our position and our stance since 2006, when we first formed government. Our protection and defence of supply management has not prevented us from entering into trade negotiations with partners around the world. The member may think it precludes it, but it actually does not, so we can defend our position on supply management in Canada and still have a pro-job, pro-trade plan for Canada."
1473,"Mr. Speaker, just to revisit the issue, last week the Conservatives finally pleaded guilty to breaking the Canada Elections Act with their in and out scam. They have been hit with the highest fines possible, breaking two counts of the law, yet what we get is a stupid response from the parliamentary secretary speaking of-- ","Order. I think the member was referring to the quality of the response. It certainly is provoking a little disorder, so I would ask him to phrase his question carefully. The hon. member for Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor."
1474,"My apologies, Mr. Speaker. Provocation is not really my thing, but nonetheless I will continue. \lineBreak This is an absolutely ridiculous remark. Are members ready for this? He called it, after pleading guilty, a big victory. When he gets thrown in jail, will he call that a small victory, perhaps? \lineBreak The question remains, how many millions in tax dollars has the government had to shell out to fight the Conservative Party's stonewalling and its clearly baseless lawsuit against Elections Canada?","Mr. Speaker, there are schoolchildren here watching us today. They have been told by some of their teachers that there is no such thing as a stupid question. We do not want them to leave here feeling disabused of that point of view. \lineBreak The Conservative Party did experience a big victory last week when every single Conservative accused of wrongdoing was cleared."
1475,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak What changed?","Mr. Speaker, Canada's position is always that we will protect and promote all our sectors—including our supply management system—in free trade negotiations throughout the world. However, this government's position and our interests are always better protected when Canada is sitting at the table. The other partners have now indicated that they wish to have Canada participate, and we intend to do so."
1476,"Mr. Speaker, we do not have anything against the idea of developing new markets and we understand the importance of the Asia-Pacific zone. That is not the issue. Dairy, egg and poultry farmers are worried. They have seen the Conservatives' contempt for their colleagues in western Canada and the Canadian Wheat Board. \lineBreak What guarantees is the ","Mr. Speaker, once again, this government's position in favour of supply management is well known. However, what the "
1477,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak  No wonder dairy and poultry farmers are worried. First, the government attacked wheat farmers. Next, dairy and poultry farmers will be out of luck. \lineBreak Is supply management on the table, yes or no?"," Mr. Speaker, this government's position in favour of supply management is very well known by producers. It is always our intention when we go to the table to ensure we produce, we protect and we promote the interests of all Canadian sectors, including supply management. That is the position we have taken in all negotiations so far, including negotiations with the European Union, that the provinces, including Quebec, are a party to. We will continue to advance Canadian interests in spite of the knee-jerk opposition of the NDP to any free trade agreement, even to trade with the United States."
1478,"Mr. Speaker, prairie farmers trusted the government when it promised it would not dismantle the Wheat Board without a democratic vote of farmers. The Conservatives have turned their backs on prairie farmers and denied them the right to vote. \lineBreak Now the government is asking dairy and poultry farmers to put all their eggs in the Conservatives' basket and just trust them in trade negotiations. \lineBreak How can farmers possibly trust the government to stand up for supply management after it sold out prairie farmers?","Mr. Speaker, our government will continue to defend and promote Canada's interests in every sector of our economy, including our supply management system.  \lineBreak It is obvious the member has not been following recent developments. On Saturday, the current TPP members issued the long-awaited framework agreement under which negotiations will take place. After a review, we determined that Canada can meet and even exceed the level of ambition called for without in any way compromising Canada's ability to stand up for the supply managed sector."
1479,"Mr. Speaker, Quebec's dairy farmers and poultry farmers know full well that a number of participants in the trans-Pacific partnership forum, including the United States, want to see our supply management system disappear. Just last week, the minister responsible said that it was not in Canada's interest to take part in these negotiations and now, all of a sudden, he is changing his tune. \lineBreak How can we trust a government that prefers to listen to the demands of lobbyists—instead of defending the interests of Canadian farmers—and turns a deaf ear to the demands of Quebec?","Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, this past Saturday the partners of the TPP issued their framework agreement. We reviewed it carefully and determined that it is in Canada's best interests to join those negotiations. I can assure the member that we will continue to stand up for the interests of farmers and that we will defend Canada's system of supply management."
1480,"Mr. Speaker, facing a steamroller of Conservative abuse, prairie grain farmers stood on Parliament Hill today to plead for democratic producer control over the Canadian Wheat Board. One strong reason for such control is to ensure that farmers properly get the money that their grain earns in the marketplace. Will the government confirm that at least $100 million of Wheat Board money that should be distributed to farmers instead is being diverted to force farmers to pay for the destruction of the single desk? Will the government confirm that misappropriation of funds?","Mr. Speaker, the only misappropriation is by the Wheat Board itself in taking farmers' money to run a campaign against farmers' own expressed views. Western Canadian farmers have been very clear that they want dual marketing, that they want the voluntary option of the Canadian Wheat Board. That is why this government was elected by prairie farmers, and that is how we are proceeding."
1481,"Mr. Speaker, the F-35 procurement process has become a real joke. That aircraft is so expensive and so full of flaws that, except for Canada, no one wants to buy it. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, even said yesterday that the Americans might withdraw from the program. Only one person still believes in the future of that aircraft: the  \lineBreak When will he finally open his eyes and realize that Canada is being ripped off?","Mr. Speaker, our government and our closest military allies understand the importance of this program to the protection of our sovereignty. \lineBreak Canada is not the only country among our closest allies warning critics of the damage their reckless plans would cause to the military and aerospace workers. I am pleased that Defense Secretary Panetta is taking similar action to warn Congress of the reckless shortsighted implications such proposals would incur. \lineBreak If the opposition had its way, it would cancel the equipment our air force needs and would put some 80,000 Canadians out of work."
1482,"We know that our CF-18s need to be replaced by 2018 or 2019. Last week, the ","Mr. Speaker, the only crusade is the crusade to malign a very important asset for our young men and women who actually use the equipment, and also to maintain our Canadian sovereignty, as well as to create jobs. \lineBreak The member opposite is stuck in a time warp of useless rhetoric, misinformation and misrepresentation about the benefits to Canada of the F-35 program."
1483,"Mr. Speaker, the U.S. defense secretary now says that because of ballooning costs, it may be time for the U.S. to hit the eject button on the F-35 deal. Israel, Australia, Turkey and Norway are still reconsidering their purchases. So much for the minister's repeated claim that our allies are united and with us on the F-35s.  \lineBreak The government is out of touch. The minister is out of the loop. Canadians are out of patience. Will the government finally put this contract out to public tender?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is wrong. \lineBreak F-35s are coming off the production line. Pilots are flying the jets. Sixty-five Canadian industries are benefiting from the program. Jobs are being created. Our men and women will eventually get the equipment they need to do the job that we require them to do."
1484,"Mr. Speaker, it is clear to everyone that the Conservatives have blown this file totally. \lineBreak The F-35 price tag balloons every time another country drops its order. With the Americans now talking about also pulling the plug, the death knell is ringing louder and louder for the F-35s. \lineBreak When will the minister finally admit the F-35s are an untendered procurement boondoggle in the making? I ask the minister again, when will the government put this contract out to tender?","Mr. Speaker, there was a tendering process. It may not be something the hon. member across would accept. \lineBreak I am pleased to remind the member opposite that the acquisition of the F-35 represents our government's commitment to ensuring Canadian sovereignty while producing the kind of equipment that our men and women need to do their jobs effectively and to achieve mission success."
1485,"Mr. Speaker, police chiefs across the country want to keep the gun registry data for reasons of public safety. Victims of crime want to keep the gun registry to protect public safety. \lineBreak Now we hear the Conservatives have buried their own report that says abolishing the registry will weaken border controls and facilitate gun trafficking throughout Canada. \lineBreak Why is the government endangering public safety by opening the floodgates for arms smuggling and proliferation of weapons across Canada?","Mr. Speaker, that is rich coming from a member who voted against increasing penalties for those who imported firearms into this country illegally. \lineBreak In respect of the analysis presented by the officials, it is misleading. It is flawed. Contrary to the suggestion made in the analysis, neither Bill  \lineBreak Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to end the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all, and that is exactly what we are doing."
1486,"Mr. Speaker, we actually voted for that bill. \lineBreak Just yesterday the  \lineBreak Will the minister stop dividing Canadians and work alongside New Democrats to actually help police officers fix the gun registry and keep this valuable data?","Mr. Speaker, our government has introduced legislation to scrap the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all.  \lineBreak Our legislation will destroy the records, which are inaccurate and unreliable and becoming increasingly so over time. If given the chance, the opposition would once again use the data in order to target law-abiding citizens, when in fact what it should be doing is helping us target criminals."
1487,"Mr. Speaker, what we do not understand is why a senior official in the public safety department is saying that abolishing the firearms registry could lead to increased smuggling of illegal weapons across the Canadian border. This specialist is also saying that eliminating the registry will dangerously hinder the work of police officers when it comes to tracing firearms. \lineBreak The government says it wants to fight serious crime, but considering the action it is taking, anyone can quickly see that it is not walking the talk. The Conservatives' approach is completely illogical. \lineBreak Will this government listen to the provinces, police chiefs, victims and, now, its own advisers for once?","Mr. Speaker, as I indicated at committee earlier this morning, the analysis presented by this official is misleading. It is flawed. Contrary to the suggestion made in the analysis, neither Bill  \lineBreak The member is deliberately trying to paint a different picture than is actually true."
1488,"Mr. Speaker, we know that this government is often surprised by the decisions made by the American government, so I would like to inform the government that the American Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, just spoke with American Senator McCain to inform him that the F-35 program is at risk, meaning that the price of the F-35s will be increasing yet again. \lineBreak I want to ask the government if there is a plan B. Is this government ready to launch a tendering process and a competition that would allow us to save money?","Mr. Speaker, there was a competition between the F-35 and another aircraft. The F-35 won the bid and as I understand it directly from the U.S. authorities, there is no intention at this point in time to pull out from anything. The F-35s are coming off the production line. Pilots are flying them. They are being delivered through the international partners and our program is on track."
1489,"Mr. Speaker, there was neither competition nor bids. U.S. Secretary of Defence Panetta told Senators McCain and Graham that the F-35 program is too rich for the Pentagon's budget and may be either cancelled or reduced severely. \lineBreak The U.S. Secretary of Defence gets it. The U.S. Navy gets it. The Australian military gets it.  \lineBreak What is it about this minister that does not get it? When the program is cancelled, what is plan B?","Mr. Speaker, we are confident that the F-35 program is exactly the kind of resource Canada needs today and well into the future. We are committed to ensuring that our men and women receive the best equipment they need to do their work and do it safely. \lineBreak At the very same time, we are concerned as well about the rhetoric we hear that is misinformation, miscommunication and misinterpretation of what Mr. Panetta said."
1490,"Mr. Speaker, according to the parliamentary law clerk, the member for  \lineBreak Does this member's interference in the legal process not prove that the member does as he pleases, or is this a more general abuse of procedure on the part of the Conservatives?","It is neither, Mr. Speaker. The member for  \lineBreak We on this side of the House applaud the member for  \lineBreak He was elected, re-elected, and elected again to stand up for taxpayers and to ensure that money is being spent appropriately by the CBC. He is doing his work, and we applaud him for doing so."
1491,"Mr. Speaker, the minister does not seem to mind being a mascot on Captain Peterborough's ship of fools, but this is not about applauding someone who is undermining the public broadcaster. This is about a member whose behaviour, according to legal experts, is invalid, unenforceable and unlawful. The law clerk's message is really clear. \lineBreak Is the government about carrying out a kangaroo attack against the CBC or does it respect the independence of the courts, and will it respect the letter from the parliamentary legal counsel?","Mr. Speaker, the integrity of the member for Peterborough on this issue and standing up for taxpayers cannot be challenged by the member opposite, who campaigned time and again to vote against the long gun registry, stood in his place and betrayed his constituents.  \lineBreak The member for  \lineBreak This member asked for a mandate to come to Ottawa and defeat the long gun registry, and he betrayed his constituents.  \lineBreak I will stand by the member for "
1492,"Mr. Speaker, Keystone XL will send thousands of Canadian jobs across the U.S. border and substantially increase oil sands emissions. It will lock us into the export of bitumen for decades, yet the government only listens to its oil lobbyist friends.  \lineBreak President Obama decided this pipeline needs more public input and study. When will the Conservatives stop blindly backing risky pipelines and instead commit to an energy strategy that puts Canadian jobs and the environment first?","Mr. Speaker, I was appalled to hear that NDP members are actually going to the U.S. to advocate against Keystone. They are flying to our largest trading partner to denigrate a project that employs hundreds of thousands of Canadians, generates billions of dollars of economic activity, and funds social services like education for our children and health care for our elderly. It is a disgrace."
1493,"Mr. Speaker, the U.S. State Department has good cause to delay the decision on the Keystone XL project. There are concerns about climate change. It is obvious that the rest of the world gives little credence to this government's public relations efforts concerning the oil sands. Without regulations, our environment is being polluted and our trade relations are suffering. \lineBreak When will this government realize that it takes more than an ethical oil label to hide its failure to protect our environment?","Mr. Speaker, since being appointed as Minister of Natural Resources, I have travelled to Europe, Asia and the United States to defend our interests and to support Canada's jobs and economy.  \lineBreak When the NDP travels abroad, its agenda is to campaign against Canadian industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of Canadians. It is probably the most bizarre international relations strategy I have ever seen, and it proves that the NDP is not fit to govern the country."
1494,"Mr. Speaker, the government finally found a way to improve service scores: it changed the rules. The government is directing employees to not even mention the Service Canada hotline to clients. \lineBreak  The fact is that Canadians contacting Service Canada are facing unacceptable delays and the government is refusing to address the problem.  \lineBreak When will the Conservatives reverse their plan to cut more employees at Service Canada?","Mr. Speaker, the facts are exactly the opposite to what the hon. member has just said. We are working to improve our services to Canadians at Service Canada.  \lineBreak We are automating both the call systems and the EI processing systems, so that Canadians can access the benefits that they need more efficiently, more effectively and in a more affordable manner. We are automating things so that will happen."
1495,"Mr. Speaker, the minister has simply automated her talking points.  \lineBreak The reality is that service automation is already happening and it is clearly not the answer. The minister should face reality and acknowledge that Canadians deserve better service. \lineBreak A new report by Roy Romanow recommends increasing accessibility and standardizing eligibility for EI programs. For too many, after paying for years, help is not there when they need it. The government is failing on access to employment insurance.  \lineBreak Will it commit today to fix it?","Mr. Speaker, during the recent global recession we took significant steps to help the unemployed. We brought in an extra five weeks of benefits for all. We made it possible for people to access more training so they could get new jobs. We brought in a whole range of initiatives to help the unemployed get back to work. We also brought in extra people to make sure that their applications were processed quickly and efficiently. \lineBreak Sadly, despite the protestations to try to help the unemployed, the NDP voted against every single one of those initiatives."
1496,"Mr. Speaker, time is passing, but the Minister’s words never change. Since July, she has been feeding us the same lines, even though reality tells us the opposite of what she says. The NDP has already disclosed figures that the government wants to keep hidden: thousands of Canadians hang up without speaking to an agent. By eliminating further positions, the government is asking Service Canada to do more with less.  \lineBreak Why is the government abandoning working people and their families?","Mr. Speaker, we are trying to help the unemployed get back into the labour market. We have offered them training to prepare them for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Unfortunately, all the NDP does is try to make it easier for them to get employment insurance, not to access the labour market. It wants to have a 45-day work year, but that is not possible. We want to help the unemployed get back to work."
1497,"Mr. Speaker, the Minister can keep saying the same thing all she wants, but the system is not working any more, and the public are the ones penalized by the government’s failure to act. Service Canada does not answer all its calls. It already takes too long to receive benefits. What will it be like if more employees lose their jobs at Service Canada? \lineBreak Why is the government refusing to see reality? Why are families going to pay the price of the cuts at Service Canada? ","Mr. Speaker, we want to help people get employment insurance benefits. The best way to help them is to give them training to prepare them for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Then they will be able to support their families. That is the best way to help them."
1498,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the  \lineBreak Will the government pledge to end this systemic violence not in months, not in years, but now?","Mr. Speaker, I am extremely concerned about these troubling reports. We expect all members of the RCMP to carry out their duties with integrity and professionalism. Our government is committed to providing all men and women in the RCMP with a workplace free of harassment.  \lineBreak I will be raising this issue with the new commissioner very shortly."
1499,"Mr. Speaker, how can we believe that the Conservatives take this important issue seriously when they are asking these women to wait? \lineBreak They did not ask for more time before they attacked the firearms registry, the Canadian Wheat Board or pay equity. \lineBreak This government says it is tough on crime, but when the time comes to act it says to be patient. \lineBreak Can the minister give us assurances that he will not wait for a new commissioner to be appointed before taking the action that is needed to help these women?","Mr. Speaker, our government is concerned about not only the women in the RCMP but also about the men who serve in the RCMP. \lineBreak I am glad to hear that the member opposite has developed a new-found interest in the RCMP, given that the member's party has consistently voted against giving the RCMP, indeed all police officers, the tools they need to do their job. \lineBreak I want to call on the NDP not only to speak out against harassment, but also to speak out in favour of tools that will ensure that we target criminals. "
1500,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime and they gave us a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe.  \lineBreak One key promise during the election was to establish new lawful access proposals. This is an important measure to ensure the police have the tools they need to do their job. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his hard work on this matter. \lineBreak We are proposing measures to bring laws into the 21st century and give police the tools they need to do their job. In fact, even Mark Holland, the former Liberal public safety critic, said he supported these important measures. However, the new third party has shown it is so out of touch that it now opposes new tools for police. \lineBreak I would call on the Liberals to finally stop putting the rights of child pornographers and organized crime ahead of the rights of law-abiding citizens."
1501,"Mr. Speaker, our seniors saw millions in hard-earned savings wiped out when the Conservatives broke their word and taxed income trusts several years ago. Now the government is sticking it to them again. \lineBreak Seniors born in 1940 must convert their RRSPs into RRIFs this year, but the bottom has fallen out of the market, so their RRSPs have lost value and some have incurred substantial losses. \lineBreak Will the minister allow them to wait to convert their RRSPs so they can at least try to rebuild their value?","Mr. Speaker, it is nice to hear that the opposition actually understands some of the challenges that our seniors face. \lineBreak We did extend that deadline for seniors during the recession, but if I recall, all of the opposition voted against that at the time. It matters not what we put forward to help seniors, because the opposition tends to vote against it.  \lineBreak We have actually done a great amount to help seniors prepare for their retirement. We encourage the opposition to support some of those measures."
1502,"Mr. Speaker, the Comptroller General found that 21 out of 47 contracts awarded by CanNor were sole-sourced and that 17 of the 21 were awarded without justification.  \lineBreak The Comptroller General also found evidence of contract splitting to avoid competition. \lineBreak The questions are clear. How much was spent when CanNor broke the rules? Who received the money? Who is going to take responsibility for this mishandling?","Mr. Speaker, as I stated many times, we accept the recommendations coming from the auditor. We are addressing those recommendations. This was the process audit."
1503,"Mr. Speaker, our government is proposing responsible measures to protect families and individuals. The safe streets and communities act would impose tougher sentences on pedophiles, drug dealers and the most violent young offenders. Meanwhile, the opposition wants to treat honest farmers and duck hunters like fugitives, but it opposes tougher sentences for dangerous criminals. \lineBreak The justice committee has held eight meetings on Bill  \lineBreak Can the minister please inform the House about our government's efforts to strengthen Canada's justice system?","Mr. Speaker, at committee, opposition members are back to their basic philosophy and ideology. They are opposing jail time for serious sexual offenders who prey on our children, drug dealers who set up dangerous meth labs in residential neighbourhoods and arsonists who burn people's homes but  are eligible to serve their sentences in their own houses.  \lineBreak However, they are going further. They are upset that criminals bringing cocaine and heroin into this country will be facing mandatory sentences. We disagree with them. They are completely wrong. When are they going to start standing up for victims for a change?"
1504,"Mr. Speaker, it seems the budget cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs are going to be deeper than the minister had given us to believe. \lineBreak The veterans’ hospital at Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, the last one managed by the federal government, is to be transferred to the Government of Quebec. That will be 1,300 fewer employees in the department, in addition to the 500 positions being eliminated as announced last week. \lineBreak How can we hope that our veterans will receive the same quality of service if the department no longer has any employees to deliver it?  \lineBreak  Is this how the Conservatives thank the veterans who have served Canada? Is this how they listen to them?","Mr. Speaker, we have one priority, and that is to serve veterans, and in particular the veterans at St. Anne’s Hospital, who receive exceptional care. That is why we have initiated talks with the Government of Quebec to ensure that our veterans continue to be provided with exceptional services. I have visited that hospital on two occasions—I was there on Saturday—and I observed the professionalism of the staff and their dedication to our veterans. \lineBreak We are going to ensure that our veterans in St. Anne’s Hospital and our 10,000 beds across the country receive first-class care. "
1505,"Mr. Speaker, the government’s supplementary estimates propose ideological cuts of more than $160 million in a dozen departments and agencies. The Parliamentary Budget Officer himself admitted that he is unable to identify all the cuts that have been made and are to come, including $60 million in the Department of Human Resources and $7 million in the Economic Development Agency for the Regions of Quebec. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, we are obviously seeking to ensure that every dollar of taxpayer money is spent wisely. We think it is tremendously important that we return to balanced budgets so that we do not get into the same situation that Greece, Italy and Spain find themselves in. Step by step, we will get it done and protect the core competencies that people depend on, whether it is health care, education or supports for our seniors."
1506,"Mr. Speaker, no one accepts the premise of that answer. \lineBreak The Conservatives told the United States and other Pacific countries that Canada is prepared to give up its supply management system in agriculture. Nonetheless, in this House, the Conservatives maintain precisely the opposite. Both statements cannot be true. \lineBreak Is the government not telling the truth to our trade partners, or is it not telling the truth to our farmers? Which is it?","Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak This government is always seeking to increase our international trade by promoting all our sectors in international free trade negotiations."
1507,"Mr. Speaker, that answer simply means he is getting ready to slash the tariffs. \lineBreak Trade failures abound with the government. It wants so badly to surrender control of Canada's perimeter to the Americans, but it is getting nothing back: no pipeline, no relief from buy America rules, U.S. entry fees imposed, marine taxes threatened, Canadian taxpayers attacked by the U.S. IRS, country of origin labelling still a problem, softwood lumber still a problem, nothing back for killing the Canadian Wheat Board, no market access guarantees. \lineBreak Are the Conservatives going to concede a perimeter deal with all this aggravation continuing?","Mr. Speaker, I do not accept much of the premise of that question including, for instance, the buy America provisions. They have gone nowhere in the U.S. Congress. The fact of the matter is the Liberal Party, when it is in opposition, always opposes our relationship with the United States. That is not in the interests of this country. We have important negotiations going on with the United States on perimeter security and regulatory co-operation. Of course, we will not get everything we want, but that does not mean we will not continue to dialogue with our American friends and ensure we protect and advance Canadian interests."
1508,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's drinking water report card says the government is failing in almost every aspect of water protection.  \lineBreak Only marginal improvements have been made to municipal water treatment since the government was first elected, an area where we should be investing to help cash-strapped municipalities. \lineBreak The report card also gave the government an F for its management of water within its jurisdiction, including first nations reserves and national parks.  \lineBreak Does the lack of a national water strategy explain the government's dismal failure in water management? If not, then what does?","Mr. Speaker, our government is working with first nations in respect of water and waste water, building on our water action plan. \lineBreak We released the results of the national assessment of water and waste water systems in first nations communities in July. We are working with first nations to improve and expand operator and manager training and compliance.  \lineBreak We will be reintroducing first nations water legislation soon to create endorsable standards and guide investments. We are getting the job done."
1509,"Mr. Speaker, a confidential inspection report from 2010 shows that a number of sections of the Champlain Bridge are in mediocre condition, are deteriorating rapidly or must be replaced right away. Entire structures need to be rebuilt in 2012-13. The more time goes by, the more urgent the repairs become in order to ensure the safety of motorists. \lineBreak Can the government tell us if it has an action plan to ensure the safety of the people using the bridge?","Mr. Speaker, as usual, our government is working based on plans, analyses and results. The hon. member is asking us about our plan for the Champlain Bridge. We have invested $380 million in this infrastructure. Does he think that we would have done that without a plan? Come on."
1510,"Mr. Speaker, it is all very well and good to repair the bridge but, at this rate, it will be entirely rebuilt instead of a new one being built. \lineBreak The government kept secret a report indicating that there are real risks that the bridge may collapse. Workers and their families who use the bridge every day should not have to worry whether it will collapse right under them.  \lineBreak If we need to close the bridge, will the minister tell Montrealers what they are supposed to do until the new bridge is built?","Mr. Speaker, playing politics at the expense of the people of the greater Montreal area is not really our style. Just yesterday at lunchtime, I was working with the mayors of Montreal, Longueuil and Brossard. Together, we are continuing to work to ensure that the Champlain Bridge is safe and that traffic is flowing smoothly. \lineBreak While this member wants to scare the public, we are doing the work and making sure things get done. Not only are we making sure that the existing bridge is safe, we are also going to build a new one."
1511,"Mr. Speaker, over the past few months, we have witnessed a protest movement on a scale never seen before. The occupy movement is denouncing economic disparity. People are fed up and they decided to act. \lineBreak The parks might be cleaned up, people may have to go home, but the economic problems will not go away. Unemployment is too high, especially for youth. The income gap is growing. \lineBreak Has the ","The real question, Mr. Speaker, is whether the NDP has heard any such cry.  \lineBreak The focus of Canadians is on jobs and economic growth. That is what this government is focused on. That is why Canada has one of the best records in the world on that. \lineBreak This government does not go to another country to argue against job creation in Canada, but that is what the NDP did, a party that is totally unfit to govern or to even comment on the creation of jobs."
1512,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Last month we lost 72,000 full-time jobs. The new jobs the government has been bragging about are temporary, casual, part-time or low-paying jobs. Even CIBC has said that the jobs created in the past seven months have all been poorly paid. \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, when real Canadians face challenges, they roll up their sleeves and get to work. That is what our industries our doing, despite the NDP's extreme opposition. The NDP goes to the United States to oppose the creation of jobs in Canada. That party is not fit to govern this country."
1513,"Mr. Speaker, our party is doing the job that the  \lineBreak While the financial community is playing roulette with people's savings and major corporations are raking in huge profits and getting tax cuts, real people are paying the price. The quality of jobs is going down and minimum-wage jobs are on the rise. In fact, wages are not keeping up with the cost of living. Real wages are going down, the purchasing power of families is going down and people are having a hard time making ends meet. \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, Canada has one of the best records in the western world on job creation and support for our families. That is our government's clear record, because we remain focused on the economy. \lineBreak That is totally different from the NDP. The fact that the NDP has focused on the Occupy protest rather than on job creation tells us everything we need to know about the NDP. It is a party that is totally unfit to govern or to even comment on job creation."
1514,"Mr. Speaker, I would remind the  \lineBreak Since May 2008, the Canadian economy has created barely 200,000 net jobs—jobs that pay a lot less and are more precarious. Over the same period, 450,000 more people entered the job market. Therefore, some 250,000 more jobs are needed, just to return to the same level. \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, if I can quote the  \lineBreak Ninety per cent of those jobs are full-time jobs, and 81% of those are in the private sector. That is a good news story. I do not know how he could make it such a negative story."
1515,"Mr. Speaker, it is sad. Canadians are struggling with lost jobs and the Conservatives are struggling with bogus job numbers. \lineBreak We have seen, under this government, that the jobs that are created are low wage jobs. One in five Canadian men and one in three Canadian women now make less than two-thirds of the average wage, and the jobs they get pay $10,000 less than the jobs the Conservatives lost. \lineBreak Canadians cannot get back to work until the government does its job. Why does the government not do its job so Canadians can get back to work with family-sustaining jobs, with decent wage jobs, with the kind of jobs that build our economy in this country?","Mr. Speaker, I can say what a $10 billion tax hike would do to jobs. That is what the NDP wants to load on us. It was in its campaign platform. It wants to download that onto Canadians. \lineBreak That would kill jobs. That would be the worst thing that Canadians could see and it would kill jobs. The 600,000 more Canadians who are working than were working in July 2009 would not appreciate that."
1516,"Mr. Speaker, a number of our allies are now reviewing the F-35 contract, which means that the total number ordered may be lower than anticipated. The Americans themselves are facing a great challenge with this. Now we hear that the production of the plane may in fact be delayed. \lineBreak I ask the ","Mr. Speaker, it was the previous government that ran a competition to select a company internationally to create the next generation fighter plane. \lineBreak The current CF-18s will begin to come to the end of their useful life in this decade. That is why we are proceeding with the purchase of new airplanes, with great support by the way from not just the men and women in uniform but also the industry. \lineBreak I have heard no concrete suggestion on how we would proceed from the Liberal Party."
1517,"Mr. Speaker, I will say it again: Canada needs a new, real competition to meet our needs here in Canada, to meet the needs of the Canadian industry and to meet our security needs. That is what must be done. We need to look at how the facts are changing. The government is taking an ideological approach that makes no sense. That is the Liberal Party of Canada's concrete suggestion.","Mr. Speaker, procuring the F-35s is supported not only by the Canadian Forces, but also by the aerospace industry in Canada, particularly in Quebec. The proposal to kill this industry makes no sense. That is why the Liberal Party is getting the cold shoulder."
1518,"Mr. Speaker, the failure on Keystone shows how this out-of-touch government is mishandling our key trading partnerships. \lineBreak The Americans understand that protecting the economy and the environment go hand in hand, yet our government has stuck its head in the oil sands, exporting unrefined bitumen and killing thousands of Canadian jobs.  \lineBreak Thankfully for Canadians, New Democrat MPs have flown to Washington to help explain that most Canadians disagree with the Conservatives. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives start putting Canadian jobs and the environment first?","Mr. Speaker, in a bizarre anti-trade mission the NDP has travelled to Washington to fight against the creation of Canadian jobs. Apparently, those NDP members forgot to ask for permission from their union bosses. Today, Buzz Hargrove supported the Keystone project because it would generate thousands of jobs. The NDP is totally out of touch with ordinary Canadians and economic reality. Send in the clowns."
1519,"Mr. Speaker, as the opposition leader, the Prime Minister appeared on Fox News and criticized the Canadian government for refusing to go to Iraq.  \lineBreak Conservatives know what our MPs are doing in Washington. What the Conservatives failed to do was stand up for Canadian jobs and the environment. \lineBreak Like Americans with Keystone, first nations communities in B.C. do not want the risky Enbridge and TMX pipelines going through their communities.  \lineBreak When will the Conservatives stop playing oil sands cheerleader and agree to consult and protect British Columbian communities?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians are extremely fortunate to have the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world. This project will generate hundreds of thousands of jobs, trillions of dollars in economic activity and revenue to support social services, including education and health.  \lineBreak Are the NDP members so star-struck by jet-setting Hollywood stars that they are blind to the needs of Canadian workers and their families?"
1520,"Mr. Speaker, this government does not understand that in the 21st century, jobs and the environment go hand in hand. That is why two of my colleagues are currently in Washington to pick up the government's slack. The United States has decided to allow more time for studying the Keystone pipeline project because it is concerned about the environmental impact. However, on this side of the border, the Conservatives continue to move forward with blinders on. \lineBreak Will this government follow the example of our neighbours to the South and take the time to truly assess the environmental and economic impact of the Keystone pipeline project?","Mr. Speaker, Keystone XL will create tens of thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in economic activity. These revenues will help fund important social services such as health care and education. Nonetheless, the NDP has gone to the United States, determined to hinder this project and job prospects for Canadians. The NDP position would be laughable if it were not so harmful to Canada's national interests."
1521,"Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are in Washington to tell Americans that the majority of Canadians want natural resources to be developed in a sustainable manner. \lineBreak Both the environment and thousands of jobs are at risk. Several refineries have already closed their doors in Montreal East resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs, especially in my riding. The facts are there and speak for themselves. Now the government wants to export thousands of jobs outside the country. That is exactly what will happen with the Keystone project. \lineBreak When will this government prepare a plan for the sustainable development of Canadian resources and the accompanying jobs?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP seems oblivious to the facts and does not listen very well either. \lineBreak This project would generate hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity. Does the NDP care at all about Canadian workers and their families? Is it so ideologically driven that it is blind to the interests of Canadians?"
1522,"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about families. Yesterday, the minister accused me of using scare tactics, but the fact is that Montreal families are worried that the Champlain Bridge might collapse. Reports tell of crumbling concrete and eroding steel.  \lineBreak Yesterday, I asked the minister if he had a plan for Montrealers if their bridge is shut down while they wait for a new one. He did not have an answer. I will ask again today.  \lineBreak If the Champlain Bridge has to close, what is the government going to do about it?","Mr. Speaker, the difference between them and us is that they want to close the bridge and we want to keep it open and work on it to keep it safe. That is the only difference.  \lineBreak Those members do not care about the population. They care about political ideas. We are doing the job."
1523,"Mr. Speaker, the government's plan for the new Champlain Bridge may cause more problems than it will solve. Montrealers are seriously considering avoiding the new bridge and using the others. Access to the south shore will be even more congested. Is that the government's solution to traffic problems? \lineBreak When will the government present a plan that truly meets the needs of Montrealers?","Mr. Speaker, as usual this member is mixing up jurisdictions. He now wants us, rather than the City of Montreal, to make plans for Montrealers. The federal government owns two bridges and 50% of another bridge in the Montreal area. We will manage what falls under our jurisdiction and let the province manage what falls under its jurisdiction, which he does not understand. He always wants to mix everything up. We are working with facts and not with hypotheses about what will happen in 10 years. We will build a new bridge and we are investing in the existing bridge to make it safer."
1524,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government wants to engage in free trade talks with countries that are clearly opposed to supply management. Producers in Quebec and Ontario want to keep this system, which allows family farms to survive. \lineBreak Will this government admit that it is threatening producers' livelihoods by going ahead with these talks? Will the government recognize that it wants to use supply management as a bargaining tool?","Mr. Speaker, our government will continue to defend and promote Canada's interests in every sector of our economy, including supply management. \lineBreak After a review of the framework that was released on Saturday by the trans-Pacific partnership, TPP, partners, we determined that Canada can lead and even exceed the ambition set out in that framework. \lineBreak All countries approach negotiations with a view to protecting their interests. Canada's approach to the TPP will not be any different from our free trade negotiations with the European Union."
1525,"Mr. Speaker, once again, the government is saying one thing and doing the opposite. The government cannot be trusted. \lineBreak Last week, the  \lineBreak Can the government finally set the record straight? Is it going to stand up for Canadian producers, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, I have always been clear. We would only join negotiations if it were in the best interests of Canadians.  \lineBreak We are standing up for supply management. Unlike the NDP, we do our due diligence first. \lineBreak Last Saturday we reviewed the negotiation framework for the trans-Pacific partnership and are now confident that Canada can meet that ambition and even exceed it. As such, we formally expressed our willingness to join the TPP negotiations. We know that increasing Canada's ties to the Asia-Pacific countries will bring more jobs and opportunities and greater prosperity to hard-working Canadians in every region of our country."
1526,"Mr. Speaker, there is another about-face between a minister and the  \lineBreak Wheat farmers saw it last spring when the  \lineBreak Now the government wants dairy and poultry farmers to just “trust it”. \lineBreak Farming families are asking for a simple answer to a simple question: Is the government dismantling supply management, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, we value the supply management sector in this country. We had it in our campaign platform, unlike the NDP. We brought it forward in a throne speech, which those members voted against. \lineBreak Yes, we are with the supply management sector."
1527,"Mr. Speaker, 40,000 more Canadians were unemployed this month than last but the minister remains committed to cutting 600 call centre jobs at the EI centres. Statistics show that only 32% of incoming calls are being answered within required times and 51%, over half, are being hung up on. \lineBreak It is time for the ","Mr. Speaker, what we are doing is overhauling all of our service delivery programs so that we can modernize them to provide better service to Canadians. There are numerous ways that Canadians looking for help from Service Canada can access it. One is through the call centres, which have a much better record than what the member purports, but they can also click on the Internet and they can show up in person, because all of our front-line services are still there to serve Canadians. "
1528,"Mr. Speaker, in 2006 Monte Solberg was minister for Service Canada, and he went to cut the jobs for summer students. The opposition made such a fuss that the prime minister went over and told Monte, “Fix this, Monte”. To his credit, he had that program put back in. \lineBreak Canadian unemployed are hurting. They are missing monthly payments. They are going six weeks without cheques. They are running their households on maxed-out credit cards. Will he walk over and tell his minister, “Fix this mess”?","Mr. Speaker, we are making every effort to improve the service that we provide to Canadians. The way we are doing it is through automation. That is the best way to get fast service. We are consolidating our EI processes to make them more efficient as well, because Canadians deserve their assistance quickly. That is why we are working to make the system more efficient, more effective and more affordable. "
1529,"Mr. Speaker, week after week, month after month, Syria's brutal regime is cracking down on innocent civilians by killing them in cold blood. We know that Canada has been an active and vocal opponent of these atrocities. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, the campaign of violence and terror against the Syrian people must end. This government has called for President Assad to step down. Our government has taken decisive action by imposing very tough sanctions on the regime and on the key actors who are causing the violence. Canada stands with the Syrian people in their time of need.  \lineBreak While I have this opportunity, I would like to strongly advise any Canadians currently in Syria to leave through commercial options while they are still available."
1530,"Mr. Speaker, last week the Conservative Party of Canada pled guilty to violating the Canada Elections Act, exceeding spending limits and improper reporting. It was charged the maximum fine allowed under the law. As a result of the Conservative scheme, 17 Conservative riding associations received illegitimate rebate money, and Elections Canada has outlined which Conservative riding associations benefited from this illegal scheme. \lineBreak My question is for the Receiver General. What steps has the government taken to recoup this ill-gotten money from the Conservative Party of Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I thought the hon. member was rising today to apologize on behalf of the NDP. Just last week the NDP had to admit that it broke the Canadian election law, that it violated the law in attempting to use the power of the political donation tax credit in order to fund a third party organization. It did so in violation of the law. It has now had to admit it. \lineBreak On this side of the House, every single Conservative accused of wrongdoing has now been cleared. We are very pleased with the outcome. We will continue to stand by the fact that we followed all the rules."
1531,"Mr. Speaker, it is incredible. They are unable to even differentiate between a donation made following the death of our leader and an illegal procedure to get around the law. Is that possible? Taxpayers' money was given to the Conservative Party illegally. Elections Canada has already indicated which riding associations received illegal money and how much they received. The Conservatives have admitted that they violated the act. They know how much illegal money they took. \lineBreak What are they waiting for? Are they going to do what needs to be done and reimburse the taxpayers?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member forgot to mention that it is his party that admitted to violating the Canada Elections Act.

Let me clear. Our government's policy will always be to encourage competition, increase consumer choice and minimize regulation. \lineBreak This is the plan. We have a vision, not those guys."
1536,"Mr. Speaker, what we understand is that the government is turning its back on the majority of Internet users. Indeed, nearly all Canadians get their Internet service from the big suppliers.

Some 94% of Internet users have been abandoned by this government, which is once again protecting its friends in large corporations rather than ordinary Canadians.  \lineBreak Will this government finally admit that affordable Internet access has become a basic need for everyone?","Mr. Speaker, once again, it is very simple. We need to increase competition and choice for consumers and reduce regulation. That is the plan; that is our vision. \lineBreak We introduced the Broadband Canada program in 2010.

How many more first nation children and elders must suffer before the government finally provides a safe source of drinking water?","Mr. Speaker, we have made major investments in our water action plan for first nations since 2006. It is ongoing. We have done a national assessment, so we know where to set our priorities and focus our resources. \lineBreak We will be introducing legislation on water so we can have enforceable standards, and we will develop regulations with our first nation partners.  \lineBreak In addition, the government has implemented a comprehensive monitoring system for this area of Alberta to make sure that the water quality is being appropriately sampled."

It was actually budget 2007 and the Liberals did vote against it in budget 2007.","We have heard enough on this issue. If members want to clarify their positions on it, they can do so at other opportunities but not through points of order."
1547,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the junior finance minister falsely claimed this party voted against an extension of the time to convert RRSPs to RRIFs during our recent recession. The fact is we suggested this measure, we supported this measure, and I voted for this measure.  \lineBreak It is sad to see this Conservative government shamelessly misleading the House to hide the fact that it is refusing to help these seniors. Why will they not give seniors more time to convert their RRSPs into RRIFs so that they can at least try to rebuild their value?","Mr. Speaker, the Liberals vote against so much that it is hard to keep track of what they vote for and what they vote against. There is very little that we have put forward that they have voted in favour of. We actually have extended, from 69 to 71, the age for seniors to roll their RRSPs into RRIFs.  \lineBreak I will say what I know is factually correct: they voted against the tax-free savings account. This measure has been tremendously successful. It is an opportunity for people to save, tax protected, for their retirement, and I am quite sure that they voted against that. In fact, they may stand up and admit it."

Hard-hit families do not know how they will pay the bills, let alone how they will afford to retire. \lineBreak  Instead of taking practical steps to strengthen the guaranteed CPP and QPP, the government wants them to roll the dice with even more of their retirement savings.  \lineBreak Why is the out-of-touch ","Mr. Speaker, I have absolutely no idea what the  \lineBreak What I do know is that today the government announced another step forward on the pooled registered retirement savings plan, something that has been welcomed by pension experts and the small business community across the country. Canadians are looking for options. Canadians are not looking for a hike in their CPP premiums, as advocated by the NDP."
1550,"Mr. Speaker, the facts speak for themselves. In the last quarter alone, the CPP outperformed the markets ten to one. \lineBreak The markets are tanking around the world, but the Conservatives want Canadians to invest even more of their hard-earned money in those markets without any guarantee that doing so will pay off one day. \lineBreak What is the government's plan for families who are bogged down in debt and do not even have any money to save? What does the government suggest they do? Should they never retire? ","Mr. Speaker, today's announcement of a new retirement savings tool for companies and individuals was well received by the business community, small and medium-sized enterprises and Canadians across the country. Canadians are not looking for a hike in their CPP premiums, as advocated by the NDP."
1551,"Mr. Speaker, today the minister said that when we buy in bulk, we save money. That is certainly true with the CPP and the QPP. In the last quarter, the CPP outperformed the markets by a ten to one factor. The chief actuary says that CPP is funded for 70 years. Increasing CPP and QPP will mean money in the pockets of retiring seniors. \lineBreak Why is the government's only plan to line the pockets of mutual fund managers? Why will it not increase the CPP now?","Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that today we have a good news story. We have introduced a very new pooled registered pension plan that will help millions of Canadians who otherwise have not saved for retirement. \lineBreak I have to question the member's commitment to that statement when people within the CFIB have said time and time again that if we raise CPP, they are very worried about jobs, and right now we are concentrating on jobs and the economy and our low-tax plan to maintain those."
1552,"Mr. Speaker, the minister in charge of this file knows that we have been willing to work with him; in fact, we have been working with him for the past three years. New Democrats have been standing up for the tried and true Canada pension plan because that is Canadians' best option to be protected. How can people trust the government to help them when pensioners call Service Canada and are put on hold because there are not enough people? Reckless Conservative cuts at Service Canada are leaving pensioners in the cold. They are waiting months to get their cheques. \lineBreak  Why is the government choosing risky schemes and reckless cuts over the needs of vulnerable seniors?","Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that union leaders, who are clearly very convincing for members of the opposition, are selfishly attempting to ensure that old, inefficient and labour-intensive methods of processing EI applications remain in place. Our government's top priority is to get Canadians back to work and to promote economic growth. We are committed to providing timely service to all Canadians who access these systems."
1553,"Mr. Speaker, today in the House we are debating the question of an effective strategy for clean running water for every single Canadian across the country, and it seems to have the support of all parties as we move forward. \lineBreak I would like to ask the ","Mr. Speaker, there is no need for me to outline today that the government is willing to take action on this. The government has been taking action over the past several years. We have made significant investments in this very objective because it is important for communities, particularly native communities across Canada. \lineBreak  What is not explicable is why the Liberal Party continually votes against these investments, so I welcome today the Liberal Party's conversion to doing something about this issue."
1554,"Mr. Speaker, we can argue about conversion dates at some other point, but let me draw the attention of the  \lineBreak The other day I visited the Six Nations reserve, which is the most highly populated reserve in the country. It has a serious drinking water problem. There are 315 homes that have no water supply whatsoever.  \lineBreak At the same time as the  \lineBreak What is the ","Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Liberal Party should know that obviously land claim negotiations in this particular area have been difficult and have been ongoing for some time, but we continue to work to try to get them resolved."
1555,"Mr. Speaker, the Ontario government has clearly said that this has been going on for centuries. The federal government itself recognized this fact when it made an offer of more than $100 million, which was turned down by the aboriginal negotiators. The Ontario government has agreed to the appointment of a mediator, but the Government of Canada refuses to appoint one. \lineBreak If the government is serious, why is it not appointing a mediator to work through this major problem?","Mr. Speaker, once again, negotiations have been ongoing for decades, at least. This government has made offers, as the leader of the Liberal Party said. \lineBreak The fact of the matter is these are extremely complex negotiations. They are particularly complex given the governance structure on the other side, but we continue to work to try and get this problem resolved."

Our party is doing the work that the Conservatives refuse to do. \lineBreak The environmental consequences of the Keystone—",Order.  \lineBreak The hon. member has about four or five seconds to complete his question.

Maybe they will listen to union leaders like Christopher Smillie, who represents 200,000 workers. He said “The NDP would be very bad for workers and the entire Canadian economy. They haven't risen to the task”.  \lineBreak If the NDP will not rise to the task of supporting Canadian jobs and they are hostile to Canadian employers, whose interests do they represent in this country? "
1558,"Mr. Speaker, first the government robbed wheat farmers of their right to vote. Now we know the minister is taking wheat farmers' money to fund his folly.  \lineBreak In an eleventh hour act of desperation, the government has increased the cap on the Wheat Board's contingency fund from $60 million to $200 million to fund its own ideological obsession with killing the single desk. That is money that should rightfully be returned to farmers. \lineBreak When did the government get into highway robbery and when will the minister do the right thing and give farmers back their hard-earned money?","Mr. Speaker, of course, this contingency fund has always been held separately from farmers' pool accounts. As a government, we took this prudent measure to protect the future of western Canadian farmers, Canadian taxpayers and, of course, the new voluntary wheat board.  \lineBreak Mr. Oberg continues to waste millions of dollars of farmers' money on his own personal political agenda. Since it is unclear what additional liabilities he will leave behind with his scorched earth policy, we have taken this prudent step."
1559,"Mr. Speaker, there is nothing prudent about what the government is doing. Elected farm directors are abiding by their oath of office. It is too bad the minister could not do the same. The minister knows the contingency fund is a result of the current board's management and comes from farmers' grain sales. His increasing the fund by executive order is an admission of greater risk under his government board. However, to expropriate millions of dollars of farmers' money is akin to theft. \lineBreak  How can the minister justify taking farmers' money to run his government-controlled grain company?","Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed, like western Canadian farmers. I thought, since the member for "
1560,"Mr. Speaker, today we have more evidence that this government has no credible plan to help small business and that the so-called plans they have, such as the Canada small business financing program, are working poorly, if at all. \lineBreak It is outrageous that Industry Canada had no comment to make on allegations that funds have been diverted from the program. The minister absolutely must fix this program to ensure that it can fulfill its role and truly help small businesses. \lineBreak Can the minister tell us today how much money Industry Canada has lost in this program by paying down loans for businesses that declared bankruptcy because they did not receive any really effective help?","Mr. Speaker, as far as help for businesses and entrepreneurs is concerned, I am very proud of this government's record. We have reduced the tax rate to 11% for small businesses and, effective January 1, 2012, to 15% for all businesses in Canada. That is a realistic record. It is a concrete record that is important for small businesses. As far as any potential fraud is concerned, I encourage people who witness illegal acts or fraud to file complaints with the appropriate authorities. It is a serious matter. Taxpayers' money is at stake."
1561,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian small business financing program has failed to help the companies it was supposed to support. Now we are seeing fraud in the government's program. It is not the first time the government has dropped the ball in these matters. Consumers and small businesses are still getting gouged because the government refuses to cut merchant fees for credit cards. \lineBreak Why has the government abandoned Canadian workers and small businesses?","Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear in what I said in French.  \lineBreak All Canadians, who know something about that or who are witnesses on some front, must declare that to the authorities because it is important. It is taxpayer money and we take that very seriously."
1562,"Mr. Speaker, last week, the  \lineBreak When will the minister give it back?","Mr. Speaker, what western Canadian farmers are looking for is an opportunity to market their own grain, durum and barley, and we will give them that opportunity. \lineBreak  The contingency fund is there. The Wheat Board has used it at times, like a slush fund. We want to ensure that Mr. Oberg's sticky little fingers stay out of that, as they have been dipping into the pool accounts on farmers, spending tens of millions of dollars buying boats, spending like drunken sailors. \lineBreak We will not allow that to happen. We will hold that contingency fund and help western farmers use that money in their own best interests."
1563,"Mr. Speaker, the farmers he intends to give it back to are the ones who are actually leaving and do not get it. \lineBreak It is really simple. The government promised to allow Wheat Board farmers a vote and it broke that promise. Now the government is imposing a $200 million grain tax on western farmers. \lineBreak Last week, the government agreed to join the trans-Pacific partnership but will not tell Canadians if supply management is on the table. \lineBreak  The government sold out western farmers. Will it do the same thing to supply managed farmers across this country as it did to western farmers this week?","Mr. Speaker, this government respects the hard-working families who work on our dairy and poultry farms and who gather eggs every day so we can have them for breakfast. They respect that in us. We have been there for them when they need us.  \lineBreak We have a tremendous working relationship with the supply managed sector. We had it in our campaign platform. Those members did not. We put it in the throne speech. They voted against it. Who do members suppose supply managed farmers support? It is this side of the House."

1572,"Mr. Speaker, another Canadian winter will soon begin and families are already wondering how they will survive. With heating costs continuing to soar, too many families will have to choose between keeping warm and having food to eat. This is not a choice that Canadian families should have to make. \lineBreak Why is this government not listening to the New Democrats and removing the federal tax on home heating? Why does it not give families a break this winter?","Mr. Speaker, once again, the NDP is talking about jobs and the economy, and asking how we can help families when they have bills to pay. I will say it once again: we must ask the New Democrats why they continue to go to Washington and elsewhere to eliminate jobs. It is through these jobs that Canadian families will be able to pay their bills. One has to wonder why the NDP is always trying to eliminate jobs in Canada that would help families to pay for everything they need in this world today."
1573,"Mr. Speaker, that answer will not help families heat their homes. Even the government's Conservative cousins in Ontario know that listening to New Democrats is the right thing to do. They agree with taking the sales tax off home heating, but the out-of-touch government does not get it. Canada gets cold; heating one's home is not a luxury. \lineBreak When will the government get onside with its Conservative cousins and work with New Democrats to give families a break?","Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the House about the 120 taxes that were cut so that Canadians could keep more money in their pockets to pay for all of these things. There are $3,000 more in the hands of Canadians today thanks to this government. Every single time we put a measure forward, the NDP voted against it. \lineBreak Let us think about those jobs that the NDP is trying to kill. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs in the oil sands and the NDP is trying to kill those jobs. These are jobs that families need to pay for home heating. Let us not forget the GST.

Developers can locate anywhere they want, without consulting the municipalities, if Transport Canada gives them the authorization to do so. \lineBreak Will the minister commit to meeting with the mayor of Neuville and all the other mayors who have concerns about this law?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the hon. member that, in Quebec, mayors fall under the jurisdiction of the Quebec ministry of municipal affairs, regions and land occupancy. We have always been in the habit of respecting the jurisdictions of each sector. I am happy to speak to the minister, Laurent Lessard. He would be happy to speak to the mayors of all the regions of Quebec who are under his responsibility. With regard to transportation safety as it relates to airports, Transport Canada's main role is to ensure the security of airports and the safety of all travellers. We will continue to do this."
1579,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of Quebec could not make it more clear: if the Conservatives are bent on dismantling the gun registry, they must give Quebec the data so that it can maintain this tool that saves lives. Quebec's public safety minister, Robert Dutil, even came to Ottawa to remind the government that Quebeckers helped pay for the registry and they are entitled to the data. \lineBreak Now that the Conservatives can no longer hide behind the false pretense of protecting personal information, will they allow Quebec to retrieve the data from the registry it paid for, yes or no?","Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign we promised to destroy the gun registry. Guess what? The registry is made up of data, information. That is all there is to destroy. I do not know what else my colleague would like us to destroy. We will destroy what we promised to destroy because the data is wrong. The Auditor General said so on September 26, 2006. \lineBreak In closing, I will quote the Auditor General: \lineBreak We will be destroying information that is wrong."
1580,"Mr. Speaker, the Americans are seriously considering backing out of the F-35 program. It is clear what will happen if the Americans pull out. There will be no F-35 program. Yesterday, right here in the House, the  \lineBreak Now that it is clear that plan A is not working, will the minister finally tell us what plan B is?","Mr. Speaker, all reasonable people agree that the Canadian Forces require a fighter fleet to face the challenges of the 21st century.

Everyone is facing the facts and admitting that the F-35 program is not working—everyone except the  \lineBreak How much longer will the ","Mr. Speaker, let me repeat that our plan is on track. We continue to monitor this investment. We are working towards progress. The planes are coming off the production line. Pilots are flying them. They are being delivered to the joint strike fighter team. \lineBreak  Not only that, unlike the NDP travelling to the U.S. in an effort to kill and derail thousands of Canadian jobs, when we meet with U.S. authorities, it is to create Canadian jobs."
1582,"Mr. Speaker, the only competition that has ever taken place for the F-35 has been between the  \lineBreak Yesterday, the  \lineBreak I have a simple question for whoever is in charge today. If the government has a plan B for replacing our fighter jets, what is it?","Mr. Speaker, all reasonable people agree that the Canadian Forces require fighter jets to do the job for the challenges of the 21st century. The best plane and the only state-of-the-art stealth aircraft available to Canada to face the challenges of the next 30 years is the F-35 joint strike fighter. \lineBreak Our plan is on track. We continue to monitor this investment closely through direct contact with Lockheed Martin, as well as the U.S. authorities and the project team. There is no trading our commitment. There is no downgrading of the commitment. We are there. We are on track."
1583,"Mr. Speaker, since we are trading literary recommendations today, I hear there is a new publication called “Buying Jets for Dummies”. I recommend it to the  \lineBreak The  \lineBreak Here at home, New Democrats have a great plan B: put the file out to tender. Will they?","Mr. Speaker, maybe the hon. member could lend me his copy of the book. \lineBreak In any event, I am not going to get into the rhetoric. I can guarantee that the plan is on track. We are sticking with the program. The planes are coming off the production line. They are being flown by pilots who know their business. I prefer to listen to them and to the experts rather than the idle chatter from the opposite side."
1584,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak In reality, the government has used those planes no less than 71 times a year. Will the government House leader apologize? \lineBreak Or, does he want to borrow a book that I just acquired called “Flying Challenger Jets for Dummies”?","Mr. Speaker, I will concede that, when it comes to flying Challenger jets, we have a lot to learn from a former Liberal cabinet minister . When we compare our record with the Liberal record, there is no comparison. The Liberals have us beaten by 100,000 kilometres, I bet, if not far more. They were in the air all the time. It is a hard thing to come down to earth like they have. However, when it comes to the use of Challenger jets, it is lower under our government than it has been under any other government in years."
1585,"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to ask, for the first time as deputy House leader of the official opposition, the usual Thursday question. \lineBreak To start, I would like to point out that, according to the second edition of  \lineBreak That is unfortunate, because just yesterday, the government saw fit to shut down debate on another bill, Bill  \lineBreak Could the government House leader tell us and all Canadians what bills he is planning to subject to time allocation next week, other than the 644 pages of Bill ","Mr. Speaker, as we have said before, our government's top priority is the economy. Despite global economic challenges, nearly 600,000 new jobs have been created in Canada, 90% of them full-time. Through Canada's economic action plan our government has put forward focused and effective policies that have promoted job creation and economic growth in all sectors of the economy. That has been reflected in this week's successful jobs and economic growth week.  \lineBreak Our government will continue to focus on delivering important measures for Canada's economy. Thus, next week we will be delivering results on jobs week, and anticipate passing the next phase of our low tax plan for jobs and growth next week.  \lineBreak Beginning tomorrow, we will move forward on report stage for Bill  \lineBreak  We will continue debate on Bill  \lineBreak On Monday, we will have the final day of debate on Bill  \lineBreak On Tuesday morning, we will continue debate on Bill \lineBreak On Tuesday afternoon, we will continue debate on the opposition's motion to block Bill  \lineBreak Bill  \lineBreak As is always the case, we will give priority to other important bills that may be reported back by committees. I refer especially to Bill  \lineBreak Finally, the next allotted day will be on Friday, November 25."
1586,"Mr. Speaker, why would Canadians believe this government, which is sitting idly by while jobs are disappearing at an alarming rate? Just yesterday, we learned that 600 workers at the White Birch plant in Quebec City will be out of a job just before Christmas. While the number of unemployed workers is on the rise, the number of employment insurance claimants is dropping because fewer and fewer workers qualify for benefits. \lineBreak The question for the ","Mr. Speaker, we are well aware that the world economy presents challenges and that, from time to time, jobs are lost in Canada. When this sort of thing happens, we work with the communities.  \lineBreak It is important to say that what we do on this side of the House is work on employment and job creation. We have measures before the House to do that. What we do not do is what the NDP does, which is demand that industries be shut down, demand that taxes be raised on employers and go to other countries to fight against Canadian trade. On this side of the House, we are dedicated to fighting for Canadian jobs, not against Canadian jobs."
1587,"Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we talk with our trading partners and not at them. \lineBreak We went to Washington to ensure that the voices of all Canadians were being heard, something that the government refuses to do. In Washington they are moving forward with trade on clean energy products and a clean energy economy, but because of Conservative inaction, Canada is being left behind.  \lineBreak These are Canadian jobs we are talking about. When will the government stop the attacks, stop the environmental inaction and move forward on building a clean energy economy for the future?","Mr. Speaker, there have been historic diplomatic trips; the allies to Yalta and Nixon to China come to mind. The sad NDP junket to Washington will not merit a footnote in the history books. However, it is a classic example of how far a party can be disconnected from the real concerns and real needs of ordinary Canadians, especially jobs and social services. \lineBreak The official opposition is not ready for prime time."
1588,"Mr. Speaker, if standing up for clean air and water and good Canadian jobs is sad and disconnected, bring it on.  \lineBreak Most Canadians do not want to sell out our environmental future and lose thousands of Canadian jobs to a risky pipeline. Our out-of-touch  \lineBreak When will the Prime Minister stop listening to the oil lobby and start listening to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, the emissaries are back from their job-killing trip to Washington. They apparently felt it was their patriotic duty to block an important project that will generate jobs, economic activity and energy security. This is precisely the wrong time to block shovel-ready projects. \lineBreak Out of compassion for my fellow parliamentarians, I recommend the book "
1589,"Mr. Speaker, this morning the Quebec public safety minister appeared in committee to prevent the government from scrapping the gun registry and destroying its data. What was the government's response? A deafening silence. Instead, it attacked the credibility of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. We also learned that the  \lineBreak Why is the government refusing to listen to the Government of Quebec, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, and victims?","Mr. Speaker, the answer is quite simple. Our Conservative government does not support treating law-abiding hunters, farmers and sport shooters as criminals. We have consistently opposed this wasteful and ineffective measure, which does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. \lineBreak Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to end the long gun registry once and for all, and that is exactly what we are doing."
1590,"Mr. Speaker, since we are talking about books, I also have a book to recommend. It is called “Democracy for Dummies”. \lineBreak Not only is the government completely ignoring all appeals, but it is also preventing parliamentarians from doing our jobs by shutting down debate in committee—and not just any committee, the justice committee. Could anything be more undemocratic? \lineBreak Canadians have already paid for the data—extremely useful data—in the firearms registry and, rightly so, the provinces would like to have that data back. \lineBreak Will this government finally stop mocking our democracy and give Canadians back the data that belong to them?","Mr. Speaker, public policy must be judged by its real effects on the ground, and not by its intentions. When it comes to real effects, the part of the firearms registry dealing with long guns has never in any way helped prevent crime in Canada. Furthermore, regarding the data, I would like to remind my colleague what the Auditor General said on September 26, 2006:"
1591,"Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Conservatives finally decided to compromise a little and allow members of Parliament to do their work and examine the provisions of Bill  \lineBreak Can the government confirm that it is prepared to amend its bill in order to focus on rehabilitation and social reintegration?","Madam Speaker, Canadians, including Quebeckers, want this government to take action to protect the people of Canada from criminals. That is why we introduced Bill  \lineBreak If the opposition parties have amendments to propose that will provide Canadians with stronger protection against criminals, the government will consider them. However, we are asking the NDP why it has voted against every bill designed to protect Canadians from criminals."
1592,"Until now, the government's approach has not been very constructive. Yesterday, all of a sudden, they saw the light. It seems that there is now a small opening. \lineBreak Since statistics show that Canada's crime rate is declining, will the government commit to taking the necessary time to examine the bill? Are the Conservatives prepared to consider amendments in order to help communities invest in front-line police services rather than forcing the provinces to hire prison guards?","Madam Speaker, we have already added resources to hire more RCMP officers and provincial and municipal police officers. We have already invested more in community crime prevention programs. \lineBreak In fact, 77% of Quebeckers expect Parliament to adopt stricter laws and tougher penalties for criminals, and that is what the government is doing. "
1593,"Madam Speaker, we can all agree that the government's heavy-handed approach has not helped to elevate public discourse and certainly has not helped to make Parliament work. \lineBreak The Conservatives have used closure seven times in 25 sitting days and countless times at committees. \lineBreak Shutting down debate is no way to operate for a government rejected by 60% of Canadian voters. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives put an end to the repeated use of closures and let MPs do their work?","Madam Speaker, by the same strange math, over 80% of Canadians voted against the NDP. They voted against the soft-on-crime, high-tax, job-killing agenda of the NDP. They voted for a government that will focus on job creation and safe communities. That is what we are delivering through our platform commitments. \lineBreak We, of course, are committed to debate. These two bills, the budget implementation act and the crime omnibus bill, have received 48 hours of debate in this place and 152 speeches. Many of these items have been debated repeatedly in different sessions of this Parliament.  \lineBreak We are committed to debat,e but we are also committed to acting and keeping our platform commitments."
1594,"Madam Speaker, yesterday, the government finally agreed to delay ramming Bill  \lineBreak Will the government agree not only to stop ramming this behemoth of a crime bill through, but to allow a meaningful debate and agree to reasonable amendments, like the ones suggested by groups such as the Canadian Bar Association, legal experts and the provinces?","Madam Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime, which is why they gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. We need to keep that focus. \lineBreak The opposition wants to punish law-abiding duck hunters and farmers but oppose tougher sentences for pedophiles and drug dealers. \lineBreak The fact is that Parliament has already seen and debated the measures contained in Bill "
1595,"Madam Speaker, the Conservatives used to complain about Liberal arrogance, but the behaviour of the Conservative government makes Liberal arrogance look like humility. \lineBreak The government can do things differently. New Democrats are reasonable people. We have constructive amendments to bring forward based on what we heard at committee, including those proposed by the province of Quebec.  \lineBreak What was not reasonable was to shut down debate, limit time and refuse to work with others. It is not what Canadians want. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives agree to listen to Canadians and change their ill-advised, prison-based crime agenda?","Madam Speaker, the time for talk is over. The time for action is now. By moving quickly to reintroduce these measures to make our streets and communities safer, we are taking action, as we committed to do. Our focus is to meet the promises we made and to stand up for all law-abiding Canadians. \lineBreak I was in those same meetings yesterday and the hon. member was the one who moved the amendment to agree to time allocation to get this done by Wednesday at midnight, and we appreciate his co-operation."
1596,"Madam Speaker, as we all know, ever since Parliament opened in September, this government has not stopped showing its contempt for parliamentary democracy, either by constantly trying to limit debate on bills or by using secrecy and intimidation tactics in committee. Having a majority does not entitle the government to abuse its power. \lineBreak When is this government going to change?","Madam Speaker, on the contrary, on two important bills—one on the budget and the other on crime—we had 152 hours of debate and 48 speeches. During previous sessions in the past few Parliaments, there have been many debates on a number of bills. At the end of the day, the government has a mandate from Canadians, who expect the government and Parliament to get moving on implementing our economic action plan and our bills to protect communities from crime. That is what we are going to do."
1597,"Madam Speaker, being in power also means working with the provinces. Over the past week we have seen this government's attitude toward Quebec. We have seen how the Conservatives are dealing with Bill  \lineBreak Working in our country, within this confederation, also requires working with the provinces. When are they going to do that?","Madam Speaker, this government has an extraordinary record when it comes to federal-provincial relations. That is why we have seen an extraordinary decline in support for separation in Quebec. Quebec has received a 60% increase in its federal transfers. Quebeckers expect Parliament to legislate harsher sentences for criminals. In fact, 77% of Quebeckers expect that and we are going to deliver. We are going to deliver a fairer justice system for Quebeckers and Canadians."
1598,"Madam Speaker, the arrogance of the government knows absolutely no bounds. It is limiting debate and pig-headedly refusing to work with the provinces. This week, one minister from Quebec said that this was not a government that was tough on crime, that this was a government that was tough on democracy.  \lineBreak Yesterday, in committee, a Conservative member told people that police representatives were misrepresenting the truth. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives stop acting like bullies and act in a responsible manner in this democratic country?","The real question, Madam Speaker, is when will the Liberal Party finally learn the lesson of the last election. Canadians want parliamentarians to stand up for victims of crime rather than criminals. When will the Liberals understand that 77% of Quebeckers say that there should be more serious penal sentences for criminals? When will the Liberal Party understand that it is unacceptable to Canadians that too many repeat and even violent criminals end up with house arrest or go through the revolving door of bail?  \lineBreak Canadians believe that serious criminals should do serious time. We agree with Canadians and we will act to ensure that happens."
1599,"Madam Speaker, after almost three decades of legal battles the Supreme Court of Canada made a quick ruling in favour of women workers at Canada Post asking for pay equity. Women should not have to wait so long for justice. \lineBreak The government has turned back the clock even further by introducing regressive legislation that excludes women from even making complaints. \lineBreak Why does the government not believe in the right of equal pay for work of equal value? Why is the government so tough on women?","Madam Speaker, the government is committed to equal pay for equal work. The decision in this three decades old case actually shows that the previous system was broken. Our government fixed the system, so that unions can no longer negotiate away equal pay only then to force legal, costly and adversarial court battles. \lineBreak Women should not have to wait decades to get equal pay for equal work."
1600,"Madam Speaker, that is the problem. The Conservatives do not understand the concept of pay equity. We are talking about equal pay for work of equal value. \lineBreak The Conservatives' pay equity bill is nothing more than a smokescreen. Women and unions are no longer able to make complaints. The result is simple: women must forget about justice. Today, women still earn 70¢ for every dollar a man earns. We need federal pay equity legislation similar to what we have in Quebec. Canadian women deserve equality. \lineBreak Why does this government refuse to ensure that women earn the wages they deserve?","Madam Speaker, our government believes that women deserve equality. Our Conservative government believes in the principle of equal pay for equal work. The decision made in this nearly 30-year-old case shows that the previous system was broken. Our government fixed the system so that unions can no longer negotiate away equal pay and then provoke long and costly legal battles. \lineBreak Women should not have to wait decades to obtain equal pay for equal work."
1601,"Madam Speaker, at the last G20 meetings the government signed on to the principles of consumer protection for the financial sector. It promised to guarantee access to a fair and independent complaints system for Canadians, and yet the TD Bank recently walked away from the banking ombudsman without even a peep of concern from the government. \lineBreak Why is the government refusing to stand up to banks and protect Canadian consumers from being gouged?","Madam Speaker, currently, all banks are required to have consumer complaints procedures in place and have a third party dispute-handling body. \lineBreak However, there is variation in procedures used, and this is of concern to us and to consumers. To better protect consumers, we are forcing banks to belong to government approved independent third party bodies. We are establishing uniform regulatory standards for internal complaints procedures. We are giving the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada the authority to monitor and enforce compliance. We passed legislation for this and are now finalizing regulations. \lineBreak Unfortunately, the NDP voted against all of that."
1602,"Madam Speaker, we vote against the government's inaction on creating jobs and the economy.  \lineBreak What we need to see from the government is not allowing the big banks to police themselves. The Royal Bank and the TD have dropped out. Others could soon follow. The Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments has helped protect Canadians for more than 15 years, the best way to keep the banks honest. However, the government cares more about tax breaks for banks than keeping them accountable. \lineBreak When are the Conservatives going to close the door on allowing banks to leave the OBSI and protect Canadians?","Madam Speaker, I am going to close the door on that feigned concern for Canadians and the economy. \lineBreak When we look at the real facts here, NDP members really do not care about jobs and the economy. Why are they pushing a $10 billion tax hike on employers that would kill Canadian jobs? Why are they subscribing to a massive CPP payroll tax hike that would kill jobs? \lineBreak The NDP has an anti-trade agenda. It is anti-Canada by going to the United States and asking that Canadian jobs be eliminated. I would ask that the NDP members explain why they are so against our country and our people?"
1603,"Madam Speaker, the United States is moving towards a green economy, and that is what Canadians want to do as well. We went to Washington to tell them what Canadians think about the Keystone project and to do this government's job. \lineBreak But this government is still failing to take action on the environment. Canadians do not want a dangerous pipeline. When will the government stop listening to the oil lobby and start listening to Canadians?","Madam Speaker, Canadians are extremely fortunate to have the third largest proven oil reserves in the world, including the oil sands. We intend to develop those. We believe we can do that with the environmental protection that is necessary.  \lineBreak It is unfortunate the NDP opposes all of those things. I do not know why it continues to denigrate our economy, and goes down to Washington trying to damage job creation in this country. We are going to continue to work for Canadians."
1604,"Madam Speaker, the government can shut down debate in the House, but it cannot shut up the opposition. \lineBreak Rather than continuing its lobbying efforts on behalf of big oil companies, the government should do what it promised and actually regulate oil sands emissions. The government's PR campaign is not fooling the Europeans or the Americans. \lineBreak When will the government stop listening only to the oil lobby and do the right thing by introducing emission regulations for oil and gas?","Madam Speaker, the more I hear from the NDP about the economy, the more I understand why my province fell behind with NDP governments. They are disconnected from the real concerns and needs of Canadians. \lineBreak We continue to work to build an economy. Why is the NDP working so hard to destroy Canadian opportunities?"
1605,"Madam Speaker, it falls to MPs on this side of the House to speak up for Canadians who care about the environment because that side is too busy meeting with oil lobbyists. \lineBreak While we are working toward a green economy for the future, it has its own meetings. We found out today that TransCanada lobbyists met with government officials a whopping 56 times since May. It is such a cozy relationship that it is not hard to believe that the government is big oil's number one cheerleader. \lineBreak Why is the government so willing to listen to big oil but not Canadians? Just who does it work for?","Madam Speaker, why do the NDP members not support this country in the development of the economy across the country? Them talking about jobs and about pipelines, and oil sands is ridiculous.  \lineBreak Their former critic calls for a moratorium and actually some of their leadership candidates want to shut down development of the oil sands as well. Why do they not be honest? They are standing up and talking about destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs for Canadians.  \lineBreak We believe we can move ahead with the proper environmental protections and the proper economic development. We are going to continue to do that for Canadians. We are going to continue to provide them with jobs and more opportunities. "
1606,"Madam Speaker, under the government's watch federal spending has shot up 37%. That is 60 billion more dollars a year spent. The Conservatives go around preaching small government, but meanwhile they have squandered the surplus and wasted so much money on gazebos, jails, and pet projects that they are now slashing departmental funding just to make ends meet. They spent Canada into a deficit even before the recession.  \lineBreak I am from a small business background where every penny counts, so I would like to ask, does the government need our help understanding the real priorities of Canadians?","Madam Speaker, it is true that we did increase transfers to the provinces for health care by some 33% after they had been slashed by the opposition when they had their hand at the helm.  \lineBreak We did restore funding for the military, this is true, and we did take action during the economic downturn with stimulus funding. As a result, we have been able to create over 600,000 net new jobs since that downturn. We have been delivering for Canadians.  \lineBreak It is also time now to ensure that we move toward that fiscal balance that is necessary. We are doing that by winding down stimulus spending and by implementing our deficit reduction action plan.  \lineBreak From the opposition, we only hear calls for higher taxes that will kill jobs and opposition to projects that will create jobs. We are delivering for Canadians with more jobs. "
1607,"Madam Speaker, we have known for some time that Canada would win the WTO challenge against the United States protectionist country of origin labelling. We know that this action has cost Canadian livestock producers in excess of $5 billion and has forced some Canadian farmers out of business, yet with that leverage in hand, where are the ministers? Doing a photo op. Ministers should be in the United States capital demanding compensation for Canadian losses and Canadian producers. \lineBreak I ask the minister, has the government even entered negotiations with the United States to secure this victory for farmers?","Madam Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely right: today the WTO panel released its final report which determined the country of origin labelling measures discriminated against foreign livestock and was inconsistent with U.S. WTO trade rules.  \lineBreak  I can also tell the hon. member that we will continue to work on behalf of Canadian producers to supply more Canadian jobs and more opportunity, whether that means going to the WTO or going directly to our trading partners. "
1608,"Madam Speaker, since April 1, three border crossings in my riding—Morses Line, East Pinnacle and Glen Sutton—have had their hours of operation reduced, while other crossings have been completely shut down. In addition to restricting the flow of goods and services as well as people, this also puts jobs at risk. \lineBreak Does the government realize that it is seriously jeopardizing the socio-economic balance of that border region? Will it reverse its decision?","Madam Speaker, the government always carefully considers any decision it makes that may have an impact on the livelihood and trade that our nation engages in. What I am very concerned about is not only the jobs at our border but the hundreds of thousands of jobs that member's party is destroying by the destructive lobbying in the United States against Canadian interests."
1609,"Madam Speaker, under the pretext of cutting costs, the government is penalizing our region. While the economy remains fragile, the government's measures are harmful to farmers, tourists, emergency services that have cross-border reciprocal agreements, and all of the families that feel torn apart by these service reductions. \lineBreak Will the government commit to reopening the border crossings that have been closed and returning the others to their former hours of operation?","Madam Speaker, let us talk about the hundreds of thousands of jobs that member's party, the NDP, wants to shut down. It wants to shut down the seal industry, a vital and important economic activity in many communities. It wants to shut down the forestry sector in B.C. and the aerospace sector in Quebec. It wants to shut down automobile manufacturing in central Canada. It wants to shut down the truck drivers who cross the border every day. It wants to shut down the GM food sector on farms across the country. Why will the member not work with us to create jobs, rather than shutting down our economy?"
1610,"Madam Speaker, once again, they are avoiding the question without answering it. \lineBreak According to Canada Border Services Agency, “As part of its strategic review, the CBSA will be making some changes to its border operations...to ensure maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness.” Meanwhile, the Americans are investing in their border infrastructure. Closing these border crossings makes no sense in terms of economic development and tourism in Canada.  \lineBreak Do the Conservatives realize that they are not walking the talk when it comes to public safety and the economy?","Madam Speaker, what we know is that the New Democrats are focused on shutting down the Canadian economy. They will not have to worry about border crossings; there will be no jobs here. People will not come here for tourism or for economic reasons. The New Democrats want to shut down not only the province of Quebec, they want to shut down industry right across Canada. We will continue in our efforts to maintain our trade relationship with the Americans and the border crossings that are appropriate, to keep that border open."
1611,"Madam Speaker, I will continue asking the same questions.  \lineBreak The Conservatives have let the Americans impose a $5.50 entry fee on Canadians; the Conservatives are going to be losers in the secret agreement on border security; and they are closing border crossings. What is wrong with this picture?  \lineBreak With the reductions in border services and staff, there has been an increase in criminal activities along the border between Dundee and Franklin. Even RCMP officers have said that closing the Franklin border crossing puts public safety at risk. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives suddenly being soft on crime?","Madam Speaker, we have hired hundreds of new CBSA officers. We have increased the number of RCMP officers. I know that when we came into office the Liberals had slashed the training of officers to 300 a year. In 2006, we trained 1,800 RCMP officers. We are concerned about security. We are also concerned about trade. I would ask that member to work with me to ensure that her party, the NDP, works to create jobs and opportunity and works for a safe country."
1612,"Madam Speaker, Service Canada budget cuts mean fewer people are processing employment insurance claims and handling calls. Claimants are often forced to wait well beyond the normal processing time of about 28 days. With no income for six weeks to two months, workers and families are having a hard time putting food on the table and paying bills. \lineBreak My question comes directly from a Service Canada employee in St. John's, Newfoundland. When is the government going to stop talking about automation and actually fix the problems at Service Canada?","Madam Speaker, it is really unfortunate that union leaders, who have clearly convinced the opposition party, are selfishly attempting to ensure that the old, ineffective, labour-intensive method of processing EI claims is what we should be focused on. \lineBreak Our government's top priority is getting Canadians back to work and promoting economic growth. We are committed to providing timely service. As we have said before, no Service Canada offices will be closing nor will there be any cuts to front-line services offered by Service Canada."
1613,"Madam Speaker, those guys just do not get the desperation of the situation. \lineBreak I wonder if the  \lineBreak Across the country, fewer and fewer Canadians are eligible for EI. Almost 60% of unemployed workers in Canada do not qualify. Delays are way beyond anything acceptable. \lineBreak When will the government stop steamrolling ahead with more cuts to Service Canada?","Madam Speaker, as I mentioned before, no Service Canada offices will be closing. As a result of this initiative, there will be no impact on in-person services offered by Service Canada. \lineBreak Automation is important. Making sure we move forward to make sure more Canadians are served in a timely manner is important. We are going to move forward with this process."
1614,"Madam Speaker, Sunday is Universal Children's Day and the government is celebrating with a dismal record on children and families. \lineBreak One in ten children live in poverty while the government offers boutique tax credits to wealthy Canadians. Two out of every five food bank users are children. Food inflation continues to rise and the government offers big tax breaks to corporations. \lineBreak Why does the government refuse to adopt a long-term, comprehensive strategy to eliminate poverty that would actually make it better for children and their families?","Madam Speaker, every action this government takes is to help Canadians and their families become independent and able to contribute to the economy and to their communities. \lineBreak We have had a decline since the peak under the Liberals of 18.4% to 9.5% under this government for children living in low-income families. The poverty rate for children living with single mothers has fallen to an all-time low of 21.5% from the peak of 56% under the Liberals. This government is moving forward on reducing poverty for children. \lineBreak Why does the NDP not support our initiatives that are working?"
1615,"Madam Speaker, these same old lines the government keeps using will not help children. The Conservatives can pat themselves on the back, but the reality is that the number of children living in poverty has not changed. \lineBreak Twenty years ago, the House unanimously passed a motion presented by then-NDP leader, Ed Broadbent, to put an end to child poverty in Canada. At least the government at that time was concerned about children. \lineBreak Why is the current government indifferent towards children, especially children living in poverty?","Madam Speaker, the average Canadian family now spends $3,000 less per year in taxes. Those are funds that Canadians can use to invest in their family and their own children, thanks to this Conservative government.  \lineBreak Whether it is enhancing the national child benefit, or enhancing the child tax benefit, this government is working for Canadian families and their children. Why does the NDP not support these initiatives?"
1616,"Madam Speaker, the story of first nations education in Canada is a tragedy of lost generations. Still only 35% of first nations children are graduating from high schools. Preliminary reports from the national panel on first nations education made clear the shameful reality that often first nations students do not go to school because there is no running water in the school and the building itself is unsafe. \lineBreak Will the government confirm today that yesterday's commitment to safe drinking water in first nations homes will also address the urgent priority of first nations schools?","Madam Speaker, we are finding innovative solutions to improve the quality of education for first nations. We have a joint action plan with the national chief. The K to 12 panel is doing some very good work. We have also invested in a major way in school renovation and school construction across the country. We built or repaired 100 schools and work is under way on over 100 more. The economic action plan was a big part of this."
1617,"Madam Speaker, when will the government finally follow the advice of the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel and stop playing judge and jury for the Federal Court of Appeal? Will the government finally listen to the Canadian Bar Association, Parliament's lawyer, and the opposition and wait for the courts to do their work?  \lineBreak When will Conservatives allow the courts to function independently and recognize that their political agenda comes second to their constitutional duties?","Madam Speaker, I would respond to the question with a question. When will the NDP understand that this is about fundamental accountability and transparency for each and every Canadian? Hard-working Canadians contribute their tax dollars to this government. Many of those dollars go toward the support of the public broadcaster. All we are seeking from the public broadcaster is transparency and accountability because families in my riding and the member's riding deserve nothing less than transparency from the public broadcaster. "
1618,"Madam Speaker, we, too, are in favour of as much transparency as possible at the CBC, but being accountable does not mean ignoring political and legal processes. The actions of the member for  \lineBreak This precedent is contrary to our institutions and to the separation of powers. The government is setting itself above the constitutional role of the House. The Canadian Constitution also applies to the Conservative caucus. Will it respect the separation of legislative and judicial powers?","Madam Speaker, I was here in the previous parliament when the previous Speaker ruled that Parliament was indeed supreme. It is a ruling that has in fact been reviewed in parliaments around the world that have similar systems to us. \lineBreak I would simply say for the member that the average family of four in my riding and in his riding contributes the equivalent of a week's worth of groceries to the CBC. Do those members not believe that those hard-working families deserve transparency and accountability from the CBC? They deserve to see how their money is being spent. They deserve nothing less from their public broadcaster."
1619,"Madam Speaker, recently I visited a grade 9 class of Cabot High in northern Cape Breton. Its number one ask of the federal government is to pay its share to finish its rink. Members of the community have put up mortgages, the junior hockey league has held a fundraiser and a community over 500 kilometres away has donated equipment. Two other levels of government have stepped up to the plate.  \lineBreak Muskoka got its rink. Does northern Cape Breton have to host a G8 summit to get the rink finished?","Madam Speaker, a few things need to be corrected. Since 2006, over $160 million in funding has been dedicated toward 1,350 projects within Cape Breton and the Mulgrave area of Nova Scotia. This is the first thing that needs to go on the record. \lineBreak Our economic action plan alone has represented $9.6 million invested in 54 projects throughout Cape Breton. The federal government has been standing up for Cape Breton."
1620,"Madam Speaker, the government is abandoning the veterans who have served Canada. By negotiating to transfer to the Quebec government the last federal hospital that treats veterans exclusively, Veterans Affairs will lose 1,300 jobs.  \lineBreak How will veterans receive the services they are entitled to? How can the minister tell our veterans, who so proudly wore the uniform, that their government is abandoning them?","Madam Speaker, our government is taking action for veterans and our men and women in uniform. Our government has increased benefits to veterans. \lineBreak The Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec have entered into preliminary discussions for the possible transfer of Ste.

These aircraft are repainted every six years and there is no current plan to change the paint scheme for any Airbus aircraft."
1625,"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian economy faces many challenges, and one of them is the infrastructure deficit.  \lineBreak New federal rules, like the waste water regulations, are being imposed on municipalities without any new investments. This is an opportunity right now to inject new money into the economy and fix some major infrastructure problems. Municipalities cannot do it on their own. \lineBreak Why not stimulate the economy by helping municipalities to meet new water standards?","Mr. Speaker, waste water regulations are being put forward and designed to ensure that Canadians have safe water when and where they need it. Those regulations are responsible in the way in which we are doing it. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak It is true that we need to have effective regulations. We do have to have responsible regulations. It would be nice if the NDP offered solutions and supported both."
1626,"Mr. Speaker, 72,000 jobs were lost in October alone. The cost of living continues to rise and household debt has hit a record high. How do you expect families to save for their retirement when they have to pay off their credit cards and are having trouble finding work? This government has the gall to say that its plan will help millions of Canadians. What is this government doing? Nothing, except helping its friends in high places. \lineBreak When will this government finally trim the fat from its friends and come up with a real recovery plan for the Canadian economy to create jobs here in Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind the hon. member that we did come up with a real economic action plan but his party voted against that. We put forward a second economic action plan and those members voted against that, too. \lineBreak I will refer exactly to what the member's question was about. We are putting forward a pooled registered pension plan that would actually be available, accessible and economical for over 60% of the workforce in this country that does not have a workplace pension plan right now. I certainly hope those members will not vote against that."
1627,"Mr. Speaker, the reviews are in on the  \lineBreak When will the out-of-touch government stop playing retirement roulette and strengthen the one pension plan families can rely on, which is the CPP? It promised to strengthen it. Why does it not do so? Why does it not strengthen the CPP?","Mr. Speaker, we actually have been working with the provinces to develop a plan that works for both the provincially-regulated and federally-regulated. Let me read a quote from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. It stated: \lineBreak That is a quote worth listening to."
1628,"Mr. Speaker, the sovereign debt problem keeps rolling across Europe, from Greece to Italy and now Spain. In the polarized politics of the United States, they are headed into yet another damaging game of fiscal chicken. Global economic risks are rising and here in Canada our growth rate, job numbers and job quality are all getting worse. \lineBreak Still, on January 1, the government will increase EI payroll taxes by another $600 million. At this critical moment, will the government listen to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and stop this job-killing Conservative tax increase?","Mr. Speaker, the truth is our government's record is crystal clear. We are the government that has lowered taxes more than any other government across the country and we have done so in ways that have benefited the Canadian economy. In fact, Canada's tax regime is, indeed, the envy of the world because we have the most competitive tax rate.  \lineBreak The member opposite mentioned things on the exterior that we cannot control and things within Canada that we can control. One thing we can control is the vote that will take place tonight with regard to the next phase of Canada's action plan. If he believes in lower taxes, he will stand with this government and lower taxes on Canadians."
1629,"Mr. Speaker, to be clear, Liberals reduced EI premiums every year for 12 consecutive years, for a total saving of $4,000 for every employee, $5,500 for every employer, a Liberal tax cut in total of $60 billion. The Conservatives have done the opposite, raising job-killing payroll taxes just when jobs are most vulnerable. \lineBreak Why will the government not hold the line on payroll taxes and help create jobs instead of spending billions upon billions for bigger jails and untendered fighter jets?","Mr. Speaker, the member for  \lineBreak Specifically with regard to the question of EI, we have put forward a project to ensure that 500,000 businesses that want to employ Canadians will have tax relief in this budget. The Liberals stand opposed to that. If they believe in it, they should stand and support our budget tonight, this week and moving forward to lower taxes on businesses."
1630,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives increase EI premiums by $1.2 billion and then give back $160 million. It is hardly a fair deal. \lineBreak It is all about priorities. The Conservatives have ballooned the size of the federal government by more than one-third. Their annual program spending is up by $65 billion, a whopping 37%, and more than half of that increase happened before, not because of any recession. Still family incomes are stagnant. Most Canadians do not have a decent pension. The gap is growing between the very wealthy and everybody else. \lineBreak Why do bigger jails seem more important to the government—",The hon.

No line has been more bizarre than at least “every penny was well spent”. We know that $3,000 was spent to put up a chandelier, $1,500 to move a bed and a new fridge just for the flowers. No wonder the Muskoka maverick thought he got a good deal when he shelled out $100,000 for a gazebo. \lineBreak Will the minister explain why $2 million of taxpayer money was spent on renovating his friend's hotel?","Mr. Speaker, Canada hosted the world's leaders for an important summit.

The summit is already paying dividends on important issues, such as maternal and child health initiatives, and that member should support those initiatives."
1634,"Mr. Speaker, thanks to the NDP we now know that the G8 summit resulted in an incredible waste of public money, perhaps the worst since the sponsorship scandal. Canadians want to know why no one has been punished. In addition to the gazebos, Olympic-sized skating rinks, fake media centres—there is no end to the list—we have just learned that the Deerhurst resort received millions of dollars in public money to make cosmetic changes that cost us an arm and a leg. The government paid exorbitant amounts to move a bed or a chandelier and of course, once again, taxpayers footed the $2 million bill. \lineBreak Can the President of the Treasury Board explain to Canadians what was the cost value of the G8 fiasco that was held in his riding?

When hosting the leaders of the world's great economies, it is expected that some adjustments must be made for their accommodations. Every invoice was reviewed by professional public servants, as is always the case, before the money went out the door."
1635,"Mr. Speaker, history never repeats itself, but it sometimes follows a similar script. \lineBreak It seems that the President of the Treasury Board was not the only one to profit from the G8 summit in his riding. The Deerhurst resort also won the G8 lottery by getting $2 million in free renovations. Less than nine months later, this hotel was sold for $26 million. We know why: because it did not have to pay for the renovations itself. \lineBreak Is that the Conservatives' tax plan: take public money and distribute it to its friends in the private sector?

1636,"Mr. Speaker, the UN estimates that over 3,500 civilians have been killed in Syria during the government's crackdown. Today the Security Council is debating sanctions against Syria. For Canada, failure to win a seat on the Security Council is not an excuse for inaction. \lineBreak  Will the government reach out to Russia and China to join others in the international community working to end this regime's violence against its own people?","Mr. Speaker, the campaign of terror and violence against the Syrian people must stop. Canada again calls on President al-Assad to step down immediately. \lineBreak  Canada stands with the Syrian people in their efforts to secure freedom and democracy. Our government will continue to work with our allies to bring diplomatic pressure to the Syrian government, including bringing forth stronger economic sanctions."
1637,"Mr. Speaker, we need more than just promises and rhetoric. \lineBreak The sanctions imposed against Syria in October were supposed to send a strong message to the Bashar al-Assad regime, but Suncor, which is working with the Syrian state oil company on a $1.2 billion project, said that its operations were not affected. \lineBreak Will the government ensure that the new sanctions against Syria will prevent its friends from doing business as usual when millions of civilians are being killed?","Mr. Speaker, Canada has taken decisive action by imposing sanctions that directly target members of the current Syrian regime and those who provide it with support. We are currently working with our allies to bring diplomatic pressure to bear. We will be bringing forth further stronger economic sanctions."
1638,"Mr. Speaker, the government has taken arrogance and secrecy to a new low. Without letting Canadians know, the Conservatives are throwing half a billion dollars into a new U.S. military satellite. We, in the House, had to find out about this program from the media. \lineBreak On what grounds does the government feel free to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on military projects, without telling anyone? Would the minister please advise the House and Canadians today what this satellite will be used for?","Mr. Speaker , our missions in Afghanistan and Libya have proven that advance secure communications is critical to the success of modern day military operations. The Canadian contribution to this international partnership would guarantee our Canadian Forces the capacity to communicate securely and officially during operations when lives are at stake. \lineBreak Our investment fits with the Canadian Forces' existing budget and will result in supporting and creating skilled Canadian jobs across the country."

They deserve to know, and we all deserve to know, why the Conservatives are pursuing another risky military project shrouded in mystery. How many more boondoggles before the government finally wises up?","Mr. Speaker, neither is it a secret nor is it a boondoggle. Negotiations on this memorandum of understanding continue.

New federal environmental rules force municipalities to treat raw sewage and we welcome that. However, these regulations mean additional costs to communities that are already strained with aging infrastructure. \lineBreak The government has known for years that these new regulations would force municipalities to spend enormous dollars to fix their treatment plants, but it has yet to come to the table to assist. \lineBreak Could the minister indicate when he plans to announce an infrastructure plan to clean up Canada's harbours?","Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleague that our government has invested more than $3 billion in waste water management and waste water infrastructure, and on top of that have increased and made permanent more than $2 billion a year in terms of gas tax refunds aimed at infrastructure. \lineBreak The Charlottetown share of the infrastructure money from the gas tax rebate will be $3 million annually. Municipalities and the provinces have to do their part to make waste water management their priority."

We are pleased to see proposed regulations for the waste water from our towns and villages, but the government has forgotten to provide those towns and villages with the necessary means to comply with those regulations. \lineBreak  The mayor and council of the second largest municipality in Nova Scotia are risking imprisonment because they do not have the means to pay for new sewage treatment plants. \lineBreak Why has the government not come up with a funding formula for water infrastructure in Canada?

1644,"Mr. Speaker, the minister can feed us the same old lines, but that cannot hide the cracks showing in the Conservative ranks. \lineBreak The Conservatives are wondering the same things as all Canadians. How can the government continue to export asbestos even though the risks are known? Why is the government abandoning workers in regions that produce asbestos? \lineBreak Will the government present a plan to help these regions make the economic transition?","Mr. Speaker, we are talking here about safe use, which means risk management. Recent scientific studies have shown that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment that is properly regulated, either at the national or international level."

1646,"Mr. Speaker, when will the government realize that science is real and it cannot actually be spun like a talking point? There is a hole in the ozone over the Arctic, twice the size of Ontario, and action on the ozone is fundamentally necessary right now. \lineBreak Instead, we learn that senior government officials are signing memos verifying the importance of ozone protection programs in Canada one minute and then justifying Conservative cuts as streamlining and optimization.  \lineBreak When will the government get its act together and realize that streamlining the Department of the Environment hurts all of us?","Mr. Speaker, my colleague is quoting a media story which took a particular quote out of context.  \lineBreak As I said, Environment Canada will continue to monitor ozone.

Quebec refuses to pay the costs associated with this Conservative ideology, which is mocking Quebec's 40 years of experience when it comes to long-term protection of the public.

Why has there been no action on creating the jobs that these families need?","Mr. Speaker, the real question is why the NDP has voted against every initiative we have to help families get back to work and look after their children. \lineBreak Those members voted against the universal child care benefit. They voted against an increase in the national child benefit. They also voted against the WITB, the working income tax benefit, that is there to help families get over the welfare wall and encourage them to get back to work. \lineBreak Why is it that the NDP will not help workers work?"
1658,"Mr. Speaker, unhappy that Quebec is opposed to their justice bill, the Conservatives are turning to blind partisanship. Senator Boisvenu, an unelected representative, is doing the dirty work. \lineBreak For a week now, he has been attacking the credibility of the Barreau du Québec, questioning the competence of minister Jean-Marc Fournier and ridiculing unanimous decisions by Quebec's National Assembly. \lineBreak My question is simple, and I hope to receive a very clear answer. Does the ","Mr. Speaker, we have been very consistent. The bill that is before Parliament has been here in some cases for four years. It specifically targets those individuals in the business of trafficking in drugs and those individuals who would sexually exploit children. \lineBreak Canadians from coast to coast gave us a mandate and we are following through on that mandate. I am very proud of our stand in that area."
1659,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' strategy to implement measures and make others pay for them is not a sustainable strategy. For example, employment insurance eligibility criteria that are too stringent are forcing people to seek provincial social assistance. The waste water treatment regulations are forcing municipalities to buy equipment that they cannot afford. The Conservative crime strategy is to force the provinces to build prisons. \lineBreak When will the government foot the bill for its own ambitions?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member spoke about a number of files but let us be clear: we are making sure we take a responsible approach with each province. The provinces are responsible for delivering the goods on the ground. That is why we are working with the provinces when it comes to crime, investment in waste water treatment and other things. We are working with the provinces, not against them. Our history, our heritage and our commitment in these matters clearly demonstrates that such is currently the case, and we will continue to work with the provinces."

Communication is a critical aspect of our commitment to those men and women."
1661,"Mr. Speaker, the 2014 Canada health accord negotiations will finally begin this week, discussions the NDP has been calling for since before the election. \lineBreak Universal health care is dear to Canadians. It is the single most important element of social and economic justice in the country, a symbol of the Canadian value of taking care of each other. \lineBreak My question is for the ","Mr. Speaker, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that health care is probably the most important service that governments provide to the Canadian people. The Canadian people value that service. \lineBreak Obviously, all governments are struggling with the increased costs we see over time. That is a discussion that I think will engage all Canadians over the next couple of years."

All governments are struggling with the increased costs and that is an issue we will discuss when we talk about how to maintain these programs in the future. "
1663,"Mr. Speaker, since the last accord was signed there has been little progress on wait times or primary care reform, a failure to hire enough doctors and nurses, a failure on pharmaceuticals, a failure on home care and a near complete failure on reporting results. \lineBreak Where is the plan for improving health care now? \lineBreak With two years still to go, will the ","Mr. Speaker, I think most Canadians recognize that the delivery of health care is principally a provincial responsibility. The principal role of the federal government has been to support it through the transfer system. Of course, under this government, we are giving a record amount of money for health care. \lineBreak I agree that there are some gaps in terms of accountability and results, and those are things we are encouraging the provinces to look at as we approach 2014."
1664,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report speaks of ""chronic and widespread"" mismanagement that contradicts the government's claim about the economic action plan. \lineBreak The government cannot say how many jobs were created after having spent $47 billion of Canadians' money. \lineBreak The program was so badly monitored that no one knows if it was effective. We now know that 72,000 full-time jobs were lost last month, thanks to the policies of this government. \lineBreak Now that the truth is out, when will this government put aside bogus and unsubstantiated job claims and take real and immediate action to create jobs here in Canada for Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, the positive impact of the economic action plan, which the official opposition voted against, can be seen in the almost 600,000 net new jobs for Canadians since the end of the recession. It was a good plan. It worked. It is regrettable that the NDP chose to vote against it. \lineBreak Here is what the Auditor General actually said:"
1665,"Mr. Speaker, it is not bogus job claims that will get the government out of this mess. \lineBreak Here is what the Auditor General said: \lineBreak The government and the Canadian public cannot compare the goals of the Conservative plan with the outcome.That is actually what good managers do: goals, outcomes, matching it up. They did not do it. There is no monitoring. There is no transparency. \lineBreak Why the lack of monitoring? Why the lack of transparency? Why did the government not get the job done?","Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague has indicated, this economy has created nearly 600,000 net new jobs under this government, under the economic action plan, which, as my colleague, the minister, indicated, has been praised by auditors general, and Canadians agree with that. They gave us not only strong praise but a strong mandate to protect and complete Canada's economic recovery. \lineBreak They, on the other side, of course, call for higher taxes that would kill jobs and hurt the economy. Our plan is to keep taxes low, to focus on jobs and to grow the economy. I think Canadians agree with us."
1666,"Mr. Speaker, some quotes from the Auditor General: “Farmers can wait up to two years for a payment”; the government does not know “if a visa was issued to someone who was in fact inadmissible”. In terms of military equipment maintenance, “the department does not track the full costs of maintenance and repair activities”. \lineBreak Why is this ","Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, thanks to the government, the Canadian economy has nearly 600,000 more jobs. \lineBreak We accept the findings of the Auditor General. The Auditor General has made some good findings and some good recommendations, which we are already working on. \lineBreak  The fact is that when we look at the state of the economy and the state of our moves to ensure we are a help rather than a hindrance, this government has gotten it right and the Auditor General agrees with us on that."
1667,"Mr. Speaker, today the Auditor General revealed that Health Canada can take more than two years to evaluate safety issues associated with the use of prescription drugs. The report also highlights that Health Canada is falling short on conflict of interest rules. This is completely unacceptable when so many new drugs are available and Canadians need adequate, timely and transparent information.  \lineBreak Drug safety is important to all Canadians. Exactly how does the government and the minister plan to reduce the delays that are happening? We have not heard anything specific from the minister today. I ask her to tell the House how she plans to reduce these delays.","Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, my department is implementing the advice of the Auditor General. The Auditor General was very clear in his statements today that there were no cases of conflict of interest; however, we do agree that additional conflict of interest rules should apply to those who review drugs."
1668,"Mr. Speaker, we still have not been given an answer. Once again, the government has missed the boat. \lineBreak The Auditor General said that Health Canada does not have a uniform mechanism for monitoring clinical trials of prescription drugs for the most vulnerable, such as children. Other countries receive industry data on adverse drug reactions in children. However, the Conservatives have not bothered with this requirement, which would protect Canadians' health. That is irresponsible. \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, again, I agree with the Auditor General's recommendations on the department in strengthening its approach to clinical trials. New procedures are being put in place to improve transparency, and to better monitor clinical trials and adverse reaction reports.  \lineBreak To strengthen the pharmaceutical drug program, a new IT system has also been put in place to help better identify potential safety concerns. The audit is from 2009-10, so we have acted on a number of the recommendations already."
1669,"Mr. Speaker, this morning, the Auditor General repeated what the NDP has been condemning at National Defence, namely that the department is broken. Decisions are made without having the necessary information on long-term costs, there is no proper follow-up on overall maintenance and repairs, and major contracts are awarded to a limited number of suppliers. \lineBreak Is the government going to continue to have its head in the clouds, ignore the facts and keep telling us that everything is fine? ","Mr. Speaker, we appreciate and thank the Auditor General for his work. The department has accepted his recommendations and is already addressing each concern. A comprehensive plan is in place with activities under way, and our government has committed to providing our brave men and women in uniform the equipment and support necessary to do their jobs safely and effectively."
1670,"Mr. Speaker, three elections promising fiscal responsibility followed by six years of fiscal mismanagement and the government continues to miss opportunities to save money and improve accountability. The Auditor General said there is a gap between the money needed for military maintenance and what is available. \lineBreak Does the Auditor General's discovery of mismanagement come as a complete surprise to the minister, or can he explain to Canadians why his department is failing to give our soldiers properly maintained military equipment?","Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, we appreciate and thank the Auditor General for his work. Many of the recommendations have already been implemented. We are working actively on all of these issues and have been for quite some time. We intend to continue to ensure that our men and women receive the best equipment necessary to do their jobs and do so keeping in mind taxpayers' concerns about all spending."
1671,"Mr. Speaker, in 2005 when talking about the CAIS program, the  \lineBreak The Auditor General reported today that some farmers are waiting up to two years for payment. When will the government fix this broken program and make it work for all Canadian farmers?","What the member opposite should recognize, Mr. Speaker, is that the vast majority of the AgriStability program is delivered at the provincial level. What we do is transfer moneys when there are bills presented from the provinces. If he has a problem, he should probably take it up with his counterparts in Ontario."
1672,"That is the off-load of the day, I think, Mr. Speaker. \lineBreak The AG reported that the tobacco transition program failed because it was rushed out the door and had loopholes as big as a combine. By 2010 the number of tobacco farmers had doubled. There were $300 million spent to reduce tobacco production and yet it did the exact opposite. \lineBreak When will the government stop mismanaging important agricultural files and what has it done to get to the bottom of this fiasco?"," Mr. Speaker, we welcome the input from the Auditor General on this particular valuable program for farmers in Ontario. The member opposite should know one does not combine tobacco. That is why New Democrats have no real good farm programs. They get it all mixed up and completely turned around. \lineBreak Again, what we did was come to the aid of the tobacco growers in Ontario. We kept them fluid. We allowed them to transition into other programs and the province has taken over the responsibility of licensing tobacco production."
1673,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General today reported that immigration officials are not adequately managing health and safety risks regarding visas. He said that officials lack the right tools and training, and decisions are rarely reviewed. Health screening has not changed in 50 years and one key manual was last updated in 1999. The audit concluded that we need a better strategy to protect the health and safety of Canadians. CIC has to get with the times. \lineBreak Will the minister finally implement the quality management system recommended over 11 years ago?","Mr. Speaker, I am truly delighted to hear the NDP, for the very first time, raise a concern about security and health screening in the immigration system. I would like to congratulate the member for  \lineBreak We accept all of the Auditor General's recommendations.

1674,"Mr. Speaker, as one committed for some time to expanded sanctions on the Iranian regime, particularly in the financial and energy sectors, I am pleased that the government has now acted. However, as the government knows, the Iranian Islamic revolutionary guard corps has emerged as the epicentre of the nuclear weaponization program of international terrorism from Argentina to Afghanistan and massive domestic repression. \lineBreak  Will the government list the Iranian Islamic revolutionary guard corps as a terrorist entity under Canadian law as unanimously recommended also by the foreign affairs committee, which tabled its report in the House?","Mr. Speaker, our latest expansion of sanctions against Iran prohibit almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government. They add individuals and entities to the list of designated persons and expand the list of prohibited goods. We are taking aggressive action to cover the known leadership of the Iranian Islamic revolutionary guard corps and block virtually all transactions with Iran, including those with the central bank."
1675,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's Information Commissioner has warned the government that its bill to scrap the long gun registry and delete millions of records would violate the letter and the spirit of the Library and Archives of Canada Act. This irresponsible and illegal move would get rid of records of not only shotguns and rifles but also semi-automatic and assault rifles. \lineBreak The association representing Canadian archivists wrote the  \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives willing to break the law by destroying millions of records?","Actually, Mr. Speaker, we are changing the law in order to get rid of the long gun registry, which is comprised of data that targets law-abiding Canadian citizens, including hunters, sport shooters and others. \lineBreak We have consistently opposed this wasteful and ineffective measure which does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. We do not want to keep records on law-abiding citizens the way that the NDP does. We are carrying out the promise that we made to the Canadian people."

1677,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that today is National Housing Day. I am pointing this out because there is nothing to celebrate. This government does not have a long-term strategy for affordable housing. Right now, 1.5 million Canadian households are living in inadequate housing and over 150,000 people are living on the streets. For them, every day is a day without affordable housing. This day reminds us of the government's inaction.  \lineBreak Why is this government complacent about the fact that there are so many families who do not have decent housing? ","Mr. Speaker, we have invested a lot of money to help people in need of affordable housing. For example, as part of our economic action plan, we have invested $2 billion, which has helped to build or renovate 14,000 houses. That means that 14,000 families have benefited from our efforts. Unfortunately, the NDP voted against all these initiatives."
1678,"Mr. Speaker, 14,000 renovations are not new homes.  \lineBreak Today is National Housing Day, another reminder that the out-of-touch government is failing families. A staggering 1.5 million Canadian households are at risk unless the government commits to more affordable housing. Aboriginal communities are living in tents, seniors are still paying for mortgages, families are falling deeper into debt. Yet the government's so-called plan is too little too late. \lineBreak When will the government get serious about our housing crisis? When will the government implement a real national, affordable housing strategy?","Mr. Speaker, the real question is this. When will the NDP stop complaining and start doing something to actually help those in need? \lineBreak The facts are that we have 14,000 projects, which is more than 14,000 families, and 1,200 alone were renovations. There are new projects and new builds. We had specific funding for affordable housing for seniors, the disabled, for those off-reserve and on-reserve. The NDP members voted against helping those people every time. Shame on them. They have no credibility on this issue."
1679,"Mr. Speaker, while our Conservative government is focused on jobs, the NDP is bashing the Canadian economy. \lineBreak  First, the NDP tries to hike taxes on Canadians from a $10 billion a year hike on employers to a GST hike on families and more. Second, the NDP travels to Washington to join fellow left-wing radicals to attack our country's economy and good Canadian jobs. Finally, last night, the NDP shockingly voted against implementing the next phase of Canada's economic action plan. \lineBreak Could the finance minister please explain what the NDP tried to kill last night?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the erudite question about budget voting.  \lineBreak Last night the budget was voted on at third reading and it was passed in this place, but without the support of NDP members. They walked away from the job creation tax credit for small business. They voted against the family caregiver tax credit. They voted against the children's arts tax credit. They voted against the volunteer firefighter tax credit. They voted against tax relief for the manufacturing sector and making the gas tax fund permanent for municipalities in Canada."
1680,"Mr. Speaker, the Cape Breton regional municipality has a major problem cleaning up its waste water systems. It has a declining population and a $100 million debt. With the previous Liberal government's tax rebate, the mayor and council have put many new systems in place. However, it is not enough. The province has stated that it will not give any more money and the Conservative government has unfair deadlines. \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, I was mayor during the time of the former government.

1681,"Mr. Speaker, the government is imposing sanctions on Iran, but at the end of September, it allowed Mahmoud Reza Kavari to enter the country. He was the head of Bank Melli, which was involved in a financial scandal. \lineBreak I think the government needs to be reminded that Bank Melli has been on the government's blacklist since 2010 because it is suspected of funding Iran's nuclear program. \lineBreak It took a month to launch an investigation. \lineBreak Why is the government allowing Canada to become a refuge for people who fund the Iranian regime?","Mr. Speaker, first of all, the hon. member must understand that under the Privacy Act, the government and its ministers cannot comment on specific cases. \lineBreak That said, I have seen the media reports saying that this man received Canadian citizenship in 2005. Obviously, we have launched an investigation regarding foreigners who fraudulently obtained Canadian citizenship, and we intend to review the period in question."
1682,"Mr. Speaker, our government is defending Canada's interests around the world, and why would we not? That is what we were elected to do and that is what Canadians expect us to do. Meanwhile, the NDP consistently tries to undermine Canada's interests, whether that is in Europe or whether that is in the United States.  \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, last week the NDP refused to attend a forum organized by a union representing 200,000 oil and gas workers.

With an aging workforce, aging fishers, we need to position the fishing industry to attract new and younger fishers to that industry. \lineBreak Just last week, for example, I was in Newfoundland to announce the government's investment in an $18 million program to restructure the lobster industry. Fishermen were not nearly as downbeat as the member opposite suggested. In fact, they were very positive and said such things as, “It's a good day for the lobster industry in general and for the province”."
1684,"Mr. Speaker, Minister Fournier came away from this morning's meeting with his federal counterpart empty-handed. The federal minister told him that he did not have confidence in the statistics provided by Quebec, the expertise of Quebec's lawyers or the opinion of the Barreau du Québec. \lineBreak Furthermore, a survey revealed this morning that only 22% of Quebeckers believe that Bill  \lineBreak Is this the federal government's idea of open federalism?

Therefore, I have a $.5 billion question for the minister. \lineBreak Now that he has had 24 hours to find the right briefing notes, can he tell us whether the industrial benefits of Canada's participation in the U.S. military's Satcom network will be subject to ITAR and buy American? For his and our edification, can he tell the House the meaning and significance of the ITAR provisions in the context of this contract?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know if sarcasm will advance the legitimacy of what we are doing in this government. \lineBreak Operations in Afghanistan and Libya have proven that an advanced secure exchange of information is critical to the success of modern military operations. The Canadian contribution to this international partnership will guarantee our Canadian Forces access to high capacity military communications for the future. \lineBreak Our investment fits with the Canadian Forces existing budget and 100% of its value will be invested in creating skilled Canadian jobs across the country."

1689,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General makes it crystal clear that the government failed to meet its own standards for reviewing the safety and effectiveness of drugs at all levels, pre-clinical, clinical trials and post-market risk assessment. \lineBreak In fact, the Auditor General found that the department takes over two years to inform the public of unsafe drugs on the market.  \lineBreak Will the minister admit that this failure endangers patients' lives and will she commit now to provide the funds and resources necessary to report drug risks to the public promptly?","Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we agree with the Auditor General's findings. \lineBreak My department is making improvements on how Health Canada responds to safety issues regarding drugs on the market.

That is a recipe for disaster. \lineBreak Why is the government more interested in funding empty private executive jets than in keeping our skies safe for Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, the safety of Canadians when they fly is an absolute priority for Transport Canada. Canada has one of the safest aviation systems in the world and we are very proud of it. \lineBreak  As I said before, Transport Canada already sold eight of its aircraft and it will continue to review all the options for the best way to use the tax dollars of our country."
1702,"Mr. Speaker, rather than trying to sell us an aircraft that does not work, the Conservatives should focus on doing a better job of managing those we already have. \lineBreak Transport Canada's nine Citation aircraft are either being flown with no passengers on board or sitting on the ground, at a cost of $5 million a year. Even the Canadian Taxpayers Federation is criticizing this poor management. \lineBreak This government is going to save money by cutting services for families. Why not get rid of these useless aircraft instead?","Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, our government has significantly decreased the use of government and Transport Canada aircraft. We have sold eight of these aircraft and we will continue to review all the options because we always rigorously manage the tax dollars of this country. For us, it is not a matter of instilling fear about airline safety. Canada has one of the safest aviation systems in the world. We will continue."
1703,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have a real love affair with jets. \lineBreak First, the  \lineBreak Will the government finally set an example by reducing its own spending?","Mr. Speaker, in the previous question, the hon. member said that planes were flying around empty, and now he is saying that they are being used to transport public servants. He needs to get his facts straight. \lineBreak These planes are used for the benefit of Transport Canada and for the benefit of security. We have sold eight of these aircraft. We will continue to very rigorously manage Canadians' money. In particular, we will continue to ensure the safety and security of air travel in this great country."
1704,"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report clearly indicates that the Department of National Defence does not have a comprehensive view of its military procurement processes. \lineBreak We are now learning that the F-35 communications system will not be compatible with the systems used in other fighter jets and by troops on the ground. \lineBreak My question is simple, and I hope that the minister will answer it this time. When will the government finally launch an open, transparent bidding process to replace the CF-18s?","Mr. Speaker, contrary to the member's misrepresentation of the facts, I am pleased to correct the record. Canada is scheduled to receive its entire delivery of F-35 aircraft equipped with the ability to locate and communicate with aircraft, ships and ground forces. This means that all Canada's F-35s will not only be capable of operating overseas the moment we get them, but will be able to communicate with other aircraft and know where friendly ground units are well in advance of deployment on operations. Our plans continue to be on track."
1705,"Mr. Speaker, it is crucial to the safety of our troops on the ground that a fighter jet be able to communicate with them. This is no joke. \lineBreak This situation again shows that the government does not know what is happening with this file. With the communication, safety and durability problems with the F-35s, this government is putting our soldiers' lives in danger. \lineBreak When will the government finally stop defending its program and unveil its infamous plan B?","Mr. Speaker, that is just absolutely idle rhetoric. In any event, the member opposite is engaging in fearmongering about the importance of the F-35 program, a program that is critical to managing Canada's sovereignty, supporting our military men and women and creating aerospace jobs for Canadians, in spite of the chirping from across the aisle."
1706,"Mr. Speaker, this is not just about another procurement boondoggle, this is about the safety of our troops. We ask a lot of our troops and we in the House in return owe them the very best chance to return home safely to their families. However, the government continues to rush headlong to purchase a fighter jet that cannot even communicate with the ground forces it is supposed to support.  \lineBreak When will the government stop playing politics with the safety of our troops? When will it admit it made a mistake and put this contract out to tender?","Mr. Speaker, there was a competition with respect to the F-35. The issue is that the F-35 won out over other aircraft. It is the fifth generation, the best we can provide to our men and women to enable them to complete their missions and to return safely at the end of those missions."
1707,"Mr. Speaker, it is not just Minister Fournier who felt shortchanged yesterday at his meeting with the  \lineBreak My question is simple. Is the Minister of Justice prepared to make amendments to ensure not just the immediate protection but also the long-term protection of our society? That is what we want.","Mr. Speaker, the "
1708,"Mr. Speaker, we miss Brian Murphy and Claudette Bradshaw a lot. They focused on the people rather than on demonstrating their arrogance as the Conservatives have been doing. \lineBreak The reality is that right now we have immediate safety. We are in favour of immediate safety, but if there is no long-term safety, then there is no rehabilitation. The Conservatives have not conducted any research and they do not have any expertise. What Quebeckers and Canadians want is for amendments to be made so that the system works. In the days of Brian Mulroney, this minister agreed that the Quebec model should be protected. How did he become such a dinosaur?","Mr. Speaker, the people of Quebec support the safe streets and communities bill. Every day, they wait for these important measures to be implemented to protect them. Quebeckers and this party understand what safety means. The word safety is not part of the Liberals' vocabulary."
1709,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak If so, I would ask that minister to rise in this House and tell us if he at least tried to explain to his colleague, the justice minister, what co-operative federalism means.","Mr. Speaker, contrary to what Minister Fournier may have misinterpreted, Bill C-10 was based on Justice Nunn's report and—"

1711,"Mr. Speaker, the evidence keeps mounting. The government is failing Canadian families. Campaign 2000's annual report card shows that 1 in 10 Canadian children still live in poverty. Household debt is at an all time high, while low-and middle-income families have to work more hours just to get by.  \lineBreak As a country, we need to do better. What is the government going to do to make life more affordable for Canadian families struggling just to make ends meet?","Mr. Speaker, we have done an awful lot. It is too bad that the NDP members did not actually support any of our efforts to help struggling Canadian families. For example, they did not support the $100 a month in universal child care benefits for parents of children under the age of six to help them choose the child care that the family needed. \lineBreak The NDP members did not support the introduction of the working income tax benefit to help poorer families get over the welfare wall so they could work and look after their families. Nor did they accept any of the tax cuts that we brought in, so that families could enjoy, on average, $3,000 a year more in their pockets instead of the government coffers."
1712,"Mr. Speaker, what the NDP voted against was keeping seniors in poverty. We voted against inaction on child poverty and we voted against the short-sighted policies of the Conservative government. \lineBreak The reality is that most families need to work two jobs just to make ends meet, yet nearly three million children do not have access to regulated child care. An affordable high-quality child care program can pay for itself. Just look at Quebec.  \lineBreak Why will the government not move forward on a real national child care plan that actually reduces child poverty? Why will it not act?","Mr. Speaker, we did that. It was one of the very first things we did back in 2006. We introduced the universal child care benefit which is $100 a month to parents of each child under the age of six, so that they could choose the form of child care that best meets their needs. Maybe they live in the city and want to access traditional day care, for which we helped create over 100,000 new spaces.  \lineBreak We also gave them the choice that if parents wanted to stay at home and raise their own child, they could do that. If they wanted the child to stay with granny, they could do that. They are the experts on child care, and we support them. "
1713,"Mr. Speaker, our government believes that polygamy has no place in modern society. Polygamy inevitably leads to the exploitation of women, sometimes even young girls, who are given no other choice. This is unacceptable to Canadians and to our government. \lineBreak We have already raised the age of consent from 14 to 16 and currently have legislation before this House that would crack down on a wide variety of child sexual offences. \lineBreak Could the minister please update the House regarding the decision from the B.C. Supreme Court on this issue?","Mr. Speaker, needless to say that the B.C. Supreme Court has upheld the prohibition against polygamy. Polygamy has no place in modern society and the prohibition is consistent with Canadian values, the charter and the Canadian Bill of Rights. \lineBreak In our view, polygamy is harmful to society, to those involved with it, particularly to women and to children born within polygamous families. \lineBreak  Again, we are very pleased with the decision today."
1714,"Mr. Speaker, reports today say that the government is moving to allow more foreign ownership in our telecommunications industry. The Telecommunications Act states that one of its very purposes is to promote the ownership and control of Canadian carriers by Canadians. \lineBreak When is the government going to stop making foreign corporations its priority and instead put Canadian consumers first?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleagues that no decisions with regard to the upcoming spectrum auctions and foreign investment have been made yet. \lineBreak For the benefit of the member across the way, let me reiterate that in budget 2011 our government committed to an examination of foreign investment rules in the telecom sector. Our aim is to create better choices and lower costs for consumers. When we make decisions on how best to meet these targets, we will announce them directly and clearly."
1715,"Mr. Speaker, as usual, the government is saying that increased competition will lower prices, but international experience shows that the correlation between the number of competitors and price levels is very weak, especially in the telecommunications sector. \lineBreak Telecommunications are part of Canada's strategic infrastructure and this government is prepared to hand part of it over to foreign interests based on uncertain expectations in terms of pricing. \lineBreak Instead of threatening the domestic ownership of such crucial infrastructure, why does the government not directly help protect consumers from industry abuses, as Quebec did with cell phone contracts?","Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of the member opposite, I would like to reiterate that, in the 2011 budget, we committed to studying the rules surrounding foreign investment in the telecommunications sector. The goal is to offer consumers more choices and lower prices. When a decision is made, one that fulfills these objectives, we will make a direct, clear announcement. \lineBreak Allow me to say that, unlike the members opposite, we will not propose a tax hike of $10 billion. That would kill the economy. That would drastically increase costs and there would be no more jobs in Canada."
1716,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives cut off debate on the Canadian Wheat Board in the House twice and they tied the committee's hands behind its back. They tried and failed to pre-emptively cut off debate in the Senate. They ignored the farmer vote. They are deaf to farmers' voices. They have taken their clout away, and now $200 million of their hard-earned dollars and put our national food sovereignty in jeopardy.  \lineBreak Could the minister tell the House if he gave a second thought to how he is disfiguring western provinces and rural life with his ideological steamroller?","Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why we cut off debate when that is all we get. That is the quality of debate. \lineBreak We have three of the provinces affected by the Canadian Wheat Board area onside with us. They are looking forward to rural development. We have already seen announcements in small town western Canada that will add development and value-added to Wheat Board crops. \lineBreak We are on the right track. We are balanced and buoyed by the farmers in the Wheat Board area, and by the provinces affected as well."
1717,"Mr. Speaker, this week the Auditor General released a second report that gives our government strong marks for the delivery of Canada's economic action plan. During the global economic recession, Infrastructure Canada played a key role in stimulating our economy to create jobs for Canadians right across the country. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. We are proud of the fact that the Auditor General confirmed that Infrastructure Canada delivered the infrastructure stimulus program effectively. The employees of Infrastructure Canada and development agencies across the country did an enormous amount of work. Under very tight deadlines, they worked diligently and professionally to oversee the completion of thousands of projects across the country, and we owe them our thanks. Congratulations to the entire team."
1718,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Auditor General pointed out failures in Health Canada's drug review system that the government had pledged to fix back in 2007. Because of the government's failure to act, Canadians wait years to find out, if they find out at all, whether their drug is safe and effective. Because of government's failure, the health of every Canadian has been put at risk.  \lineBreak Why was this process not fixed five years ago? Why should Canadians believe that the minister will fix the process now when the government has known about it for so long?","Mr. Speaker, our government agrees with the Auditor General's recommendations and findings. \lineBreak Work is already under way to address the recommendations outlined. My department is making improvements on how Health Canada responds to reports concerning products that are on the market. \lineBreak  Again, the health and safety of Canadians is a priority for our government. We are putting the processes in place to ensure that the products on the market are safe, efficient and reliable for all Canadians."
1719,"Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, the chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee was forced to resign because of questionable financial transactions. We have learned that another committee member, the former Quebec health minister, Philippe Couillard, is also serving as an advisor to the Government of Saudi Arabia. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, our government takes the security of the information relating to Canadians' national security very seriously. \lineBreak Dr. Couillard practised for years as an internationally recognized neurosurgeon. He also happens to be a member of the International Advisory Board, Ministry of Health, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This involvement predates his appointment to SIRC, and was fully disclosed. \lineBreak We do not believe this to be any sort of conflict of interest."
1720,"Mr. Speaker, a growing number of Conservative MPs are questioning the government's position on asbestos. The government is making them betray their own conscience and support an industry that exports disease. The Asbestos mine recovery plan is not working and the mine in Thetford Mines has closed down its operations. Tomorrow morning, no one in Quebec will be paid for handling asbestos—absolutely no one. The minister's broken record is not creating any jobs. \lineBreak Will he finally realize that an economic diversification plan is urgently needed to create jobs for the people in his region?","Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, the Government of Canada has been supporting the safe use of chrysotile asbestos and recent scientific studies show that chrysotile fibre can be used safely in a controlled environment at the national or international level."
1721,"Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that certain changes were made to the evidence of the meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on November 2, 2011, including my testimony. Members of the NDP opposition have alleged that I made those changes. I did not, nor did anyone in my employ. These baseless and outrageous allegations form a serious breach of my privilege, which is impeding my work as a member of this House and as a minister of the Crown. \lineBreak Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you review this matter to determine how and why these changes were made and that you provide assurances to this House as to the reasons for any changes to the official record of this place. The suggestions from the opposition regarding any role by me are absolutely false, and I look forward to your attention to this matter. \lineBreak In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I believe you will find all the necessary information in my letter that I provided to you before question period. \lineBreak Thank you for your attention to this matter.", I will go to the member for

Canada is the only industrialized country that does not have a national affordable housing strategy. \lineBreak It has been 20 years since the House unanimously adopted a resolution to end child poverty and not a single measure has been taken. Only the NDP has made concrete proposals. What is the government waiting for to follow through?","Mr. Speaker, it is the NDP that has done nothing to help people who need affordable housing. For example, under our economic action plan, we provided funding to more than 14,000 projects to build and renovate affordable housing. The NDP members are the ones who voted against that measure. We also provided funding to help in the construction and renovation of affordable housing for aboriginals and seniors. The NDP voted against that measure. "
1725,"Mr. Speaker, it is not just the misguided crime bill that has the out-of-touch government in hot water; it turns out the government's proposed legislation to kill the long gun registry has legal problems of its own. \lineBreak Yesterday, the Information Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner confirmed that the destruction of registry data risks contravening not one, not two, but three Canadian laws. \lineBreak When will the government stop putting political motivation ahead of good public policy? Will it commit to preserving this data and respecting Canadian law?","Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member has not understood. We are changing the law. Claims that our legislation breaks the law simply do not make any sense in that context. \lineBreak  Our legislation will destroy the records which are increasingly inaccurate and unreliable, and become increasingly so over time. If given the chance, the opposition would once again use this data to target law-abiding citizens. We will not support the creation of the long gun registry through the back door."

Compared to other G20 countries, Canada ranks near the bottom in terms of clean energy investment. Instead of seizing the opportunity to be among the best, this government is simply twiddling its thumbs. \lineBreak Will the government get out of the sandbox and follow the example set by the rest of the world?","Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my hon. colleague on the good news of future prosperity driven by the development of the oil sands. I would remind her that Environment Canada administers and enforces any number of acts and regulations which impose requirements on the oil sands.

1734,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Muskoka minister made the claim, “the documentation that was in my purview was forwarded to the Auditor General, who had access to all documentation”. That is simply not true. \lineBreak Here is what the Auditor General said, “We received a small amount of documentation, which wasn't directly relevant”.  \lineBreak Therefore, why is it that, even as he is trying to protect his privileges, he cannot give the House a straight answer? When will he bring forward the documents that he has been hiding, just as he promised to our committee?","Mr. Speaker, the allegations from the hon. member are not true. I answered all the questions that were put to me at two committee meetings, 75 questions in all. I have co-operated fully with the Auditor General. The Auditor General, in her conclusions, made clear there needed to be more official documentation at the intake stage of projects. However, the Auditor General also made clear that all documentation for the approved project proved that all dollars were accounted for."

Now even Germany is having trouble selling its bonds. \lineBreak  Here in Canada, unemployment is going up, while job quality is going down. There are nearly 600,000 fewer full-time jobs in Canada today than just before the recession began in 2008. \lineBreak  Will the government stop making things worse and cancel its job-killing payroll tax increase that is planned for January 1? Just stop it.","Mr. Speaker, once again, there are 600,000 more people working in Canada than there were during the recession. We are one of the very few western countries to have achieved that outcome. \lineBreak We are obviously very concerned about the situation in Europe. That is why we have announced the employment insurance position that we have, which has been very well-received by the small business community in the country and which certainly opposes the Liberal idea of a 45-day work year that would add 65¢ to EI premiums."
1737,"Mr. Speaker, small business says, ""Freeze the premiums. Don't raise them by $600 million"".  \lineBreak Even with all of their economic trouble, the Americans do better than Canada on productivity growth. Therefore, facing this challenge, plus more global risk, more unemployment, a more vulnerable middle class, what does the government choose as its leading priority? Bigger jails. Its policy for affordable housing and mental health seems to be bigger jails. Its policy for aboriginal training and jobs is bigger jails.  \lineBreak Why is the government putting prisons ahead of schools? Think what that $13 billion could do for education and productivity.","Mr. Speaker, for this government, jails in our country are only for violent and repeat criminals. That is the policy of this government. \lineBreak Obviously for the population at large, this government is dedicated to the creation of jobs. That is why we were elected. That is the platform on which we ran. That is what we will do. \lineBreak I know the Liberal Party will vote against the creation of jobs, but that is why it will continue to sit in the far corner of the House of Commons."
1738,"Mr. Speaker, complacency is never good policy, especially when economic risks are rising and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is getting wider. Household debt is record high. Ten percent of Canadian kids live in poverty. Food banks are in growing demand. However, children in low-income families cannot qualify for the government's tax credits. Low-income firefighters cannot quality. Low-income home caregivers cannot qualify. \lineBreak Why are Conservative tax credits designed deliberately to exclude low income Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, this government recently passed a series of budget measures to help Canadian families, to provide tax credits for things like kids' education, to provide tax breaks to small business for new hiring. However, the Liberal Party of Canada, in its obstinate way, continued to oppose these measures, which are widely supported by Canadian families and Canadian business. \lineBreak  We are proud to be on the right side of these issues."

We were elected on a mandate to fight crime. That is exactly what we are doing."
1740,"Mr. Speaker, every day Canadians learn of more pork patronage from that out-of-touch government. Today, its defeated Conservative minister, Jean-Pierre Blackburn, could soon be jetting off to UNESCO in Paris thanks to his buddies.  \lineBreak Appointing Conservative friends to important posts undermines all appointments. Why is the government using the Alfonso Gagliano approach to rewarding failed ministers? When will the government clean up appointments and establish a public appointments commission like it promised?","Mr. Speaker, our government has committed very strongly to improving the quality of public appointments. We are very proud of the appointments we have made so far. \lineBreak In terms of the public appointments commission that has been referenced by the opposition member, we attempted to establish that. Last I checked, it was the opposition that blocked it from being put into place. "

I would also remind the House that the  \lineBreak Will the Conservatives stop giving their defeated candidates promotions, or will they simply continue this culture of entitlement and giving gifts to their friends?","Mr. Speaker, I welcome the NDP's support for an elected Senate. It is a good idea, and I encourage the NDP to support our bill, which, once law, will allow for such appointments."
1742,"Mr. Speaker, after several damning reports pointing out their mismanagement on important files like military procurement, the Conservatives are now proposing to cut the Office of the Auditor General. Our new AG's first task is to cut 60 jobs. \lineBreak That is quite a coincidence, just days after the AG's fall report described some government spending as “disturbing”. What does the Conservative government have against being audited?","Mr. Speaker, as President of the Treasury Board not only did I take it upon myself to be part of the process that is reviewing 67 government departments and agencies, but I also wrote to various other officials and agencies that could also, on a voluntary basis, contribute to making sure that the government spends within its means. That includes the Speaker of the House and the Auditor General. I think that is fair. I think it is fair that we all work together. \lineBreak When is the NDP going to join us in coming up with solid, decent proposals to help make sure the government spends within its means?"
1743,"Mr. Speaker, auditors find problems with the government, and that is where it could actually save the money to make sure those 60 jobs stay intact and that the savings are passed on to Canadians. \lineBreak To quote the Auditor General, some government projects were “so poorly monitored that some producers made business arrangements that undermined the program”. \lineBreak With these types of conclusions on recent Conservative mismanagement of government programs, why is the government cutting the budget of the major accountability watchdog agency? What is it trying to hide?","Mr. Speaker, nothing could be farther from the truth. \lineBreak We feel it is important to continue on with a low-tax agenda that creates jobs and opportunity in our economy and to make sure that the government and all of its relevant agencies spend within their means. \lineBreak The NDP wants to raise taxes. The NDP does not care about jobs for citizens; we do, and we are going to continue, because we have the mandate from the people to do so."
1744,"Mr. Speaker, if the government wants to convince us that it has nothing to hide, it will have to give us better answers than that. \lineBreak We learned recently that nearly 20 annual audits of small boards, agencies and tribunals will be withdrawn from the Auditor General's program. The Auditor General conducts very important, independent audits, like the one that found inappropriate behaviour on the part of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. \lineBreak Will those budgets also be cut? What is this government trying to achieve with that? Perhaps it is because the government would prefer that no one be able to check its books.","Mr. Speaker, Canada is not immune to the problems that other countries are facing. Canadians gave us a strong mandate to protect and complete Canada's economic recovery. \lineBreak We are carrying out that agenda, the agenda of the people. It includes lower taxes. It includes focusing on jobs and opportunity. It includes government spending within its means."
1745,"Mr. Speaker, I have a simple question on ozone monitoring based entirely on what the  \lineBreak In the House he said that his cuts are simply consolidating and streamlining duplicating measurements, but in his own signed order paper answer, hopefully not an unreliable source, he states that: “These measurements complement, but do not duplicate each other”. \lineBreak Can the minister please clarify for us whether the two measurements that his department uses, ozonesondes and Brewer, are complementary or duplicated?","Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that my hon. colleague spend less time trying to mine past statements to prove some dire hypothetical outcome. The simple message that my colleague should hear, digest and accept is that Environment Canada will continue to monitor ozone."
1746,"Mr. Speaker, as health ministers meet this week, Canadians are looking for leadership from the federal government, not only on the upcoming 2014 health accord but also on the lack of action from the 2004 accord. It is clear that the government has dropped the ball on health care. Right now, five million Canadians do not have a family doctor. \lineBreak I ask the ","Mr. Speaker, of course I do not accept the premise of that question. The minister will have the opportunity to meet with health ministers tomorrow to discuss what we have learned from the 2004 health accord. Our government is committed to a universal and publicly funded health care system and the Canada Health Act. We are committed to continuing the 6% escalator to the provinces and territories.  \lineBreak The upcoming discussions will be about accountability and results for Canadians, because that is what they want, which will include better reporting from the provinces and territories to measure that progress."
1747,"Mr. Speaker, Canadian families are still waiting for an affordable drug plan and long-term care and want to know why there has been no federal action on the commitments made in 2004. With an aging population, lowering the cost of prescription drugs is more important than ever. The government has had five years to act, but nothing has been done. \lineBreak How can we expect leadership from the government on the 2014 health accord if it still has not delivered on the promises that were made in 2004?","Mr. Speaker, again, our government is committed to the Canada Health Act, and we have committed to continue supporting the provinces and territories. We have delivered over 30% more money to the provinces and territories to deliver the services to Canadians, which is provincial jurisdiction, and we are having great conversations with the provinces and territories. These conversations have started two and a half years before the end of the health accord so that we can get started on the next agreements with the provinces, and we are looking forward to that."
1748,"Mr. Speaker, ever since the Conservatives have been in power, they have been turning a blind eye to the pressing needs in the health care system. \lineBreak Still today, 5 million Canadians do not have a family doctor. Wait times in emergency rooms are getting longer. \lineBreak With the negotiations on the 2014 health accord starting this week, the Conservatives have an opportunity to work with the provinces and territories to correct this embarrassing situation. This is a critical accord. \lineBreak What will this government do to guarantee Canadians real, measurable results to improve our public health care system?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, we have been working with the provinces and territories and following through with the accord that was signed in 2004. We are taking a proactive approach with the provinces and territories. It is two and a half years before the end of this agreement.  \lineBreak We have continued to support the provinces and territories with the delivery of their health care. We respect their jurisdiction and we are looking forward to their ideas and what they are finding on the front lines so that we can work together, because that is what Canadians want. They want governments to work together for the best health care system in the world for Canadians."
1749,"Mr. Speaker, this government has not been able to keep its promises on the current health accord. That is not very proactive. \lineBreak The government promised to be accountable to Canadians on the $40 billion investments in this accord, but eight years later, the situation is far from improved. \lineBreak Far too many Canadians still have to wait for surgery, others do not have access to home care, and drug insurance coverage is inadequate, to name a few of the problems. \lineBreak In the negotiations to renew the health accord, will the government show leadership to ensure that Canadians can have the health care they deserve?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the NDP has been in regard to health care for Canadians.  \lineBreak Our government has increased health care transfers to the provinces and territories by over 30% since forming government. If the NDP members were paying attention, they would know we made additional investments in pandemic preparedness, medical and neurological research, food and product safety, wait times, electronic health records and aboriginal health care. Each and every one of these things the NDP voted against. \lineBreak  When are they going to get onside with Canadians so that we can work together to have the best health care system available to communities? "
1750,"Mr. Speaker, recently, the media have reported some problematic situations regarding the language of work in several companies in Quebec. \lineBreak Could the minister responsible for Quebec tell us whether the government intends to take action on this issue, which is so important to Quebeckers?","Mr. Speaker, the NDP has clearly not done its homework with regard to language of work. \lineBreak Our government is committed to promoting and protecting the French language in Canada. I have the privilege of announcing today in the House that our government is going to set up a consultative committee that will be responsible for determining whether a problem exists with regard to the French language in federally regulated private businesses. \lineBreak French is an integral part of our history, our identity and our daily lives. French is Canada's founding language, and our Conservative government is very proud of that."
1751,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives can call us anything they want. If they put as much effort into creating a serious plan for sustainable development of the oil sands, the United States and Europe would not be slamming the door on Canada. While they refuse to act to protect our environment, our jobs are going up in smoke. \lineBreak Will the minister finally listen to what Canadians want and come up with a sustainable plan for our resources?","Mr. Speaker, in a torturous scrum yesterday, the NDP environment critic twisted herself into a pretzel of contradiction and bizarre ideas. She admits it is all about jobs, but she opposes Keystone XL, which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in Canada. She wants refineries built, but does not want pipelines built to send the refined oil to product. Can members believe it? \lineBreak I ask the member, is this total confusion or rank cynicism? Canadians--"
1752,"Order, please. The hon. member for Halifax.","Mr. Speaker, if being a grumpy old man makes one an expert on world--"
1753,"Order, please. We are not even through our second week of a five-week stretch. If we cannot get through this week, I hate to think what next week will be like. Let us have a little bit of order.  \lineBreak The hon. member for Halifax, and I hope she will not make personal comments about other colleagues.","Mr. Speaker, this is the smiling face of cynicism. \lineBreak This week I met with European representatives, who told me that because of the government's inaction on climate change, Europe is slamming the door on Canadian energy, which is the same reason that the Americans slammed the door on Keystone. With every door that closes, the minister is killing Canadian jobs.  \lineBreak When will the government clean up its act and actually support real job growth in the Canadian energy sector?"
1754,"Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to go to foreign countries and work against the interests of Canadian workers and those who are unemployed from coast to coast. It is another thing to insult senior citizens.  \lineBreak In this country we live was on the shoulders of our ancestors. How despicable--","Order, please. The hon. member for Burnaby—New Westminster has the floor. We will have a little bit of order."
1755,"Mr. Speaker, on another matter, why does the  \lineBreak In committee, we asked the minister if he would table all the documents sent to his office. In committee, he said yes. He said “sure” twice. Not once, but twice. Not only has he not tabled the documents, but the minutes were changed and he has the gall to ask for an investigation into the matter. \lineBreak Does the Prime Minister realize that this farce has gone on long enough?","Mr. Speaker, the "
1756,"Mr. Speaker, we take no lessons from that minister or this failed government on jobs.  \lineBreak Last month the Conservatives lost 72,000 full-time jobs across the country. Seventy-two thousand families lost their breadwinner because of the government's policies. Statistics Canada announced today that real wages for Canadians went down nearly 2% over the past year under this government. \lineBreak People say that Tory times are tough times, but when will they start to care about middle-class and poor Canadians? When will they get down to work on helping struggling Canadian families? Where is the jobs plan that we have been asking for in this House week after week?","Mr. Speaker, it is the one the NDP voted against on Monday night in the House of Commons. Do they remember that? They refused to support the budget.  \lineBreak They voted against the job creation tax credit for more than half a million small businesses in Canada. That is the part of the economy that generates jobs, the 600,000 net new jobs we have in Canada since the end of the recession. \lineBreak They voted against the family caregiver tax credit, the children's art tax credit, the volunteer firefighters tax credit, tax relief for the manufacturing sector and making the gas tax fund permanent for infrastructure for municipalities. \lineBreak That is where the jobs come from. Why does the member keep voting against everything?"
1757,"Mr. Speaker, I have seen it all. The minister does not know that the government lost 62,000 full-time jobs last month. That is unbelievable. Today we learn that Canadian workers are earning 2% less this year than last year because of the Conservatives' policies. It is very clear that this government could not care less about ordinary families. \lineBreak When will the Conservatives come up with a plan? When will they take care of real people? When will they do their job, produce and create—",The hon. 
1758,"Mr. Speaker, the NDP bandies about numbers with respect to jobs, so I thought I would seek some authority about their numbers. I went to one of the large unions and the Canadian Labour of Congress's chief economist, Andrew Jackson, said that the Conservatives have the job numbers about right.

1759,"Mr. Speaker, the people of Neuville are worried about an airport being built in their area, but the  \lineBreak He should probably tell his staffer, who told the mayor of Neuville last week that he would organize a meeting. Perhaps the issue is that no one knows what falls under the minister's jurisdiction. \lineBreak Will the minister finally commit to meeting with mayors who are worried about the effects of the Carriage by Air Act?","Mr. Speaker, our government has a tremendous amount of respect for provincial and municipal jurisdictions in Quebec. This member does not understand that the city is responsible for what happens within a municipal region. The mayor and the city council have an agreement. The city signed an agreement with the developer to minimize the effects of the construction. \lineBreak Could we talk about federal jurisdiction in the House and allow those in other jurisdictions to do their jobs?"
1760,"Mr. Speaker, it took a veteran's desperate act to make the minister agree to establish a consultative committee on veterans' health. \lineBreak The minister promised Pascal Lacoste that the committee would be set up by December 8. That is in two weeks' time. However, we have heard absolutely nothing since he made the announcement. All we know is that the first topic of study will be the effects of exposure to depleted uranium.  \lineBreak Can the minister tell us who will sit on the committee in question and can he commit to tabling the committee's report in the House?","Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, when it is time to vote for our veterans, we rise and support the budget initiatives to help them. Furthermore, when it is time to help veterans, as I helped Mr. Lacoste, we extend our hand to them. We are prepared to provide him with treatment and an assessment that meet his needs and those of his brothers in arms. I made the commitment and hon. members will have to stay tuned: the veterans' health committee will be set up by December 8."
1761,"Mr. Speaker, first nations members have been calling for the same accountability and transparency from their elected officials that all Canadians expect and deserve. \lineBreak Despite fierce opposition from the NDP and the Liberals, our government is taking action to ensure that first nations people can access financial information about their chiefs and councillors, and take real steps toward democratic and economic change. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, our government believes that first nations, like all Canadians, deserve transparency and accountability from their elected officials. \lineBreak The first nations transparency and accountability act builds on our government's ongoing commitment to ensuring first nations have strong, transparent and accountable governments. It will also decrease the reporting burden. \lineBreak We have listened to community members who have repeatedly said this is necessary for their communities. I am proud that our government is taking action, which has been long overdue."
1762,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak What is the minister going to do to prevent Quebec from being divided in two, with half going to Trenton and the other half going to Halifax, and to ensure that this rescue centre, located across from his riding, can continue to save lives on the St. Lawrence River and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence? ","Mr. Speaker, in terms of the sub-centre in Quebec City, the member can rest assured that the services provided in Trenton will have fully bilingual people trained to perform that duty. There will be no jeopardy on safety and security."
1763,"Mr. Speaker, under the ecological gift program, businessman Alfonso Argento donated Île Lapierre and walked away with nearly $14 million. The island is covered in garbage and no longer has any ecological value. All the officials who worked on the file have said so. The land was last evaluated at less than $400,000.  \lineBreak How could the Government of Canada have determined a market value of $14 million, when no assessment agrees with that amount?","Mr. Speaker, of course, when it comes to assessing land values, there are jurisdictions here, too. Our government has always operated based on respect for the environmental value of all federal assets. We will focus on the things under federal jurisdiction."
1764,"Mr. Speaker, the media has recently been reporting on clashes near Tahrir Square. Canadians are rightly concerned about the difficult transition from the Mubarak regime to a democratically elected and legitimate government of Egypt.  \lineBreak As the House knows, Canada has played a significant role in assisting the Arab Spring, as well as supporting democratic aspirations of the people of northern Africa and the Middle East. \lineBreak  In this regard, I would ask the ","Mr. Speaker, I think I can speak for all members of the House that we are outraged when we see the violence in Tahrir Square when people are seeking to peacefully protest. We are outraged when we see Coptic Christians in Egypt being targeted and many being killed.  \lineBreak We are calling on all sides to work co-operatively toward the elections that are coming up this Monday and to ensure that democracy will outweigh the violence that we have seen in recent days."
1765,"Mr. Speaker, my question is a matter of federal jurisdiction. What the member for  \lineBreak Is the minister going to take the same stand with regard to the people in his riding who worked at the Irving sawmill, which closed in October, and tell those who do not have a grade 12 education that they are not entitled to benefits? Come on. Why does the minister want to penalize workers in the Atlantic provinces?","Mr. Speaker, we want to help people find jobs. That is why we gave the provinces and territories funding for training and education through our economic action plan—so that unemployed workers can acquire the skills they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow. That is the best way to help these people. It is unfortunate that the NDP does not believe it. "
1766,"Mr. Speaker, I have noticed a disturbing trend developing around the Thursday question over the past several weeks. It is a trend that allows the government House leader to take advantage of a certain convention. \lineBreak The hon. member on the government side is using the Thursday statement to create spin and rhetoric concerning the government's legislative agenda. \lineBreak Last week, even after my colleague from  \lineBreak That is what he is supposed to be doing. In fact, he argued in favour of a number of bills, including Bills  \lineBreak If you review the record, Mr. Speaker, there can be no doubt that it was debate, not simply providing information, as the Thursday question is supposed be for. \lineBreak Also, Mr. Speaker, you will know as well as anyone else that this past week, the government voted to shut down healthy debate for the 10th time in this Parliament. It continues to undermine Canadian democratic principles by ramming bills through the House without adequate debate. This, too, is a radical and much more serious departure from the traditions of this place, which enshrine the duty of MPs to exam and debate legislation comprehensively before passing judgment on it. \lineBreak I would ask the government House leader what the business of the House will be for the next week. I would also ask, if he is allowed to stray from his talking points, if he perhaps could spare us the spin from the Conservative war room and curtail his own debate rather than that of MPs trying to do their jobs on behalf of all Canadians.","Mr. Speaker, this is delivering results on jobs week. \lineBreak I will begin by noting that the highlight of the week was the passage of the budget implementation act, Bill  \lineBreak We have also advanced Bill  \lineBreak Of course, Tuesday afternoon and again this morning, the House has continued debate on the opposition amendment to decline second reading of Bill  \lineBreak Tomorrow will be the sixth allotted day. \lineBreak On Monday, we will start here for law-abiding Canadians week. \lineBreak On Tuesday, we will start the post-committee stages of Bill  \lineBreak On Thursday, we will continue here for law-abiding Canadians week with the start of debate on second reading of Bill  \lineBreak Finally, as part of this week’s delivering results on jobs week, on behalf of my honourable friend, the  \lineBreak Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I ask that an order of the day be designated for the consideration of this motion. For the benefit of the House, I plan to call this motion immediately after question period on Tuesday of next week."
1767,"Mr. Speaker, this is a separate point of order, but ties in a bit with what has been happening in the last little while. \lineBreak We are concerned about decorum in the House. The applause yesterday for the demonstrator is an encouragement for decorum to continue to decline. The NDP made a pledge for proper decorum in the House, but I was very disturbed today by the fact that the NDP applauded the statement made by the member for  \lineBreak At first one could view this as just the view of the one member for  \lineBreak I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, what could be done to remedy this situation?  \lineBreak The comment is an insult to seniors across this country. The member did not retract her statement. She had lots of time to do that. I would like you to review that, and if you agree with me that this is demeaning to Parliament, I would like to pursue this further.","Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member in defence of seniors. That being said, the comments that the minister is making about the hon. member for  \lineBreak We will take no lessons from a government that treats the opposition in such a cavalier manner, denies it the basic right to debate most of the bills introduced in the House and is acting almost like a dictatorship. \lineBreak This results in a type of behaviour that is somewhat unfortunate. Indeed, we would like there to be decorum, but decorum and respect have to be earned."
1768,"Mr. Speaker, I will keep my remarks short. What is disturbing is using legitimate points of order as an attempt to create a narrative that then can go out to the public. That undermines the role of a point of order. \lineBreak The idea that members of the New Democratic Party are to sit and be polite to whatever government insults they receive on a daily basis—",I have just been informed that the earpieces are not working.  \lineBreak They are working now. The hon. member for Timmins—James Bay.
1769,"Mr. Speaker, the hon. colleague is concerned that the term that the member was acting like a “grumpy old man” was somehow to be inferred as a complete insult to senior citizens across this country. People back home would think this is like the bully who suddenly gets challenged. \lineBreak If we are going to talk about legitimate points of order, we should be following basic parliamentary procedures, not “he called me that” or “she called me this”, especially when we see the kind of ridicule that comes off the government benches on a daily basis.  \lineBreak I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to be mindful of the larger role of parliamentary democracy and not be taken in by these attempts to rewrite the public record as being malicious attempts to undermine everything that is good in this country just because we are doing our job of challenging ministers who are refusing to answer questions.","I appreciate that some members may want to add, but we have gone on now for over half an hour on these points. The Chair has heard enough on all three issues raised today, and we will move on to orders of the day. \lineBreak The hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh is rising on a different point of order."
1770,"Mr. Speaker, next week the United Nations negotiations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change will begin in Durban. Given that the ","Mr. Speaker, we have no such plans right now."
1771,"Mr. Speaker, it is with some sadness that I stand today to make this point, but you may be able to allow me some indulgence. \lineBreak Concerning the five incidents that the opposition House leader just referred to, it is passing coincidence that in each of those five cases the individual was sponsored by a member of Parliament from the New Democratic Party. \lineBreak As we just discussed, emotions were running high yesterday in the House. In addition, the hon. member for  \lineBreak For the record, I would like to remind the members of the House that I support the government's decision. We wanted bilingual candidates. Upon completion of a rigorous process, it was determined that the candidate chosen was by far the most competent applicant. I am happy to know that Mr. Ferguson has committed to becoming bilingual and that he has already been taking language courses for several weeks. \lineBreak The hon. member knows full well that I am careful not to play partisan games. She also knows that I welcomed her here with all the dignity she deserves. She could have a promising future in the House, serving the riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, her province and her country. For that to happen, she should avoid picking up bad habits and stick to what was said, instead of putting words into the mouths of other members. \lineBreak I would be pleased to provide you with a transcript of the speech I gave the day before yesterday before the Standing Committee on Official Languages. \lineBreak In fact, I would be prepared to table it at this time if the House would give me unanimous consent.",Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to table the document to which he is referring? \lineBreak The Chair will take the matter under advisement and come back to the House if necessary. \lineBreak The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville is rising on a different point.
1772,"Mr. Speaker, Justice Nunn is not the only one the government is ignoring. Victims of gun crime are here today in Ottawa desperate to be heard. \lineBreak The Steyr HS .50 sniper rifle can pierce an armoured target from a kilometre and a half away. The Ruger Mini-14 has killed before. However, we are losing our last remaining safeguard in this legislation. Anyone will soon be able to sell these rifles and dangerous shotguns on the street without even checking for a valid gun licence. \lineBreak In 2006 the government included safeguards for rifles being bought and sold. This time there is no such luck. What has changed?","Mr. Speaker, we understand the NDP is opposed to the abolition of the long gun registry, which targets ordinary law-abiding citizens. In fact, the member is incorrect. It is against the law to sell firearms to an unlicensed individual. There is a penalty of up to five years for that. \lineBreak The member knows that and yet he makes that kind of a statement."
1773,"Mr. Speaker, a dangerous loophole in the bill to abolish the firearms registry could enable people without valid permits to purchase firearms such as semi-automatic rifles. Gun vendors will no longer be required to verify whether buyers have a permit. \lineBreak Today, the Groupe des étudiants et diplômés de Polytechnique pour le contrôle des armes, the Fédération des femmes du Québec and the Association québécoise de prévention du suicide came to Ottawa to express their outrage. The government is leaving the door wide open for criminals and is abandoning victims. That is shameful. \lineBreak Will the government wake up before it is too late?","Mr. Speaker, selling a firearm to someone without a licence is a crime. If people do so, they will be held accountable to the full extent of the law. Again, the member knows we are doing nothing in that respect by abolishing the long gun registry. \lineBreak  Rather than misleading people, I would ask her to get on board and work with us to target real criminals. That actually helps victims from becoming victims again."
1774,"I recommend the minister read his own law.  \lineBreak This government, in the name of standing up for victims, is forcing a misguided crime bill on us that is based on personal observations instead of scientific studies. So much for being tough on crime. \lineBreak The only study they have is from Justice Nunn, an expert on youth justice. This study does not have to do with every aspect of Bill  \lineBreak Could the government give us just one scientific study in support of this bill?","Mr. Speaker, we have had input right across the country. I was very pleased, for instance, to get the input of the NDP in Manitoba, which has encouraged us to move forward on these initiatives. I can see that does not impress the hon. member.  \lineBreak The bill is very targeted. It goes after drug traffickers and those who would molest children. It sends out the right message.  \lineBreak The hon. member talks about victims. I am proud to be a part of the only party that stands up for victims and law-abiding Canadians in our country."
1775,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are very disturbed by the government's refusal to stand up to the U.S. and protect Canadian interests. Thousand of Stelco employees have been out of work for over three years because the Conservatives failed to set out clear takeover criteria under the Investment Canada Act.  \lineBreak The government promised over a year ago to define the net benefit test. Why has the minister failed to live up to that promise? Why has he failed to defend Canadian jobs?","Mr. Speaker, the government defends Canadian jobs each and every day. We referred this important issue to the industry committee so that it could take the time to study the issue and report back to government. What happened? What stopped the industry committee? It was the Liberal Party of Canada that voted to call an early opportunistic election, rather than allowing the industry committee to do its important work.  \lineBreak  If we had not had an early election, the industry committee would have finished its good work."
1776,"Mr. Speaker, the fact that the Conservative government has not been defending Canadian interests is very disturbing. \lineBreak The Conservatives buried their heads in the sand when the United States was moving ahead with its Buy American policy and so many other irritants. Now they are on the verge of signing a perimeter security agreement with the Americans. \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite had his way, he would not sign any agreement until every challenge had been dealt with.  \lineBreak We have a good working relationship with the Obama administration under the  \lineBreak Sometimes in the manufacturing sector parts will go back and forth as many as 7 to 12 times. These border problems have a huge impact on the Canadian economy, and the Prime Minister has been working incredibly hard to tear down these barriers to protect and promote Canadian economic growth. No final deal has been reached but, under the Prime Minister's leadership, I am confident it will. "
1777,"Mr. Speaker, the Attawapiskat First Nation declared a state of emergency four weeks ago. Families are living in tents, in shacks and in trailers. People are in danger because of cold temperatures, yet no federal official has bothered going to see the community. \lineBreak Yesterday, the government promised $2 million in assistance. Can the government confirm this and does it have a long-term plan to improve the situation in Attawapiskat?","Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned about the situation. The community is facing a number of challenges. We have had ongoing discussions with the chief and council in order to make progress on addressing these issues. My officials will be in the community early next week to discuss the next steps. "
1778,"Mr. Speaker, Attawapiskat is a community that has tried to do things right and yet it has continued to fall behind from chronic underfunding and systemic negligence in terms of infrastructure, education, housing and health. The situation is causing an international outcry and Canadians are rightly wondering how this can happen in a country as rich as Canada. \lineBreak Will the government commit to take the lead with eight officials and with the community to fix the situation in Attawapiskat so that we can return to the community to the kind of dignity that these people deserve?","Mr. Speaker, we are taking this situation seriously. The community has a number of challenges, one of them being its financial challenge. It is in co-management. It has an indebtedness that is getting in the way of a lot of other progress that could be made. \lineBreak Part of our overall next steps is to get to a place where proper local administration and governance can ensure there is progress being made in the community."
1779,"Mr. Speaker, it took hearing the testimony of representatives of the Norwegian government yesterday at the Standing Committee on National Defence for people to realize that the  \lineBreak Since the Conservatives' numbers are simply wrong, should we be asking the Norwegian government to do our math for us?","Mr. Speaker, that is as onerous a statement as I have ever heard. Comparing our situation with Norway's situation is a quick fix that goes nowhere. \lineBreak This morning, I met with a secretary from Norway. We discussed the issue broadly. Canada's program is on track, and our figures reconcile. The member needs to do her homework."
1780,"Mr. Speaker, this week, the Auditor General indicated that the government does not even have enough money to ensure basic maintenance of our aircraft. According to the Norwegian government's realistic cost calculations, an estimated $40 billion will be required over 30 years to maintain 52 F-35s. It seems that this government is trying to fob off its miscalculations to future generations. \lineBreak Will this government stop misleading Canadians and show us the real numbers?","Mr. Speaker, the excitement is overwhelming indeed. \lineBreak I will just quote the minister from Norway, who stated categorically, among other things, “I want to say that my government is strongly committed to the F-35s”. He has also encouraged us. We will stay with that program. \lineBreak Our budget for the purchase of F-35s remains on track and the figures are calculated accurately. The member opposite needs to do her own math to get to the bottom of what she is alleging, which is not true."
1781,"Mr. Speaker, the associate minister is making facts up as he goes along. \lineBreak Yesterday he claimed that his F-35s would be able to communicate with our ground troops as soon as we get them, but his own department says that is simply not true, putting our troops at risk of friendly fire. \lineBreak The associate minister is in way over his head. Will he finally put this contract out to tender so our troops are not stuck with planes that put them in danger?","Mr. Speaker, the only danger here is the rhetoric coming from the opposite side. \lineBreak Contrary to the member's misrepresentation, the facts are that Canada is scheduled to receive its delivery of F-35 aircraft, equipped with the ability to locate and communicate with other aircraft and know where friendly ground units are well in advance of deployment on operation. \lineBreak Our plan is on track. Things are working. The aircraft are coming off the production line. They are being flown and delivered to partner countries as we speak."
1782,"Mr. Speaker, there is a mountain of evidence from multiple reliable sources that contradicts what the associate minister tells the House every day. The associate minister is at odds with his own minister, his own ministry and now with our allies. \lineBreak Yesterday, the Norwegians told us that they expect to pay five times what the Conservative government will pay for the F-35s, $40 billion for 13 fewer planes, and they acknowledge that it may go up. \lineBreak How did Canada qualify for an 80% discount, or is the minister just making these numbers up?","Mr. Speaker, all reasonable people agree that we need the aircraft to defend Canadian sovereignty. Our plan is on track, and we will provide the air force with the equipment it needs to defend that sovereignty. \lineBreak If the opposition had its way, it would cancel the equipment that our air force agrees is the best for it to do its job safely and effectively, never mind the reference to our men and women. \lineBreak This government is the one that has been rebuilding the equipment and providing the resources that our air force and military people need and we will keep on doing it. "
1783,"Mr. Speaker, this government announced very quietly the establishment of an advisory committee to determine whether it is possible to work in French in federally regulated businesses in Quebec. We do not know who will sit on this committee, which businesses will be targeted, what timeframe will be set and, more importantly, whether the committee's report will be released. The New Democratic Party did its homework and has already drafted a bill on this issue.  \lineBreak Why waste time, instead of simply supporting our initiative?","Mr. Speaker, when it comes to French, we will not take lessons from the NDP. It is important to promote French and also English. We are a bilingual country and I am proud to be a Canadian.  \lineBreak As regards the legislation, our government always passes laws that are based on facts. We will see what is going on in Quebec before supporting any bill."
1784,"Mr. Speaker, that is nice rhetoric. The government is really dragging its feet, improvising and trying to create a distraction. If setting up a committee were such a good idea, the government would have done it during the previous session, when the hon. member for  \lineBreak This government is constantly showing a lack of respect for francophones in Quebec and across Canada. We know that some federally regulated private companies in Quebec, such as National Bank and Air Canada to name only two, do not care about French in the workplace.  \lineBreak The NDP is proposing concrete measures. Will the government stop trying to save face and work with us to settle this issue?","Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the committee will look at the facts and then report to Canadians. The most important thing for us is that we live in a bilingual country and we must promote the two official languages of that country. This is what we are going to do. "
1785,"Mr. Speaker, this nice rhetoric is fine, but there is no need to redo the job 10 times. The issue of French in federally regulated private businesses was reviewed in depth a long time ago. This is evidenced by the fact that, today, the NDP is introducing a bill on this issue and it will be debated this afternoon.  \lineBreak Will the government support us in our efforts to quickly pass this legislation? Does it prefer to waste time and taxpayers' money by setting up another committee?","Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed to hear the opposition member talk about wasting time. Taking a close look at an issue before making a decision is not wasting parliamentarians' time."
1786,"Mr. Speaker, last year when Canadians heard that CIDA would be streamlining the application process for developing programs, they expected improvement. \lineBreak It turns out that for Conservatives, streamlining just means delaying. Fifty groups have waited for over three months to hear whether they are getting the funding. Critical programs in developing countries are being cut. \lineBreak Why is the minister putting these important development projects at risk?","Mr. Speaker, the government is committed to assistance that is effective, focused and accountable. \lineBreak We ensure each project is an effective use of taxpayers' dollars. The amount of time to review proposals varies, depending on the overall number of applications and the size, complexity and risks associated with each proposal. \lineBreak The proposals are under consideration. I cannot comment further until the due diligence and evaluation process is completed."
1787,"Mr. Speaker, these people are trying to help the world's poorest, and all they get from the government is doublespeak and off-base attacks. \lineBreak CIDA was four months past its own deadline, waiting for a media event, to announce the Muskoka initiative funding. The International Aboriginal Youth Internships were timed so the minister could announce them on a particular day. \lineBreak Why is the minister more interested in flashy press conferences than actually getting the job done?","Mr. Speaker, no organization is entitled to receive taxpayers' dollars indefinitely. \lineBreak Our responsibility is to Canadian taxpayers. It requires us to ensure that the official development assistance is more effective, more focused and more accountable. \lineBreak The proposals are under consideration, and I will not speculate on when the due diligence and evaluation process will be completed."
1788,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak However, the minister did confirm that Conservatives are throwing away $20 million on private sector slashing experts and threatening to shut down entire programs.  \lineBreak My questions is the following: which programs and services that Canadian families rely on are on the chopping block of their private consultants?","Mr. Speaker, Canada is not immune to the problems facing other countries. Reckless spending and out of control debt are key causes of problems in other countries today.  \lineBreak Canadians gave us a strong mandate to protect and complete Canada's economic recovery. Our government has a plan to keep taxes low, focus on jobs for Canadians, and growing the economy."
1789,"Mr. Speaker, this government should put its rhetoric aside and think about the families who need government services. Departments are announcing huge cuts without telling us where they will be made. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Infrastructure Canada, Industry Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada have all announced cuts, but they are not saying where the millions will be cut. \lineBreak Before wasting $20 million on private contracts, will the government ensure that it understands what is going on in its own departments?","Mr. Speaker, under our government, Canada has created nearly 600,000 new jobs. Canadians gave us a strong mandate to protect and complete Canada's economic recovery. While the opposition is calling for higher taxes that would kill jobs and hurt the economy, our government has a plan to keep taxes low, focus on jobs for Canadians, and growing the economy. \lineBreak  Reckless spending and out of control debt are the key problems facing other countries today and we do not intend to follow that path."
1790,"Mr. Speaker, today the Supreme Court prevented Saputo and Kraft Canada from challenging the cheese compositional standards that our government brought in a few years ago. This will ensure that processors continue to use real Canadian milk in the production of Canadian cheese.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, in 2008 our government introduced a cheese compositional standard to ensure that real Canadian milk was used in the production of Canadian cheese. This decision by the Supreme Court is beneficial to both consumers and Canadian dairy farmers because it ensures that our world-class cheese continues to be made with world-class milk.  \lineBreak This is yet another example of how our government stands up both for consumers and our supply managed farmers. It demonstrates clearly that we put farmers first."
1791,"Mr. Speaker, the jig is up for the asbestos industry. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars subsidizing this industry and trying to block international efforts to curb its use, the last remaining asbestos mine is finally on the ropes.  \lineBreak Instead of shovelling even more corporate welfare into this deadly and dying industry, why do the Conservatives not use that money for economic development in the region to help those people transition out of this deadly and dying industry into an industry with a future?","Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, the Government of Canada has been promoting the safe, controlled use of chrysotile both here and abroad. All of the scientific studies have shown that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment."
1792,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' broken record will not create any jobs tomorrow morning. By passively watching the industry slowly die —just as people are dying of respiratory illnesses in India and other developing countries—the government has turned its back on asbestos workers and an entire region's economy. Asbestos production has stopped and workers are finding themselves without jobs and without a transition program. \lineBreak Is this government so pro-cancer that it cannot recognize that it is making the wrong choices by trying to make people believe that there is still a future for this industry?","Mr. Speaker, all the scientific studies have shown that chrysotile can be used safely in a controlled environment. We on this side of the House have nothing to learn from the party on the other side, whose members do not even know what is going on in Quebec's economic regions."
1793,"Mr. Speaker, the government is failing Canadian seniors. It consistently refuses to put in place measures that would allow our seniors to age with dignity. On pensions, it offers retirement roulette. On GIS, the government offers little. On affordable housing and health care, the government offers absolutely nothing. \lineBreak Why does the government refuse to defend the dignity of Canadian seniors?","Mr. Speaker, the opposite is what is true. In fact, it is our government that increased the earnings exemption for the GIS from $500 to $3,500. It was our government that brought in pension income splitting to help seniors lower their taxes so they would have more money to spend. It was our government that invested $400 million in affordable housing under the economic action plan just for seniors. \lineBreak The list goes on and on, but we only have a short period of time. I suggest, though, that the NDP, instead of railing against it, should actually have supported some of these measures."
1794,"Mr. Speaker, I want to have a dialogue on the current needs of seniors, but this government is changing the subject to avoid answering the question, which is worrisome. I guess the minister does not realize that not every senior is going to have a pension as cushy as his. \lineBreak FADOQ, the largest seniors' organization in Quebec, personally told me that many seniors simply do not have access to the services they need. FADOQ is disappointed by this government's false promises, as are we. \lineBreak How can seniors trust this government if the only thing it can offer is feigned indignation and empty promises?","Mr. Speaker, we have done a lot for our seniors, those who built this great and wonderful country. Unfortunately, the New Democratic Party has opposed every one of our efforts to help seniors. For example, yesterday, an NDP MP insulted every senior in Canada. That is unacceptable."
1795,"Mr. Speaker, the government has fought 752 ground fishers in court over the last five years over millions of dollars that are owed in back taxes to the fishers. After the government lost the court case, it has reluctantly agreed to settle. The problem is there are over 1,400 other fishers involved in the same program who are owed millions of dollars in back taxes. \lineBreak Will the government commit right now to pay back every single tax dollar that is owed to the ground fishers?","Mr. Speaker, service to all Canadians is important, and we have acted immediately after the court decision. We created a dedicated team to review each of the fishers' requests, and our expectation is that reassessments will begin to be issued in the coming weeks.  \lineBreak I would, however, like to point out that the member for "
1796,"Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but the parliamentary secretary is wrong. It is the Conservative government that has fought fishers in court for five years--",Order. The hon. member for Cardigan has the floor.
1797,"They hate to hear this, Mr. Speaker, but when the government lost the court case this year, the minister waited to the very last possible day before telling the fishers she would not appeal the case, fighting them tooth and nail to the last drop. \lineBreak Now there are over 1,400 other fishers in this program who have not received this money. Will the government assure the fishers today that they will be paid the millions of dollars owed to them, along with the 752 who have won the court case after five years?","Mr. Speaker, again, it is unfortunate that the Conservative government is having to clean up the Liberal mess on this issue.  \lineBreak However, I do want to reassure the House, because it is very important for the fishers, that a dedicated team has been set up to review each of the fishers' requests. Our expectation is that the reassessment will begin to be issued in the upcoming weeks."
1798,"Mr. Speaker, Conservatives promised there would be no cuts to the Public Health Agency of Canada, but now they have said there will be new criteria and a new application process for HIV-AIDS funding. The clock is ticking, yet the Conservatives still have not said what those criteria are, or even how to apply.  \lineBreak HIV-AIDS community organizations are now concerned they will have to close their doors and cut community services before they can even submit applications. Why are the Conservatives putting HIV-AIDS community services at risk?","Mr. Speaker, I want the member to know that I disagree with him. I am very proud of the work this government has accomplished in helping combat HIV-AIDS not only in Canada but in the world. The Canadian HIV vaccine initiative, for example, CHVI, led by our government along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, highlights Canada's world-class HIV and vaccine research expertise. This initiative will help our government advance the science for the development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine. In addition, last year alone our government provided $42 million in HIV-AIDS research funding through CIHR."
1799,"Mr. Speaker, HIV-AIDS organizations rely on this funding to offer help to Canadians. These organizations have already waited much longer than usual to get confirmation from the government that their funding would indeed be renewed.  \lineBreak Is this another example of the government's mismanagement, like all the other examples the Auditor General raised this week? Does this government plan to withdraw funding from HIV-AIDS organizations or not?","Mr. Speaker, I suppose the member did not hear my answer. Our government has taken a leadership role and has made unprecedented investments into research for people who have HIV and AIDS. The sad thing about it is each and every time we do that, NDP members stand in the House and vote against it. That is the sad state of affairs that this party has to deal with. We are committed to helping people who need help in our country and around the world with HIV and AIDS."
1800,"Mr. Speaker, Marine Atlantic Inc. offers commercial and passenger ferry services between the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. This is a vital service to those people living on Canada's eastern coast. \lineBreak On November 28 at one minute after midnight, Marine Atlantic Inc. and the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada, Local 4285, will acquire the legal right to strike or lock out. Can the ","Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Canadians have given our government a strong mandate to focus on the economy and to make sure that we do what we can to help Canada's recovery. \lineBreak In the case of Marine Atlantic, we are referring the matter to the Canadian Industrial Relations Board for its ruling on whether any activities need to be maintained because the ceasing of the activities would pose an immediate and serious danger to the public health and safety for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. I made that referral today."
1801,"Mr. Speaker, as we recall the Holodomor genocide in Ukraine nearly 80 years ago, we are also concerned about the fragile state of Ukrainian democracy today. Interference in the legal system is used to stifle free political activity and now some mysterious illness seems to have befallen the leader of the opposition. \lineBreak Will the Canadian government press Ukrainian authorities to allow Ms. Tymoshenko independent medical treatment? Will Canada offer to provide that treatment if necessary and will Ukraine be warned that anything untoward happening to Ms. Tymoshenko would severely affect relations with Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the member for "
1802,"Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada determined that the real market value of Île Lapierre was $14 million. A year earlier, the value of the island was estimated at $400,000. This island is essentially a dump. It has no ecological value. All of the officials who have worked on this file have said that it has no value. Yet businessman Alfonso Argento received $14 million in tax credits for this island. Fourteen million dollars for him, and $15 million for 85,000 volunteer firefighters. It is clear that the Conservative Party's friends are more important than volunteer firefighters.","Mr. Speaker, I did hear something about tax credits for volunteer firefighters, and that gives me the opportunity to remind all members in the House that it was only this side of the House that actually voted for that measure the other night. The NDP, and in fact all of the opposition, voted against it.  \lineBreak There are a lot of things wrong in the world. What we can do is help Canadians right now. We have offered Canadians incentives to get people back to work and tax credits to help them, but every time we do, those members vote against it."
1803,"Mr. Speaker, at committee yesterday, the  \lineBreak Would the minister rise in the House, apologize to 1.4 million unemployed Canadians today and reverse the decision about cutting the EI processing centres across this great country?","Mr. Speaker, our goal is to get EI cheques to people who are qualified for them just as quickly as possible. We have a standard. It is 28 days 80% of the time, and we are just a little below that right now.  \lineBreak I apologize if there was any confusion when the member opposite did not understand what all went into that statistic. However, we are changing the system because we want to improve it. We want to deliver services to Canadians better, faster, more efficiently and more affordably."
1804,"Mr. Speaker, our government's international focus continues to be deepening our trade relationships. Increased trade creates economic growth and jobs here in Canada. With one in five Canadian jobs generated by trade, this is a no-brainer. Despite these clear benefits, the NDP continues to lobby against the creation of Canadian jobs. \lineBreak Could the parliamentary secretary please explain to the House how the NDP views trade?","Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the NDP pretends to be mainstream, but its anti-trade agenda has no credibility.  \lineBreak Here is how the NDP views trade: exports means sending NDP MPs abroad to lobby against Canadian jobs; imports means flying socialists to Canada to criticize Canadians working in our oil sands.  \lineBreak The NDP's anti-trade, anti-Canadian jobs agenda is proof that the NDP is unfit to be the official opposition."
1805,"Mr. Speaker, we have seen what happens when the government and industry do not consult on major projects like the northern gateway.  \lineBreak The coastal first nations have made clear their opposition to the project and process. Now Kinder Morgan is proposing to double the Trans Mountain pipeline that would run through at least 15 first nation reserves and 30 traditional territories. Failure to negotiate in good faith has left a cloudy picture of rights and title in British Columbia. \lineBreak When will the minister commit to government-to-government talks with the affected first nations?","Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Our government, as the member knows, supports the diversification of our exports; however, we are committed to ensuring that any project is environmentally sustainable."
1806,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government was doing magic tricks yesterday to try to get people to forget its recent appointments of unilingual anglophones. By launching a consultative committee whose mandate and composition are not yet known—nor is it known whether this committee will report to Parliament—the government is embarking on useless consultations, since the problem is well known. I have a very simple suggestion that will save the government time and money: pass the only bill that the Bloc Québécois has ever introduced in this House, which makes employees of federally regulated businesses in Quebec subject to Bill 101. It is important to point this out. \lineBreak Will the government stop waffling and really protect French as the language of work in Quebec?","Mr. Speaker, we will continue promoting and protecting the French language, not just in Quebec, but also in Canada. The government announced that it will launch a consultative committee that will work on the ground to speak with Canadians and ensure that employees of federally regulated businesses in Quebec are fully able to work in French. We will examine the facts and take action if necessary. "
1807,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are flabbergasted to find out the Conservatives want to break our solemn commitment on the Kyoto protocol. Of the 191 countries that signed and ratified the Kyoto protocol agreement, Canada is the only country repudiating it. \lineBreak Canada's obligations under this agreement are legally binding. Canada's obligations to fight climate change are morally binding. Canada's obligations to future generations should be clear to all. \lineBreak How can the Conservatives justify abandoning Canada's legal and moral obligations to fight climate change? How can they betray future generations so irresponsibly?","Mr. Speaker, our government is balancing the need for a cleaner and healthier environment by protecting jobs and economic growth. We need an effective agreement. Effective means it must include large emitters. The Kyoto protocol does not include major emitters like China and the United States, and therefore will not work. \lineBreak Canada will not sign onto a new agreement that does not include all major emitters."
1808,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives set weak insipid targets and they did not even meet their own targets. They did not get the job done. \lineBreak Canada signed a legally binding international agreement. Instead of even trying to honour our word, Conservatives choose to abandon the Kyoto protocol. This is nothing less than environmental vandalism. This irresponsible action harms the planet, and kills the next generation of clean energy and Canadian jobs. \lineBreak Why will the government not be responsible, show leadership, and join the rest of the world in the fight against climate change? Why is it betraying Canadians' commitment to the environment?","Mr. Speaker, we are committed to reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and we are making good progress. \lineBreak Our government is balancing the need for a cleaner and healthier environment with protecting jobs and economic growth. We need an effective agreement, and that is why the major emitters must absolutely be at the table. The Kyoto protocol does not include major emitters like China and the United States and therefore will not work. Canada will not sign onto a new agreement that does not include all major emitters. "
1809,"Mr. Speaker, there is no balance. That is completely irresponsible. The Conservatives want to withdraw Canada from the Kyoto protocol and they will do so only after the summit in Durban. The Minister of the Environment's presence in Durban is a complete charade. He is going there to obstruct and stifle progress, derail talks and act like an environmental vandal. Even Brian Mulroney signed international treaties against climate change, so why are the Conservatives doing the opposite? Why are they betraying future generations? Why are they betraying the future of our planet?","Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the hon. member, it is strange to hear him use the word “balance”. We want to balance protecting the environment with creating jobs. A government cannot take into account both the environment and the economy with an election platform that advocates $10 billion in taxes, or an environmental platform that would increase gas by 10¢ a litre. \lineBreak Mr. Speaker, let us be clear: we need an effective agreement, which takes the major greenhouse gas emitters and the protocol—"
1810,"Order, please.  \lineBreak The hon. member for ","Mr. Speaker, the government's position makes no sense, whether from a legal, moral or scientific perspective. By opting out of Kyoto, Canada is cutting itself off from the rest of the world. Thus, it is sure to be left out of important decisions concerning the future of the planet. The Conservatives prefer to play by themselves in their oil-sands box. Why?"
1811,"On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. Canada is finding that a good number of countries are moving to our position. \lineBreak Canada is working toward a single new international climate change regime that will include all major international emitters, both developed and developing countries. \lineBreak At the same time, Canada continues to pursue our targets of reducing greenhouse gases by 17% by 2020.","On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. That was not an answer. The truth is that Conservative inaction on environment is killing Canadian jobs. Now the government is trying to change the channel by reannouncing its failed clean air agenda. The irresponsible government is making us a laughingstock internationally. \lineBreak Why will Conservatives not come clean with the world, why will Conservatives not come clean with Canadians, and why will they not admit that Canada is pulling out of Kyoto?"
1812,"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her lob question. It gives me a chance to say that I am extremely pleased to inform all of my hon. colleagues that we have renewed the clean air regulatory agenda. \lineBreak We will provide $600 million over the next five years in scientific research, monitoring, modelling, regulation, and enforcement required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other toxic pollutants. \lineBreak Our government can balance both environmental stewardship and protecting the economy.","Mr. Speaker, I am sure the government wants to be honest, straightforward and transparent, and that is what leads me to ask a very simple question. \lineBreak If it is the intention of the Government of Canada to renege on a treaty that was ratified by the Parliament of Canada, why would the Government of Canada not say so now? Why would it not just bring it forward for debate in Parliament now? Why not do it before it goes through the charade of participating in the conference in Durban? Why such a double standard?"
1813,"Mr. Speaker, talking about honesty, let us not forget that under the Liberals Canada's GHG emissions increased by 27% to 33% over Kyoto targets. Under the Liberals, Canada's total carbon dioxide emissions increased by 28 points per capita. \lineBreak Our government is balancing the need for a cleaner and healthier environment by protecting jobs and economic growth.

What is on the table? \lineBreak Every single time the ","Mr. Speaker, I know this member understands that it is tremendously important that trade across our borders is open, that manufacturing sectors, particularly in southern Ontario and southern Quebec, can get their products back and forth across the border. \lineBreak Canada is a trading nation, and this government is focused on jobs and the economy like a laser. We want to ensure that we deal with some of the challenges that employers have in getting their goods and services across the border. That is why we are working very closely with the Obama administration on a deal to try to address some of these challenges that are affecting both of our economies. \lineBreak We are going to continue those discussions and hope to have something in short order."
1815,"The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that the Conservatives put us in a major trade deficit. It is costing jobs and it must be stopped. From softwood lumber to buy American, every time the government tries to negotiate a deal with the U.S., Canada comes out the big loser. This time the privacy of Canadians is at stake. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives finally stop their secret negotiations and tell Canadians what will be sacrificed in this deal? What are the Conservatives willing to give up just to push through this deal with the United States?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians' right to privacy is something that this government respects and strongly supports but we also strongly support Canadian sovereignty. This is not an issue where Canada needs the United States. This is an issue where we need to work together to ensure that we protect jobs on both sides of the border. That could be more important in no other area of the country than his own constituency of "
1816,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the head the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police made it clear that the government's prisons agenda is unbalanced. He said, “Is there a balance needed? Absolutely”. Police chiefs know that keeping our streets safe must include a strategy for crime prevention, something they say that Bill C-10 just does not do. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives dead set on ignoring our police chiefs and ramming through this unbalanced prisons agenda?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member has been, but we have had a complete approach. Our national crime prevention strategy, the national anti-drug strategy, the aboriginal justice system and drug courts are all part of it. However, getting tough on violent criminals is also part of our agenda, and I am very proud of our complete approach in this area."
1817,"Mr. Speaker, ignoring our chiefs of police is a new low. The government is about to pass an irresponsible prisons agenda that our top cops insist lacks the proper balance. Police officers say that they cannot keep communities safe without a focus on crime prevention. The provinces are saying the same thing and so is the opposition, yet the government refuses to listen. \lineBreak Why does the government not care what our chiefs of police think about crime prevention? Why is it burdening provincial budgets with this unbalanced approach?","Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that  every attempt to get tough on crime will not have the support of the NDP. However, I am very pleased and proud of the support that we have received from police and police chiefs. He can selectively quote whatever he wants, but law enforcement agencies across this country know that we are on the right track, that we are standing up for victims and that we are giving them the tools they need to fight crime in this country."
1818,"Mr. Speaker, this government is preparing to eliminate all restrictions on extremely dangerous firearms, such as long-range rifles and semi-automatic assault weapons. Consequently, it will be easier to purchase such deadly weapons as the Steyr HS .50, which can pierce a bulletproof vest from a distance of over 1.5 km. The Conservatives are eliminating tools that the police need to protect us. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives undertake to maintain control over the sale of weapons used primarily to commit crimes?","Mr. Speaker, it is very disappointing that the NDP is left with no argument to defend the long gun registry and resorts to trying to mislead Canadians. There are no changes in Bill "
1819,"Mr. Speaker, why should I expect an answer that makes sense from a completely senseless government that will not listen to reason? \lineBreak There is no justification for eliminating restrictions on powerful weapons that have absolutely nothing to do with hunting. The Conservatives could not care less about the advice of the RCMP, the provinces and their own advisors, who are saying that Bill  \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives want to make things easier for criminals at any cost?","Mr. Speaker, we were very pleased to hear from front-line officers over the last couple of weeks who overwhelmingly supported abolishing the long gun registry. They have asked us to get tough on violent criminals and those who prey on our children, which is what we are asking the NDP to support instead of trying to perpetuate this misleading information regarding Bill "
1820,"Mr. Speaker, this government lacks vision. Rather than working with the NDP to quickly pass Bill  \lineBreak Coming from a government that has invoked closure eight times since Parliament resumed, this announcement has us doubting the government's motives. \lineBreak Why make the process longer rather than taking action?","Mr. Speaker, the French language is an integral part of our history, our identity and our daily life. We are very proud of it. French is one of the founding languages of Canada. \lineBreak However, we must not confuse the issue. The NDP has not done its homework and is now proposing to create useless and cumbersome paperwork for these entities. We have to be serious about this matter and conduct consultations to see whether there is a problem with the language of work at private entities that come under federal jurisdiction. That is what we will do and we will do it the right way."
1821,"Mr. Speaker, I feel like I am watching an improve skit set up by Yvan Ponton. \lineBreak The Conservatives are proposing to set up a committee with an unspecified mandate, unknown membership and an undetermined budget. That is a waste of time and money. \lineBreak Do they not know that by voting with us at second reading, they will send the bill to a committee already funded by the House? \lineBreak If the Conservatives are serious about this and really want to protect the French language in federally regulated businesses, why do they not vote with the NDP to send Bill ","Mr. Speaker, the NDP should first do its homework instead of inventing situations to get the day's news clip by improvising policies about such a sensitive issue. What we must do is conduct consultations. That is why we will strike an advisory committee to conduct consultations about whether the language of work is an issue in federally regulated private businesses. We will do this the right way. It is not true that we will bungle the job on such a sensitive issue for purely partisan and political reasons."
1822,"Mr. Speaker, after pressure from the Ontario New Democrats, the McGuinty government has agreed to extend the deadline for the stimulus program for three Hamilton projects and is now calling on the federal government to be reasonable and grant the same common sense extension.  \lineBreak These projects are vital to Hamilton. Will the government be reasonable and grant the extension?","Mr. Speaker, as we have said before, the date has to be respected. It was over two and a half years to deliver thousands of projects all around this country, which what most municipalities have done. I am sorry, but the date was the date, and it is over."
1823,"Mr. Speaker, recently the Conservative government has shown a big appetite to change long-standing institutional names, so I might suggest one: changing the minister responsible for EI from “employment insurance” to “erroneous information” because last week, in the Charlottetown  \lineBreak She now knows full well that what she said was totally untrue. Could she tell the House today how long it is taking people who are eligible for EI to get their first payment?","Mr. Speaker, I did address this issue last week. We are facing challenges meeting the needs of Canadians. We are investing in new systems, in automation and in upgrading of our systems so we can respond to Canadians in a timely manner, because they all deserve and need certain benefits in a timely manner."
1824,"Mr. Speaker, I still do not think she understands the situation. I asked her the question on the indicator and she had a Charlie Sheen moment, handing the wheel over to her deputy. \lineBreak The speed indicator measures two things: the time it takes for the payment to be issued and the time it takes for notice of non-payment to be issued. It is tough putting oil in the tank and food in the fridge with a notice of non-payment.  \lineBreak The minister misrepresented that particular statistic as if everybody was getting a cheque in 23 days. Will the minister stand today, correct the record and tell us how long unemployed Canadians are—","Order, please. The hon. Minister of Human Resources."
1825,"Mr. Speaker, the facts are the facts. On average, 80% of the time, people do get their cheques within 23 days. It is those who are eligible for cheques who receive them. Mr. Speaker, you do not receive one in 23 days because you are not eligible. \lineBreak We are trying to improve on this because Canadians do need better than that and we want to be there to help them in their time of need.","Mr. Speaker, the minister has no clue. She talks about effectiveness and efficiencies but she should check her departmental statistics: speed of EI payment, worst rate in five years; EI call service level, worst performance in six years; average EI processing time, worst in the last five years; percentage of calls being hung up on, the highest in six years. When people call and press 2 to get an attendant, they actually have a better chance of being hung up on.

1827,"Order, please. The hon. minister has the floor.","Mr. Speaker, we are trying to help them achieve better service levels because Canadians need and deserve that, especially in their time of need."
1828,"Mr. Speaker, the current health accord says that funding commitments require that jurisdictions comply with reporting provisions. The Conservatives have failed to live up to this commitment. The minister says that the next accord will be about accountability but, without reporting, she cannot tell us what the current accords have achieved.  \lineBreak The government is sleepwalking into the next accord, blind to what happened under the last one. Where is the accountability now?","Mr. Speaker, I had very productive meetings with the health ministers this past Friday. We discussed many important issue, such as obesity, suicide prevention, mental health and MS.  \lineBreak Minister Bolduc, Quebec's health minister, said that he felt there was excellent collaboration among the provinces and the federal government. He felt that we were listening to them.  \lineBreak That is great news. It reflects the success of our discussions and advances that we have made together to better the health care system for all Canadians. Our government will not be like the previous Liberal government that slashed health and education transfers to the provinces."
1829,"Mr. Speaker, the minister failed to address the key issue. The federal government has invested almost $160 billion in health care under the current accord. However, because of the government's mismanagement, Canadians do not know what value they are getting. The government has failed to ensure proper reporting on the impact of that spending.  \lineBreak Much of what the Conservatives promised, a pharmaceutical strategy, public health strategy and long-term care, are nowhere in sight. When will they finally demonstrate some leadership on this accord? Why wait until 2014 to be accountable?","Mr. Speaker, what was not stated in that statement is that the 2004 accord also required a committee to review the accomplishments. That work is currently being carried out in the Senate. I am looking forward to receiving the findings of the review from the Senate committee, which will be completing that report in the next month or so. \lineBreak One of our goals is to ensure there is accountability in the way the money is being spent. I will continue to work with the provinces and territories in the delivery of health care to their residents."
1830,"Mr. Speaker, this government's record on health is appalling. Not only has it been unable to have current health accord commitments honoured, but now the  \lineBreak Will the minister do the responsible thing and intervene in order to ensure that we do not have to pay more for our medication?","Mr. Speaker, the meeting I had on Friday was a great opportunity to hear about what the provinces are doing to improve health care in their jurisdictions. Minister MacDonald, Nova Scotia's health minister, told the media that the meetings were very productive and that the discussions focused on issues that are important to all jurisdictions. The minister from Quebec also said that there was very good harmony among all partners. They all had the same goal and that was to improve the health outcomes for all Canadians."
1831,"Mr. Speaker, the problem is that this issue relates to the CETA, not the provinces. If this is the government's idea of defending the interests of Canadians, so much for that. \lineBreak We will have to spend an estimated $2.8 billion more a year on drugs if Canada signs this agreement with the EU, and Canadians will receive nothing in return: no access to better drugs, generic drugs or low prices.  \lineBreak Why is the minister taking this file so lightly without showing any leadership? Why is she defending large pharmaceutical companies instead of Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, I absolutely disagree with the premise of the hon. member's question.  \lineBreak I would remind the hon. member opposite that our government always protects and advances Canada's interests during international negotiations, and we will only enter into an agreement that is in Canada's best interest. We will continue to consult closely with Canadian stakeholders and with provincial and territorial governments with respect to all issues regarding the CETA with the European Union.  \lineBreak The benefits to Canadians are clear: a trade agreement with the European Union is expected to boost Canada's economy by $12 billion and increase two-way trade by 20%."
1832,"Mr. Speaker, today the  \lineBreak Could the minister please outline the importance of passing Bill C-18 as quickly as possible?","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the member for  \lineBreak This is a tremendous day. This is a movement forward. This is what we have been waiting for for decades. We will get the job done tonight. "
1833,"Mr. Speaker, looming civilian staff cuts at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier are causing concern in my riding because 1,400 civilians who work on the base might lose their jobs. These are civilians who play an important role and allow the Canadian Forces to do their work effectively and safely. \lineBreak Can the minister tell us here and now whether he intends to cut jobs at Valcartier?","Mr. Speaker, like all departments, the Department of National Defence is looking across the board at our budgets. We are looking at individual efforts to find efficiencies. With respect to managing the workforce, we want to ensure we have the right people in the right place at the right cost to taxpayers. This includes always examining a range of options to find processes designed to increase those efficiencies to ensure we are making smart decisions on behalf of the government and, most importantly, on behalf of taxpayers. "
1834,"Mr. Speaker, the people of Valcartier who are worried about losing their jobs because of cuts by this government cannot wait and see what happens and wait while the government wastes its time with such studies. \lineBreak Last month, we learned that the Department of National Defence was considering selling some of its properties and closing some facilities as a cost-cutting measure. \lineBreak The minister refused to answer Canadians' questions then, so I am asking him again: will the minister promise to keep all the bases open?","Mr. Speaker, as with issues related to families and businesses, the Government of Canada is continuing to review its resources in an effort to find effective solutions. \lineBreak We are in a position, obviously, with the slowing of the global economy, to make important smart decisions on behalf of taxpayers. What does not help is when members of the opposition, as the member just did, get up and cast fear and doubt across communities and across bases in this country. "
1835,"Mr. Speaker, perhaps the minister will tell us how many bases will have to close when the government is forced to pay the true costs of the F-35s.
							 \lineBreak Norway has acknowledged that the true cost of their 52 F-35s will be $40 billion or more. Are the Conservatives so blindly committed to the F-35 boondoggle because someone in Washington told them so, or are they prepared to act independently in our national interest and put this out for tender?","Mr. Speaker, I do not know how many times we need to repeat the same end story.  \lineBreak The F-35 did go out to competition. It won out. Our government's preference is to put our trust in our pilots and materiel experts who know the importance of the F-35 program, which is producing the 21st century fighter our military needs while at the same time sustaining quality aerospace jobs across Canada."
1836,"Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to hear the government admit to such blind adherence to Liberal government policy, but it was, after all, the associate minister who turned a Liberal procurement initiative into his own, and I quote, “crusade”.  \lineBreak National Defence is facing a fiscal crunch. Instead of cutting back on bases and instead of cuts to navy operations, why will the government not agree to have a competition to replace the F-18s? When will it put this deal out to tender?","Mr. Speaker, all reasonable people agree that we need aircraft to defend Canada's sovereignty. Our plan is on track. An extensive and rigorous competition has taken place. It happened, as was stated, under the previous Liberal government. If the opposition members had their way, they would cancel the equipment our air force agrees is the best our men and women need to do their job effectively, efficiently and safely."
1837,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak  Why are the Conservatives misleading Canadians and the international community by trying to hide the fact that they are actually negotiating in bad faith?","Mr. Speaker, that question from the Liberals is pretty rich, given that Kyoto represents one of the biggest blunders of the previous Liberal government. They made it even worse by cynically embracing Kyoto while knowing they would never work to fulfill their obligations.  \lineBreak In Durban, Canada will continue to work to encourage the international community to embrace a new international climate change agreement that includes all major emitters."
1838,"Mr. Speaker, the City of Calgary negotiated in good faith with the federal government for three years to build badly needed recreation centres in fast-growing parts of the city. The city spent millions as part of the application process. Mayor Nenshi has pointed to the Conservative government's bad faith on this issue. Why did the Conservatives pull the plug, and why are they taking Calgary for granted?","Mr. Speaker, PPP Canada Inc. is a great arm's-length organization that analyzes all sorts of projects all across this country. We are looking forward to some of these investments that will help municipalities with their water and their sewers and their major infrastructure projects.  \lineBreak The projects in Calgary actually did not qualify for P3 funding at this time."
1839,"Mr. Speaker, unfortunately that answer will not help Calgary families. If they were not going to receive funding, why were they not told three years ago? \lineBreak The City of Calgary was told the project only needed political approval. If recreation centres were not eligible for funding, why did the government's website say they were? Why was this information mysteriously removed from the website just hours after the mayor's press conference?  \lineBreak Calgary families are waiting for an answer. When will the Conservatives come clean?","Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the opposition stands up and asks questions about PPP Canada Inc. when, if we go back in history, those members actually voted against putting PPP Canada Inc. in place as an arm's-length organization that would analyze infrastructure requirements across this country and look at a new concept of partnering with other levels of government and the private sector to fulfill the infrastructure requirements of these communities.  \lineBreak I would encourage those members to support some of these investments, rather than criticizing them."
1840,"Mr. Speaker, today the NDP unveiled a new ad campaign targeting our government's commitment to end the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all. The ad claims that there are “no more safeguards” for dangerous firearms--",Once again I will ask hon. members to hold off on their applause until either the end of the question or maybe until the end of the minister's answer. \lineBreak The hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie has the floor.
1841,"Mr. Speaker, the ad claims there are “no more safeguards” for dangerous firearms.This is a laughably preposterous and illogical statement, as firearms licensing remains unchanged. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for  \lineBreak The NDP clearly does not understand the Canadian firearms program or does not understand classification. The firearm in the ad that was leaked to the media this weekend is clearly a restricted firearm.  \lineBreak Why is the NDP misleading Canadians instead of speaking the truth? It is because there is no valid argument in support of the long gun registry, so those members resort to half-truths and misinformation."
1842,"Mr. Speaker, the excellent work done by our armed forces in Afghanistan would not have been possible without the help of the Afghan interpreters who put their lives and those of their families at risk in order to help Canada. Although they were promised refugee status in Canada, two-thirds of the interpreters who have applied have had their applications refused. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives abandoning those who helped Canada at a very difficult time and who put their lives and those of their families at risk to help our armed forces?","Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that our government recognizes these brave and courageous Afghans. They made a significant contribution to our mission and saved Canadian lives. \lineBreak That is why we introduced the special visa program: to help former translators facing exceptional risk or serious injuries to bring their families to Canada. That program allowed for 450 interpreters and their families, but we have expanded it by almost 20%. Now 550 Afghan interpreters and their families are able to come to this country to find safety, security and a new life in our country."
1843,"Mr. Speaker, The families of cyclists and pedestrians killed in truck collisions joined me this morning to call on the minister to mandate side guards. \lineBreak Karen Hartmann talked about her pain in losing her husband when he was crushed, and her daughter described life without her father. Four different studies from the EU, Germany and the UK showed side guards reduce fatalities by up to 50%. \lineBreak How many more preventable deaths will it take for the government to act?","Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and support go out to all those who have been involved in tragic bicycle and pedestrian accidents. \lineBreak We are always looking at ways to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety in the presence of motor vehicles."
1844,"Mr. Speaker, today, the Egyptian people have had the chance to experience democracy for the first time in more than 30 years, in multi-party elections. Freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law are principles that our government stands firmly behind and are something that was not an option under the former Mubarak regime. \lineBreak As many of my constituents are watching closely, could the ","Mr. Speaker, the courage and the determination of the Egyptian people are a real example for the world. Our hearts and minds are with them today as they undertake a democratic transition. We want to wish them well in exercising the legitimate right to represent those who govern themselves. \lineBreak This morning I met with the Egyptian ambassador and underlined Canada's wish that the transition to democracy continue without delay and that the basic rights of Egyptians would be respected. We stand with the people of Egypt and look forward to working with them in this democratic transition."
1845,"Mr. Speaker, in a disturbing pattern, the government continues to abandon Canadians detained abroad. Henk Tepper, a New Brunswick potato farmer, has been in prison for eight months in Beirut, even though he has not been charged with any crime. His health is deteriorating, yet our officials have visited him only once. This man remains jailed, without any charges. \lineBreak Why does the government refuse to protect Canadian citizens abroad and will the minister intervene and ensure his safe return before Christmas?","Mr. Speaker, the government remains concerned about and I assure the House is very active in Mr. Tepper's case. We know that this is a very difficult time for Mr. Tepper and his family. However, based on information we have received, public profile would not be in Mr. Tepper's best interests at this point."
1846,"Mr. Speaker, a new round of climate change negotiations is starting today, and the Conservatives' position is contradictory to say the least. \lineBreak On the one hand, the minister claims that he will be “tough” on developing countries that are not doing their part, but on the other hand, he plans on abandoning our formal Kyoto commitments. As the environment commissioner said, the only thing that the government has managed to lower is its own greenhouse gas reduction targets.  \lineBreak Who is the minister trying to kid by saying that he will urge developing countries to do their part, when Canada itself is an environmental delinquent?","Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. \lineBreak Canada is working to create a single new international climate change regime, which includes commitments made by all the major emitters. \lineBreak We are working with our international colleagues to create a new international climate change agreement that  will include all major emitters."
1847," Mr. Speaker, last Thursday the member for  \lineBreak A little further, we read: \lineBreak I think that is clear enough. To put things in perspective, I will also reread my statement to make certain that everyone sees that the words I spoke were found in the remarks of the hon. member for  \lineBreak I would like to read my statement, which will not take very long—","I think the hon. member has had enough time to present her argument, but the Chair believes that this disagreement over facts is not a valid point of order. I shall end the discussion now. \lineBreak The hon. member for "
1848,"Mr. Speaker, this government does not realize how serious the unemployment problem is, and at the same time, it is guilty of excessive spending. \lineBreak The government is wasting money on baubles and trinkets. The  \lineBreak How can the government justify such excessive spending on baubles and trinkets?","Mr. Speaker, this government strongly believes in supporting and recognizing Canadian history. It strongly believes in supporting and acknowledging the head of state of Canada, and certainly has made a number of initiatives in this regard. We think these are good things for Canada and we strongly support them."
1849,"Mr. Speaker, now that the minister is talking about jobs, let us talk about jobs. \lineBreak The real rate of unemployment today in Canada is 10%, which means that there are two million unemployed in Canada, people who are discouraged, who have stopped looking for work, and who are actually out of work. It is two million people. \lineBreak I would like to ask the minister a simple question. Why is it that the only initiative that the government is planning to take on January 1, 2012, is a middle-class tax increase? How can the government possibly justify that when there are two million unemployed Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, our economic action plan is working. Close to 600,000 net new jobs have been created since 2009. \lineBreak I must remind the House that the Liberals refused to support our budget. They walked away from the family caregiver tax credit, the children's arts tax credit, the volunteer firefighters tax credit, tax relief for the manufacturing sector, a tax credit for small businesses that creates jobs, and making the gas tax fund permanent. \lineBreak This is what the Liberals walked away from."
1850,"Mr. Speaker, it has taken a month-long state of emergency for the government to finally wake up to the crisis at Attawapiskat. Children and entire families are living in tents and dilapidated sheds with no heat and are now exposed to dropping temperatures. Attawapiskat families have lived like this for years. They need more than band-aid solutions.  \lineBreak Why will the government not work with the community on a long-term infrastructure solution before winter sets in, right now? Why is it letting the Red Cross do the job?","Mr. Speaker, reasonable Canadians agree that the people of Attawapiskat deserve warm, dry and safe shelter. Since coming to office, our government has invested over $92 million in Attawapiskat. That is $52,000 for every man, woman and child. We are not getting the results that we thought we should get.  \lineBreak I have officials in the community, and they are making progress to ensure people are appropriately housed. "
1851,"Mr. Speaker, last week that minister was blaming the Attawapiskat community for the problems.  \lineBreak The crisis in Attawapiskat is just one example of what happens when the government turns its back on the first nations. \lineBreak Half a million people live on reserves and many of them do not have heat or running water. The AFN estimates needs at $160 million a year. \lineBreak Why does this deficit exist? Where is the plan to help Attawapiskat and other first nations communities?","Mr. Speaker, we have invested in water infrastructure across the country in an unprecedented fashion. We have spent $2.5 billion since we formed government on water and waste water systems.  \lineBreak We will be tabling legislation in this House to make sure we have enforceable standards and regulations for water and waste water. We are developing a plan that will take care of people in Attawapiskat in the short term, and that is what is needed."
1852,"Mr. Speaker, there are 19 families living in tents and sheds with no running water. There are 122 families living in condemned housing. There are 96 people living in a large trailer.  \lineBreak The Red Cross has gone up there and is due to arrive in the community. It will be providing generators, heaters, winter clothing and insulated sleeping equipment. The Government of Ontario has sent teams from the emergency management scheme in the province. \lineBreak I would like to ask the ","Mr. Speaker, as the minister already pointed out, since coming to office, this government has spent some $90 million just on Attawapiskat. That is over $50,000 for every man, woman and child in the community. Obviously, we are not very happy that the results do not seem to have been achieved for that. We are concerned about that. We have officials looking into it and taking action. "
1853,"Mr. Speaker, in fact, the number the  \lineBreak It would seem that the implication of what the  \lineBreak When will the government start taking responsibility for this deplorable situation, which is an embarrassment to the reputation of the entire country?","What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, is that the Liberal Party's suggestion of simply throwing money is not the solution.  \lineBreak This government has made significant investments and has taken its responsibility seriously. This government will continue to do so. We will make sure we get the results we need."
1854,"Mr. Speaker, it is disgraceful for a government to waste money like the Conservatives did to host a party for representatives of visiting countries when there are people with nowhere to live, no heat and no work. They do not have the absolute basic living conditions that everyone in Canada should have. \lineBreak When will the government accept the responsibilities it has under the Constitution and its moral obligations with regard to the conditions that exist in our country's major cities? ","Mr. Speaker, when this government spends $50,000 for each person in the community for a total of over $90 million, it is not wasting money. We expect to achieve results and we will work with communities to ensure that we do."
1855,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the South African high commissioner spoke about the reports that Canada may be withdrawing from Kyoto. She called the move disturbing and disappointing. She said it will undermine the negotiating process at Durban because Canada has not only planned a withdrawal, but has actively lobbied other countries to do the same. \lineBreak The minister has admitted he has no intention to negotiate a new climate deal, and he has not denied his intention to withdraw from Kyoto. At the same time, the minister has said that his intentions in Durban are not to derail the negotiations on climate. Will the minister tell us what his intentions really are?","Mr. Speaker, instead of talking about intentions, let us talk about real action with regard to climate change: $250 million to support regulatory activities to address climate change and $86 million to support clean energy regulatory reforms. New Democrats voted against this."
1856,"Mr. Speaker, why do I not take a crack at deciphering what the intentions are?  \lineBreak We know that the Conservatives are waiting until December 23 to announce their withdrawal from Kyoto. If a country withdraws from the agreement, it does not take effect for one year. That means that Canada can try to sabotage the negotiations this year in Durban and next year in Qatar.  \lineBreak It is this kind of behaviour that denigrates and undermines Canada's reputation internationally. Will the minister admit that this is his plan?","Mr. Speaker, agreements that do not include major emitters like China and the United States will not work. That is why we remain committed to reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. We are making good progress through tangible action that we have taken here at home. We are proud of this record."
1857,"Mr. Speaker, by neglecting the environment, this government is jeopardizing the health of our families and of the economy. The Conservatives are turning their backs on the international community so that they do not have to be accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions. Reneging on their commitments to Canadians and other countries is a strategy that hurts everyone. \lineBreak Why is the government refusing to table a credible plan that takes the environment and the economy into account?","Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleague opposite has acknowledged a fundamental point. We need to balance our environment and the economy and this is what we are doing. This is a principle that the opposition would gladly throw to the wind when it denigrates our oil sands sector.  \lineBreak Our government's sector-by-sector approach, which is being developed by a robust consultation process, is designed to meet a tangible target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, while being cognizant of Canada's economic growth. This approach is prudent and action focused and we are proud of it."
1858,"Mr. Speaker, after seeing the Conservatives drag their feet for six years, major trade partners are slamming doors in our face. They disapprove of the government's environmental choices. Not only are the Conservatives isolating us from the rest of the world, but their inaction is costing us jobs here in Canada. \lineBreak Why does this government refuse to understand that it is possible to create good-quality jobs while investing in clean energies, as our partners are doing?","Mr. Speaker, $40 million for Sustainable Development Technology Canada was included in this year's budget. Again, our government is committed to clean energy and the New Democrats keep voting against measures to support it."
1859,"Mr. Speaker, Conservatives are not only dropping the ball internationally but also here at home.  \lineBreak Under the secret deal the government is negotiating, Americans will have new powers to track Canadians. The government is keeping us in the dark about what this means for Canadians' privacy. The Privacy Commissioner is calling for more transparency, saying we should enter into the border deal with both eyes wide open, but the government is pulling the wool over the eyes of Canadians. \lineBreak When will it tell us what is on the table?","Mr. Speaker, work is in progress with the Obama administration to try to establish an agreement that protects and promotes jobs in this country. We want more economic growth, and we do not want the border to become a wall. We want more trade and more jobs here in Canada. That is important for every part of this country, but nowhere is it more important than in Windsor, Ontario, where the auto sector desperately needs less congestion at the border. \lineBreak We are committed to continuing to fight for jobs in Canada and we are committed to working with the Obama administration."
1860,"Mr. Speaker, we all know that when the government negotiates with Americans, it is Canadian families that lose, and jobs that are lost. \lineBreak Protecting Canadians does not mean hiding the truth from them. However, that is what the government is doing, in softwood lumber, buy American, thickening the border, and the list goes on and on. Now our privacy is at risk. Why can the government not come clean with Canadians and show what is being negotiated away in the secret deal?","Mr. Speaker, this is a work in progress. Work continues and when we have an announcement to make, I will certainly do that. \lineBreak Let me say this. We strongly believe in the rights of Canadians, in Canadian sovereignty and in privacy. These are the types of values we bring to the negotiating table. What is beyond dispute is that we have to protect Canadian jobs, and we have to promote policies that will help job creation and economic growth. That is why this government is focused like no other government among the G7; it is getting results for the economy. We are going to continue to work hard to protect Canadian jobs."
1861,"Mr. Speaker, the government's prisons agenda in  \lineBreak Why is the government's approach to go it alone? Why do the Conservatives refuse to work with others on crime prevention and insist on rushing through this flawed bill?","First of all, Mr. Speaker, when we want to talk police officers we only have to consult with our own caucus here because of all the police officers who are part of the Conservative caucus. \lineBreak That being said, as long as the hon. member is raising the matter, Chief Vern White, from the Ottawa Police Service, said, “We do believe that minimum sentences in relation to the charges or offences identified in this legislation would assist us”. \lineBreak Superintendent Don Spicer, from the Halifax Regional Police, said, “The current sentencing norms simply do not reflect the public's expectations and the only way for Parliament to achieve balance is through mandatory minimums”. \lineBreak This should have the support of the hon. member and everyone in this House."
1862,"Mr. Speaker, the opposition has put forth practical amendments that will make our communities safer. Why will the Conservatives not vote for these? Why are they barrelling ahead on this unbalanced approach of going it alone? Where is the commitment to the police chiefs who are calling for a balance, to our provincial partners and to families who want to see more front-line police to keep our streets safe?  \lineBreak How much are taxpayers going to have to pay for this prisons agenda just because the Conservatives are incapable of working with others?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member never asked what victims will have to pay if we do not change the laws.  \lineBreak The NDP has trouble with the idea of going after violent criminals and child pornographers and those who molest children. Why do they not stop attacking farmers who want to sell their wheat or have a long gun? Why not start attacking violent criminals just to mix it up for a change?"
1863,"Mr. Speaker, they will say just about anything. We have already voted for harsher sentences for pedophiles.  \lineBreak By going against the recommendations of the provinces and experts, the Conservatives are preparing to throw hundreds of millions of dollars out the window, not to mention putting all those people in jail without it having a deterrent effect. To act in this way is to ignore Quebec's 40 years of expertise in rehabilitation. The government claims to be tough on crime, but imposing this bill will only make the situation worse and will stick the provinces with an enormous bill. \lineBreak Will this government realize that this money does not belong to it but to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, we recognize that Quebec has jurisdiction over criminal justice and can take action with regard to rehabilitation. In fact, Minister Fournier came to see us and we agreed to one of the three recommendations he made. What is more interesting is that Premier Charest sent two of his ministers to try to discuss the necessary amendments. \lineBreak Why did he not have faith in the NDP opposition?"
1864,"Mr. Speaker, this fall the minister said inaction on greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a “cataclysmic day”. Despite this understanding, all the government has done on climate change is slash programs and take Canada backwards.  \lineBreak Now we learn that the government is signalling its withdrawal from its international climate obligations. If the minister accepts that climate change is real, as he claims, and the government promises accountability and transparency, why is it planning to withdraw after the Durban conference?","Mr. Speaker, let us talk about something that is cataclysmic: signing on to an international accord with no plans to implement it. That is what a Liberal government would do.  \lineBreak Let us talk about its record. Under the Liberal government, Canada's carbon dioxide emissions rose between 1997 and 2005. We have a plan, an action plan and it is working."
1865,"Mr. Speaker, to distract us from the minister's incompetence and to counter its miserable record on the environment, this government has announced with gusto a paltry $120 million annually to fight climate change in Canada. In the past three years, Quebec alone has invested almost twice that amount, $200 million per year. \lineBreak Do the Conservatives really believe that such a pittance will make us forget the six years of inaction, obstruction, ignorance and bad faith?","Mr. Speaker, I would encourage the colleague opposite to actually read the budget before voting against it. What is included in the budget is $252 million to support regulatory activities to address climate change and air quality. I could go through the list of the hundreds of millions of dollars that we have prudently invested to take care of Canada's environment, a record of which we are proud."
1866,"Mr. Speaker, the former chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board is pointing to an alarming trend in tribunal decisions. Ninety per cent of appointments were made by the Conservatives. We have the lowest rate of refugee approvals in Canadian history. Refugee cases should be based on merit and need, but the former chair is accusing the  \lineBreak  Why is the government tainting a system that should be independent and fair?","To the contrary, Mr. Speaker, this government put in place by far the most rigorous pre-selection and screening process for appointees to the IRB in the history of our asylum system. Only 10% of the people who apply for membership in the IRB make it through the independent and arm's-length pre-screening process. I can attest to the quality of those individuals. I have been responsible for recommending over 140 appointments or reappointments and all of these individuals have made it through this rigorous, independent pre-screening process."
1867,"Mr. Speaker, maybe the  \lineBreak When will the ","Mr. Speaker, again, 90% of people who apply for membership in the IRB do not make it through the pre-screening process. Only 10% are recommended. That is one out of every ten."
1868,"Mr. Speaker, on Friday we learned that the government plans to slash $31.5 million from immigration settlement services in Ontario. Community organizations are already struggling because of similar cuts last year and the year before. Ontario remains the number one destination for immigration in Canada. Why is the government making it harder for newcomers to access the services that they need?","To the contrary, Mr. Speaker. We are now providing three times more in funding for immigrant settlement services in Ontario than was the case under the previous Liberal government. Next year, Ontario newcomers will receive more than was the case in 2005. It is true, however, that the number of immigrants settling in Ontario has declined quite significantly, from 64% to 52% of newcomers. They are going to other provinces; it is only fair that the settlement dollars follow the newcomers and that we have fair funding across the country."
1869,"Mr. Speaker, the minister says he is doing better than bad. I guess that is the level that the government has set for itself. \lineBreak With this shuffling of funds, we are still looking at an overall cut of $6 million and $45 million in cuts from two years ago, but the number of newcomers is at an all-time high. Pitting province against province is not going to solve the deficit. \lineBreak This decision to cut services in Ontario was done without planning and with no warning. New Canadians are huge contributors to prosperity in this country. Will the minister maintain the key supports and services they need to thrive in this country?","Mr. Speaker, the premise of the question is completely inaccurate. There has been a great deal of planning by my officials over the course of two years to ensure that the adjustment in funding from Ontario to provinces with growing immigration numbers happens in an orderly fashion. \lineBreak In terms of giving people notice, we just gave notice this week to the small number of organizations in Ontario that will be affected at the beginning of the next fiscal year. We have given them several months' notice. \lineBreak The question is, why does the member think that newcomers to Ontario should be receiving $4,000 per capita in settlement services but that those in the rest of the country should receive only $3,000? We believe that newcomers all across Canada deserve the same support."
1870,"Mr. Speaker, our government has always believed that western Canadian grain farmers deserve marketing freedom. We have always believed in property rights and that farmers deserve to determine how and when they will market their produce. \lineBreak Yesterday was third reading of Bill  \lineBreak  Farmers want freedom. Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  \lineBreak Yesterday history was made in the House when members of Parliament passed Bill  \lineBreak Bill "
1871,"Mr. Speaker, the government's out-of-touch management has brought the RCMP to a crisis point. There was bullying of the provinces in contract negotiations, there were allegations of pervasive sexual harassment, and now there are questions about whether there are enough front-line officers to protect Canadians.  \lineBreak The RCMP's annual budget has doubled over the last decade. RCMP headquarters is bursting at the seams. Why has the growth in front-line officers not kept pace?","Mr. Speaker, I might remind the member that it was our government that hired 1,800 new front-line RCMP officers and provided $400 million to provinces to recruit officers. The former Liberal government took the irresponsible step of shutting down the RCMP depot in Regina. \lineBreak We are examining all government spending across the board, particularly in headquarters staff, to ensure taxpayers get the best value for their dollars, and the RCMP is no different in that respect."
1872,"Mr. Speaker, the lines prepared for the minister do not conceal the reality. The government's plan includes cuts to the RCMP. This has been confirmed by the Auditor General. The government's aggressive approach has already forced the RCMP to make cuts to investigations into organized crime, drug traffickers and white-collar criminals. The government's plan for the RCMP does not make sense. \lineBreak Why sacrifice the quality of police services in Canada? Why ask the RCMP to do more with less?","Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could repeat again that it was our government that hired 1,800 new front-line RCMP officers. We provided $400 million to provinces in terms of their responsibilities to hire and recruit officers; as I pointed out, it was the former Liberal government that shut down the RCMP training depot. \lineBreak When we came into office, we went from 300 officers a year in terms of training to 1,800 a year. We are committed to front-line policing."
1873,"Mr. Speaker, Conservatives' lack of transparency on spending reached a new low this week. When the media asked how much the Department of National Defence's HQ renovation would cost, the government responded by saying, “Go file an access to information request”. \lineBreak Now we find out that this paranoid government had the number of $623 million all along but would not release it to the public, so I ask the minister this question: what could possibly be the justification for keeping this number secret?","Mr. Speaker, yes, in fact, the Department of National Defence and the public works department are collaborating to consolidate the workforce of national defence here in the nation's capital. We are moving forward with a plan to have those consolidated workforces go from 48 different buildings to 7 in the national capital. An independent third-party analysis has looked at this plan and has come back with the numbers. There will be a cost saving, a long-term ongoing savings, estimated at around $30 million a year. This is good news for taxpayers, and I know the member opposite will want to support it."
1874,"Mr. Speaker, we will deal with the issue of whether or not we are getting value for dollars afterwards, but right now I would like an answer to the question of why the government felt it was necessary to keep a number that it already had secret from the media, secret from the public and secret from this Parliament.  \lineBreak What is the justification for the secrecy?","Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his question, albeit in a rant. I will answer the question again. This is a good move for the Department of National Defence. It will see us consolidate our headquarters at the Nortel campus, which was purchased, I again repeat, to save money. This was done looking at the spending levels that were recorded.  \lineBreak Where were they recorded? It was at a Senate hearing some nine months ago.  \lineBreak Where were they recorded? I spoke about this in transcript at the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, of which the member opposite was a member."
1875,"Mr. Speaker, all of the available evidence, including evidence from the Department of Justice, shows that mandatory minimum sentences are excessive, ineffective, disproportionate, costly and do nothing but increase prison populations.  \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, this matter has been the subject of extensive debate, not only in the House, but also in committee. All documents indicating the costs involved have been tabled. As we know, victims are the ones who bear the cost of crime. We are talking about a total cost of $99.6 billion, 83% of which is borne by the victims. We support the victims, while they support the criminals."
1876,"Mr. Speaker, the justice for victims of terrorism act would give victims of terror a civil remedy against their terrorist perpetrators, but it would limit the remedy by immunizing the state perpetrator of terrorism, allowing the remedy to be used only against proxies or agents of the state sponsor.  \lineBreak Why is the government denying Canadians an effective remedy against states that support terrorist proxies or that commit the terrorist acts themselves?","Mr. Speaker, I know the member has been working on this file for a long time, and we appreciate the support that he has provided in giving us advice. \lineBreak We have proceeded in the way that we have in the bill because of the advice we received from various organizations. We believe that this is the most effective way to ensure that terrorists are held accountable and that victims have a remedy in situations where they would otherwise not have a remedy."
1877,"Mr. Speaker, 17 people died on March 12, 2009, when Cougar flight 491 went down after loss of oil pressure. Less than a year before, the same thing happened to an Australian helicopter, but Transport Canada failed to take action. \lineBreak After the Newfoundland tragedy, the Transportation Safety Board recommended that all Cougars must be able to run dry for 30 minutes, but the Sikorsky still fails the test. \lineBreak Why are we giving the Cougars a free pass at the risk of the lives of offshore workers?","Mr. Speaker, this was a very tragic accident. My thoughts are with the victims and their families. \lineBreak My department continues to work toward addressing the recommendations of the Transportation Safety Board. We will also continue working with our international partners to develop a coordinated approach that would help prevent these accidents from occurring in the future."
1878,"Mr. Speaker, families of the victims who died in a Cougar helicopter crash off Newfoundland want to know why the faulty Cougar gearbox was certified. \lineBreak  The minister will not answer. The sole survivor of the crash wants to make sure all helicopters in the air now can run dry for 30 minutes. The Transportation Safety Board agrees with that recommendation. \lineBreak Why does the minister continue to allow these faulty, unsafe helicopters in the air? Why is the minister ignoring the safety of Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, the safety of the public is very important to us. \lineBreak We do not use these events to play politics. This is a very tragic accident. Our condolences go out to the victims and their families. \lineBreak I can confirm that Transport Canada has received notification that the litigation against it relating to this accident has been discontinued."

That is exactly what we are going to do. \lineBreak However, today the members from  \lineBreak Could the ",I am afraid that question has nothing to do with the administration of government.

When there is an announcement to be made on an agreement to protect Canadian jobs and to promote economic growth, we will certainly make that.  \lineBreak Concerning Canadians travelling abroad, obviously whenever we travel to a foreign country, we have to bring a passport, and that is important for international security. I can assure the member opposite that we will work to protect Canadian sovereignty and to protect Canadian privacy. We will work to ensure that we do the best thing for the Canadian economy to help create more jobs, more hope and more opportunity."
1881,"Mr. Speaker, the government said it did not order public servants to replace the term “Government of Canada” with the  \lineBreak However, records show that is just not true. As one Industry Canada official noted in an email, he was forced to use the PM's name “as per our directive from PCO”.  \lineBreak This Soviet-style politicization of Canada's bureaucracy is unethical, and it breaks the government's own rules. Why force neutral public servants to do the ","Mr. Speaker, I have been called a lot of things, but never “Soviet-style”. This is a first for me. \lineBreak I want to assure the hon. member that in fact there is no need for a directive that she seems to believe in, because it has been a long-standing practice across various governments. In fact, when the Liberals were in government, they used the term “Chrétien government”, “Martin government” and similar variations in official government communications.  \lineBreak The proof is in the pudding. This terminology is widely used by journalists and by the opposition parties. If the circumstances permit, those are the circumstances in which we would use that term."
1882,"Mr. Speaker, the government says it is still committed to improving the Canada pension plan and the Quebec pension plan because that is the favourite option of Canadians. \lineBreak Unlike the government's pooled pension scheme, the CPP and QPP are inflation-proof, provide a guaranteed defined benefit, and cost less. \lineBreak Canadians are not that concerned with voting records; what they want to know is whether the ","Mr. Speaker, in talks on the Canada pension plan with our partners, the provinces, we continue to discuss any enhancements that may be appropriate at this time, but I would remind the hon. member that there was consensus, unanimous support, among the federal, provincial and territorial finance ministers to pursue the framework for a pooled registered pension plan. \lineBreak That is why we tabled it in this House. We continue discussions. We continue to develop the regulations around it to make an effective retirement plan for the 60% of Canadians in the workforce who do not have a pension plan right now."
1883,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are currently jeopardizing the delicate economic situation in the regions. Cuts to several post offices in Quebec are completely destroying postal services in rural areas. Postal services are essential to our communities and contribute to their economic development.  \lineBreak Will this government finally act responsibly and come up with ways to develop the services, instead of making them disappear?","Mr. Speaker, the volume of mail fluctuates from province to province and year to year. Canada Post makes decisions on the number of hours worked based on those fluctuations. People who have a permanent job with Canada Post will keep their job with Canada Post. There are no job reductions, as the member has stated. \lineBreak We are committed to ensuring that all Canadians get the postal service they deserve."
1884,"Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon.  \lineBreak The  \lineBreak I would ask the ","Mr. Speaker, one thing is for sure. We do need to have leadership in the economy , and that is what this government stands for. We balance the economy with environmental protection. That balance is achievable, and we have a plan to achieve that. \lineBreak That is why Canada has a very strong action plan that is focused on reducing our emissions by 17% of 2005 levels by 2020. That is real leadership."
1885,"Mr. Speaker, B.C. families did not want the Conservative-Liberal harmonized sales tax three years ago, but the Conservative government refused to listen. We rejected the unfair tax again in referendum last summer. The government wants to make B.C. families pay billions in penalties. The government continues to stall and refuses to implement the removal of the HST. \lineBreak Will the Conservatives finally take responsibility for their role and negotiate a fair deal for British Columbians? Why do they continue to ask B.C. families to pick up the tab for this absolute, utter, complete Conservative-Liberal HST fiasco?","Mr. Speaker, we actually respect provincial jurisdiction. Harmonization of the sales tax is provincial jurisdiction. British Columbia chose not to continue with that, but the B.C. government acknowledged the that harmonization agreement stipulated that transitional assistance must be recovered should the province wish to exit the program."
1886,"Mr. Speaker, the sound we are hearing is the Conservatives desperately trying to blame somebody. They have nobody to blame but themselves. \lineBreak The government has already collected two years of HST revenue from B.C. families. The unfair Conservative tax has already cost B.C. families hundreds upon hundreds of dollars a year. The Conservative government seems to want to make British Columbians pay and pay and pay. \lineBreak When will the government agree to give families a break and stop making them pay for the Conservative-Liberal HST fiasco? When will it fix the B.C. HST error? ","Mr. Speaker, the only HST error comes from the members of the NDP. They are uncertain whether they are for it or against it. For example, in British Columbia I understand now they are against it. In Quebec they are for the HST. In Nova Scotia they actually supported an increase in the HST.  \lineBreak Those members cannot have it both ways. Either they want to reduce taxes for Canadians and make taxes fairer or they do not. I am assuming they do not."
1887,"Mr. Speaker, once upon a time, there was a CBC reporter, now the  \lineBreak At the time, he said that future generations would have to worry about the threat posed by greenhouse gases and, well, here we are. \lineBreak What is the minister waiting for to come up with a real plan, instead of pulling Canada out of Kyoto?","Mr. Speaker, let me assure my colleague that Canada will participate in the Durban conference in the same good faith we have demonstrated at pre-COP meetings all through this year. \lineBreak Canada is working toward a new single international climate change agreement that would include all major emitters. The Cancun agreements, based on the Copenhagen accord, provide a solid foundation for such a regime. In Durban we will work to implement this agreement."
1888,"Mr. Speaker, I do not have a lot of faith in that good faith because it is Conservative inaction that has made us a climate change laggard and denied Canadians jobs in the new energy economy. \lineBreak I do not blame the Conservatives for wanting to pull out. Kyoto's independent emissions audits have exposed six years of failure by the government, six years of failed environmental policies and six years of failed federal leadership. \lineBreak The government's climate inaction kills Canadian jobs. When will it stop blaming the Liberals for the failure of Kyoto? When will it actually introduce a plan for a transition to a new energy economy?","Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for reminding the House that the Kyoto agreement was one of the biggest blunders the previous Liberal government made.  \lineBreak Canada will not take on a new target under the Kyoto protocol, but we will not obstruct those who wish to cling to it. The protocol is neither effective nor fair, and it  does not include commitments by all major emitters. \lineBreak  We do remain committed to the Copenhagen accord, which the "
1889,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the government admitted that its prison agenda bill was flawed. The  \lineBreak Now that the government has admitted its bill is flawed, will it finally work with others to make improvements, or will it continue to insist on ramming the bill through Parliament?","Mr. Speaker, we will make no such admission. The bill is very targeted. It goes after drug dealers and child molesters. \lineBreak We consulted with the people of Canada. Millions of Canadians heard what we had to say. They gave us their support, and we are very grateful for that."
1890,"Mr. Speaker, talking to the Conservatives about Bill  \lineBreak Yesterday in the House, the government finally admitted that its crime bill, Bill C-10, is seriously flawed. Experts agree. Police chiefs agree. The provinces agree. This bill is bad and unbalanced and will cost the provinces a fortune. After months of ignoring everyone, the government finally seems to understand that it made a mistake.  \lineBreak Will the government send the bill back to committee so we can make the necessary changes, or will it continue down the wrong path, to the detriment of the provinces and Canadian families?","Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of Canadians and Quebeckers—except for those across the floor—understand the important objective of Bill  \lineBreak Furthermore, an eminent Quebecker, former minister Marc Bellemare, recently said, “Minister Fournier did not speak for all Quebeckers in Ottawa. I think this bill is in line with Quebec's values.” \lineBreak It is time for the opposition to stop deceiving Canadians and Quebeckers."
1891,"Mr. Speaker, service at EI call centres is the worst it has been in six years and yet the minister still will not admit she has a problem. She has the gall to blame staff for service slowdowns. That is outrageous. That minister cut 1,000 processing agent jobs. That is why call centres cannot keep up and jobless Canadians cannot reach anyone when they need help. \lineBreak When will the minister stop her work to rule, admit she has a problem and fix Service Canada call centres?","Mr. Speaker, we do want to ensure that Canadians get access to the benefits they need and deserve in a timely manner. That is why we are investing in upgrades to the systems, whether it is our EI processing, which is woefully paper-based and takes way too long to process, or whether it is our call centres. \lineBreak I would point out that the member opposite's numbers are a bit wrong. In fact, most calls for assistance are handled and answered through the automated system."
1892,"Mr. Speaker, this government is desperately trying to justify its bad decisions. A thousand Service Canada agents who process employment insurance claims have been laid off since the spring. Frustrated unemployed workers have to wait weeks before they are able speak to a representative. The minister is now accusing employees of purposely slowing down the work. \lineBreak Will this government finally recognize that its cuts at Service Canada are responsible for the distress of unemployed workers' families?","Mr. Speaker, under our economic action plan to deal with the global recession, we did engage quite a number of additional personnel on a short-term basis. The employees knew that. The unions knew that. It was to help get over the spike in EI claims. \lineBreak Our unemployment rate is down. We no longer need all of those people to process. They were released. Many of them though were actually absorbed into the system to work and to continue to improve services so Canadians get the benefits they need in a timely manner."
1893,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the  \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives making partisan appointments to an independent tribunal? Why did that minister mislead the House?","I did no such thing, Mr. Speaker. I said that I was aware of two  individuals that I had appointed out of 150 appointments and reappointments. Every one of those individuals made it through the very rigorous pre-screening process, where 90% of candidates are not actually recommended to the minister. \lineBreak Just last week the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees told me that he thought Canada continued to have  the world's model asylum system. It is unfortunate that the NDP is denigrating the independence and the integrity of this important quasi-judicial body, which is regarded as a model throughout the world and which now has the most rigorous pre-screening process for appointments in its history."
1894,"Mr. Speaker, the so-called build Canada infrastructure fund will run out in 2014, but the government cannot be trusted to give municipalities what they need: accountable, comprehensive and transparent funding. It does not even know how many jobs were created from the economic action plan. \lineBreak To ensure transparency and accountability this time, will the minister commit to tabling progress reports on each phase of his consultations?","Mr. Speaker, I was very proud this morning, on behalf of the  \lineBreak I have here a press release from the Fédération canadienne des municipalités, Connect Canada, Engineers Canada, and Union des municipalités du Québec, all supporting the great job we are doing with infrastructure."
1895,"Mr. Speaker, two out of three infrastructure applications from first nations communities have been rejected since 2006. That is close to 1,000 applications from aboriginal communities for roads, sewage treatment and clean water. The first nations were just told no. The result is desperate situations. These important applications should not be dismissed. They should be reviewed and approved. \lineBreak Why does the infrastructure minister continue to tolerate third world conditions in first nations communities?","Mr. Speaker, we have spent unprecedented money on infrastructure on reserves. It does not all come out of the stimulus spending plan. A lot of it is departmental spending. We have spent it on water and waste water systems. We have spent it on housing. We have spent it through Health Canada on health clinics.  \lineBreak This is an unprecedented level of investment in first nations by any other government. This is a big accomplishment, and we want to continue to build from that. "
1896,"Mr. Speaker, our communities are facing major challenges. Although the government made the excise tax permanent, it is still insufficient to address our communities' infrastructure priorities. The government's excise tax brings in 10¢ a litre, but municipalities receive only 5¢ a litre. \lineBreak Will the government commit to indexing the amount given to the municipalities and thus assure Canadians that the money paid will indeed be invested in our communities? ","Mr. Speaker, this morning I had the honour of presenting, on behalf of our great  \lineBreak This morning, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities praised the work of this government saying that no government, has done as much for this country's infrastructure as our government has in the past few years: we have invested $33 billion in the building Canada fund, something that has never been seen in the history of this country."
1897,"Mr. Speaker, while we wait for 2014, this government is once again turning its back on families and refusing to respond to calls for financing for the new Guertin amphitheatre in Gatineau and the new coliseum in Trois-Rivières. This infrastructure is an important economic driver for these regions and allows families to be more active and to attend sporting and cultural events. \lineBreak Why is this government refusing to make any sort of contribution? Does this government want to kill these regions' economies at any price?","Mr. Speaker, we have said it before and we have repeated it in the past few days. I issued a statement on November 10 and I sent a letter to the Government of Quebec dated November 21 to the effect that our government will not support sports infrastructure that will be used for professional sports and major junior league teams. We have been very clear. We have said it repeatedly. This applies to the entire country—not just one region but the entire country. We will continue in that direction."
1898,"Mr. Speaker, today Statistics Canada reported that Canada's economy grew 3.5% in the third quarter. This growth is beyond the expectations of private sector economists. It is a positive sign in troubled times, yet we know that as a result of this period of economic uncertainty, there are many Canadian families that are struggling to make ends meet. \lineBreak Would the ","Mr. Speaker, today's numbers showing significant growth in the Canadian economy last quarter are very encouraging. At the same time, we remain very concerned about the problems in Europe, particularly the problems of debt and deficit. \lineBreak These problems are part and parcel of the fragile global economy. That is why we will continue to focus on our plan to keep taxes low in order to foster employment and growth. \lineBreak We will continue to be focused, as a government, on jobs and growth, and also on keeping taxes low. Now is not the time for the kind of job-killing tax hikes proposed by the NDP."
1899,"Mr. Speaker, Henk Tepper's family in New Brunswick is still waiting for him to come home safe and sound. \lineBreak Today we learned the RCMP sent his private information to Algeria before he was arrested. This sounds like the Maher Arar scandal all over again. \lineBreak Will the Conservative government take responsibility for its role in this affair and will it tell this House, and the Tepper family, what it is doing to bring Henk Tepper home today?","Mr. Speaker, I am advised that the RCMP has assisted Interpol with a criminal investigation. I am also advised that the RCMP co-operation was done in accordance with Canadian law. It would be inappropriate to comment any further as this matter is ongoing."
1900,"Mr. Speaker, it is not good enough to say that the minister cannot speak publicly. What we have learned today is too serious. This is not the first time that personal information about Canadian citizens has been sent to foreign governments, and often in very problematic situations. The RCMP did not even advise Mr. Tepper that it was providing his personal information to a foreign country. \lineBreak What does this government intend to do to address this situation and return Mr. Tepper to Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I am advised that the RCMP has assisted Interpol with a criminal investigation. I am also advised that the RCMP co-operation was done in accordance with Canadian law. It would be inappropriate to comment any further as this investigation is ongoing."
1901,"Mr. Speaker, the fate of Canadians detained abroad is not the only problem. After spending months turning in circles without making any announcements, the government is now prepared to sign the border agreement with the United States. No one knows what is in that agreement. The Privacy Commissioner is concerned about the way the information will be shared with the Americans, but the government refuses to talk to her. \lineBreak I have a very simple question: will the government commit to presenting the agreement to Parliament?","Mr. Speaker, no final agreement has been reached. Ongoing discussions are taking place. When there is an agreement to be announced, members opposite will certainly be among the first to hear that. \lineBreak We are seeking to establish a relationship with the Obama administration to ensure that the border is not a barrier to jobs, economic growth, or growing the Canadian economy. There is a reason why the Canadian economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter. It is because this government is focused like a laser on jobs and the economy, and we are going to continue to do so."
1902,"Mr. Speaker, how can anyone trust the government? Every time it negotiates with the Americans, it costs Canadian jobs, and Canadian families lose out. That is the record. From the softwood lumber sellout to thickening the border to new fees slapped on Canadians to the government's botched efforts on buy American, Conservatives have failed to defend the interests of Canadians every single time. \lineBreak When will the minister bring an agreement before Parliament? Will the Conservatives let Canadians see what they are giving away this time?","Mr. Speaker, we are working with the Obama administration to try to allow trade to go back and forth between Canada and the United States. This is not just important, but it is vital to the auto sector in southwestern Ontario and critical to the future economy of Windsor-Essex. \lineBreak The member opposite disagrees with free trade. He does not want us to trade with the United States. He does not want a trade agreement with the United States. If he will not fight for jobs in Windsor-Essex, maybe he should step aside and let those of us on this side of the House do it."
1903,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservative government has used privacy as a reason for getting rid of the long form census. It used privacy as an excuse for killing the long gun registry. Despite its apparent concern about privacy, we now learn that the government is willing to sign a perimeter security deal with the U.S., sharing the travelling information of Canadians. \lineBreak Why do the Americans have the right to know where Canadians are travelling if they are not going to or over American territory?","Mr. Speaker, no agreement has been concluded. No agreement has been announced, yet the member opposite is scaremongering Canadians. \lineBreak We are seeking a constructive relationship with the Obama administration to ensure that goods and services can make their way across the border. That is good for Canadian jobs, good for American jobs, and good for economic growth. That is the focus that this government is taking: job protection and job creation here in Canada."
1904,"Mr. Speaker, in the name of privacy, this government refuses to give the provinces the information from the firearms registry—which would improve protection for the public and our police officers—but it is prepared to give the Americans some very personal information, such as the fact that Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so left Labelle and went to Paris. \lineBreak Why does the Conservative government trust the American authorities more than the provincial governments, its Canadian partners?","Mr. Speaker, every time Canadians travel to the United States they produce their passport and  they have to tell the authorities who they are and where they are going. The reality is that we want it to be as easy as possible for Canadian firms to do business in the United States, to build and manufacture goods and services right here in Canada, and to sell them south of the border. \lineBreak A thickening border is preventing that, and this government, under the leadership of this "
1905,"Mr. Speaker, this summer, when the Conservatives decided to profess their love for the royals by hanging portraits of the Queen all over the place and adding the word “royal” to the name of our air force, they completely forgot to think about an appropriate French acronym. In a rush, they decided to use the name “forces aériennes royales canadiennes”, or FARC. You do not need to know much about geopolitics to know that FARC is a Colombian terrorist organization. \lineBreak Who will the ","Mr. Speaker, it is clear. Our air force's French name is Aviation royale du Canada, and we are very proud of that name. \lineBreak I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Lieutenant-General Charlie Bouchard and our entire Royal Canadian Air Force for all they did to bring about the successful liberation of the people of Libya. \lineBreak Congratulations and thank you."
1906,"Mr. Speaker, the name change was improvised. The French acronym was created on the fly. This mistake highlights the lack of consideration for the French language. The Conservatives are improvising all over the place: the management of military bases, the purchase of equipment, our veterans. That is a worrying trend. \lineBreak How does the minister explain to francophone air force personnel and their families, who are proud of the work they do, that his department's original plan was to rename the air force with the acronym of a terrorist organization?","Mr. Speaker, restoring the historic royal designation of the three branches re-establishes an important and recognizable part of our military heritage and establishes a link with similar important contributions made by the Canadian Forces today. We are very proud of this name and we are certainly very proud of the people who work very hard for our country every day."
1907,"Mr. Speaker, in July of this year our Canadian Forces handed over Task Force Kandahar to American personnel, and we began drawing down on equipment and personnel. \lineBreak The Canadian focus for the next few years will be our training mission centred in and around Kabul. Today we learned that Task Force Canuck, our tactical air lift unit, will be welcomed home at 8 Wing Trenton. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, the member for  \lineBreak Today the Chief of the Defence Staff and other senior military commanders will welcome home the crew of Task Force Canuck, our outstanding Hercules aircraft unit that conducted operations in Afghanistan. \lineBreak They began their engagement in Afghanistan in 2001, transporting Canadian Forces personnel and equipment in and out of the Kandahar airfield, as well as supporting the ISAF mission brilliantly. They completed more than 3,400 logistical and operational missions successfully and safely over that 10-year period. \lineBreak We welcome them home. We thank them. We congratulate them. They are the best."
1908,"Mr. Speaker, on November 7 Air Canada decided to move its head office to Brampton, Ontario. This move will force over 140 employees to choose between moving their families and losing their jobs. There is a good chance most of them will choose to remain in Montreal, which could make it very difficult for Air Canada employees to obtain services in French. \lineBreak Will the minister enforce the law stipulating that Air Canada's head office must be located in Montreal, and will he protect bilingualism within Air Canada?","Mr. Speaker, in response to my hon. colleague, I would remind her that we recently introduced a bill on respect for official languages that allows the Commissioner of Official Languages to deal directly with companies that are under contract with Air Canada. There is also an amendment to compel the company to honour its commitments. Air Canada is a private corporation and we want it to be as successful as possible here in Canada."
1909,"Mr. Speaker, as I was saying yesterday, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to end the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry once and for all. That is exactly what we are going to do.  \lineBreak The NDP has punished its members for voting with their constituents. It has sent members into committee to try to gut our legislation and is now engaging in misleading propaganda, claiming that restricted firearms would become non-restricted after the registry is abolished. \lineBreak Could the minister comment on whether ending the long gun registry will do this?","Mr. Speaker, first the NDP showed a restricted firearm on its misleading ads and claimed it was non-restricted. When this deceit was uncovered, it was forced to change its ads. What were they replaced with? Yet another restricted firearm that the NDP claims to be non-restricted. \lineBreak I would call on the NDP to end this ridiculous and misleading campaign. Repeatedly playing fast and loose with the facts just shows Canadians that the NDP is unfit to govern."
1910,"Mr. Speaker, with the planned cuts to Canada Post, we are starting to wonder whether people have to live downtown to be entitled to postal service. Does the government forget that mail delivery is an essential service? Canadians and Quebeckers who live in rural areas need and are entitled to receive their mail and have a post office nearby. Driving or walking 20, 30 or 40 minutes to get the mail is unacceptable. \lineBreak Why is the government refusing to keep rural post offices open?","Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to quality postal service for all Canadians, no matter where they live. That is why our government introduced the Canadian Postal Service Charter. We expect Canada Post to abide by the charter and provide quality postal service that Canadians can count on. \lineBreak We are focused on service to Canadians like a laser. That member is zapped. "
1911,"Mr. Speaker, again, the Conservative government is embarrassing us at the climate change conference in Durban by collecting fossil awards and taking jabs here and there for its inaction on reducing greenhouse gases. The Premier of Quebec, his environment minister, and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu all denounce Canada's attitude. \lineBreak Can the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is proud of the abundance of natural resources with which our country has been blessed. We are also proud of the responsible and sustainable way that these resources are being developed. Finally, we are proud of our commitment to the Copenhagen and Cancun agreements and our pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17% by 2020."
1912,"Mr. Speaker, eight months ago, Hank Tepper went to Lebanon with a Canadian trade delegation to sell potatoes. He has been held in a tiny Beirut jail cell ever since. Eight months in a Beirut jail for dubious allegations about potatoes sent to Algeria four years ago makes no sense at all. \lineBreak The minister should understand that a consular visit for 10 minutes, once a month, by a junior officer at our embassy, is not going to solve the problem. When will she take her responsibility and bring this Canadian citizen home to New Brunswick for Christmas?","Mr. Speaker, the House knows that the government is very concerned about Mr. Tepper's case and knows how difficult this is for him and his family. I have said this before: consular officials in Lebanon have been actively providing consular assistance and support to Mr. Tepper and his family since his arrival. \lineBreak As I have also mentioned, we are engaging on Mr. Tepper's behalf through quiet and diplomatic channels because we strongly believe that this is the best possible approach, and we will continue to work in Mr. Tepper's best interests."
1913,"Mr. Speaker, prejudicial legal manoeuvring continues in the political persecution against former Ukrainian prime minister Tymoshenko. Now the judge, who was to hear her appeal tomorrow, has just been fired, and her health in jail continues to deteriorate.  \lineBreak Other governments are wading in. What is Canada doing? Is Canada insisting on all legal proceedings being public? Has independent medical help been provided, and has Ukraine been warned that anything untoward happening to Ms. Tymoshenko will damage relations with Canada?","Mr. Speaker, this government has spoken out strongly against politically-based judicial proceedings. We are tremendously concerned by what we have seen in Ukraine. We have been very clear with the Government of Ukraine that Canada, Canadians, and the Government of Canada expect that this individual will be treated fairly with an independent judicial process, and that there would be consequences to our bilateral relations if this does not happen. \lineBreak We remain very concerned about her health and are certainly prepared to offer her anything we can to support her in that regard."
1914,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the government actively responded to the community's needs right away, and not just now. Over the past five years, the government has invested over $90 million in this community. However, clearly, a significant part of our responsibility involves ensuring that the people in these communities are receiving the full benefit of this funding. "
1915,"Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to see that the  \lineBreak People are living in tents, shacks and trailers. Young people have been without a school for 10 years. \lineBreak On October 28, the council declared a state of emergency. The  \lineBreak How does the ","Mr. Speaker, once again, the department responded right away to the urgent needs. However, the community has many needs. More services are needed. The government has already invested a lot of money. There is a need for better management of public funds, and the government is going to take responsibility for ensuring that those needs are met."
1916,"Mr. Speaker, federal officials travelled to Attawapiskat at least 10 times this year. No red flags were raised. Why? We need an answer.  \lineBreak Does the ","Mr. Speaker, unlike the NDP, which has voted against investments in this community and elsewhere, this government has made tens of millions of dollars of investments in this community, infrastructure investments of over $50,000 for every man, woman and child. It is obvious there continue to be needs. \lineBreak The government is working to fulfill those needs, but they are twofold. There is a need, obviously, for more services and infrastructure. There is also clearly a need for better management. The government will ensure both of those things are dealt with."
1917,"Mr. Speaker, all across northern Canada are these isolated little Bantu-style homelands where people live on top of each other in mouldy shacks and where dying in slow motion is a way of life. The  \lineBreak So now that he has deposed the elected council and blamed the community for years of chronic underfunding, where is his long-term plan to get this community out of this disgraceful level of poverty?","Mr. Speaker, the Mushkegowuk Tribal Council invoked a declaration of emergency on October 28.  \lineBreak On November 7 we got our first funding proposal from Attawapiskat First Nation.  \lineBreak On November 8 we approved $500,000 immediately to be used for some housing renovations. We responded quickly.  \lineBreak On Thursday, November 24, we got an emergency declaration from Attawapiskat and on Monday, November 28, my officials were in the community. That is why we appointed a third party manager."
1918,"Mr. Speaker, if he were a leader, he would be there. \lineBreak  I will tell him what the situation is on the ground. Beyond the tents, the unheated cabins, and the mouldy condemned homes, there are still 90 people living in a trailer that has no sprinkler water suppression and very few washrooms. Now that he has personally taken command of this community, what plan does he have to get those people into long-term housing? Does he have a plan or is this a desire to punish an impoverished little community for making him look bad?","Mr. Speaker, our priority is to address the urgent health and safety needs of the people of Attawapiskat. We informed the chief that the community will be placed in third party management to ensure that community needs are addressed. \lineBreak We are working with the community and with the province of Ontario, through Emergency Management Ontario, to quickly implement the community's existing emergency management plan to ensure that residents have access to warm, dry and safe shelter."
1919,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday in committee I asked the  \lineBreak When did the ","Mr. Speaker, I just pointed out that on October 28, the Mushkegowuk Tribal Council invoked a state of emergency for three communities. \lineBreak Nine or ten days later we received a request from Attawapiskat and we responded. \lineBreak On November 24, last Thursday, we received an emergency measure from Attawapiskat."
1920,"Mr. Speaker, the minister really does not know what he is talking about. This is not an isolated incident. First nations communities across this country are in crisis. There are hundreds of communities without clean running water and safe housing. \lineBreak The buck stops with the ","Mr. Speaker, we understand that there are many challenges in first nations communities. We have spent in an unprecedented fashion on improving the lives of first nations across the country. We have spent more than any other government on basic infrastructure and housing. We have involved ourselves in improving child welfare and the education file, and we will continue to do those things."
1921,"Mr. Speaker, instead of making progress and creating jobs by supporting clean energy industries, as everyone else in the world is doing, Canada is lagging behind. The only plan this government has is to go to the climate change conference in Durban and sabotage the discussions. Our partners are already shutting us out because of this out-of-touch government's policies. \lineBreak What is the government waiting for to come up with a policy centred on the green economy?","Mr. Speaker, the hon. member finally understands that her party is vulnerable because it is fighting a major job creating project.  \lineBreak She is now claiming, incredibly, that blocking Keystone would be good for Canadian jobs. That is like saying blocking the export of grain would be good for Canadian jobs because there is employment in baking bread. \lineBreak  In fact, the oil sands will generate 500,000 jobs, including union jobs, and trillions of dollars of economic activity. Is there not at least one leadership contender who will take the side of Canadian workers?"
1922,"Mr. Speaker, someone needs to press reset. That was not exactly a winning answer,  \lineBreak I will give the  \lineBreak Even China is now saying that Canada pulling out of Kyoto will mess up the negotiations. Conservative inaction is—","Order, please. The hon. member for Halifax has the floor."
1923,"Mr. Speaker, Conservative inaction is killing Canadian jobs. \lineBreak When will the government finally commit to working on a plan with the world community on a plan for the new energy economy of the future?","Mr. Speaker, Canada is indeed working toward a single new international climate change regime that will include all major emitters, including China. \lineBreak The Cancun agreements, based on the Copenhagen accords, provide a solid foundation for such a regime, and in Durban our Canadian delegation will work to implement these agreements."
1924,"Mr. Speaker, it would have taken the  \lineBreak When will the minister confirm that he fabricated the whole story about participating in a military exercise in order to get out of this mess?","Mr. Speaker, I will ignore the hyperbole and the hyperventilating. I have said before that I was leaving personal time to go back to work early and before doing so, took part in a search and rescue exercise that we had been trying to arrange for some time."
1925,"Mr. Speaker, on September 26, the ","Mr. Speaker, as I just said, and as I have said before in the House a number of times, I took part in a search and rescue demonstration. That in fact happened. It has been confirmed by Brigadier-General Bédard who stated:"
1926,"Mr. Speaker, the government continues to show gross and unrelenting incompetence when it comes to providing our forces with the equipment they need. \lineBreak  In 2006 the government started the process of replacing rusting transport trucks. Yesterday we started all over again, six years behind schedule. Seven years ago the federal government announced the contract to purchase 28 maritime helicopters. The first of these was due over three years ago. We have yet to receive it. \lineBreak When will we see some accountability in the government's military procurement program?","Mr. Speaker, if I may with respect to the member, he ought not to be reading his own headlines.

We are only about halfway through the list, so I will ask all hon. colleagues for a bit of co-operation. \lineBreak The hon. member for Mount Royal."
1929,"Mr. Speaker, over a month ago, following the tragic death of Jamie Hubley, I asked the Conservatives to tell us their plan on youth bullying. The Minister of Foreign Affairs replied, “Bullying and intimidation have no place in our schools. Our society needs to engage in promoting tolerance and acceptance”. \lineBreak The tragic suicide this week of Marjorie Raymond, a bullied teenage girl in Gaspésie, proves once again that we must act now. \lineBreak Ontario is acting. Quebec is acting. What will the federal government do to protect our children from bullying and how long do we have to wait for this?","Mr. Speaker, our hearts go out to the family and friends of Marjorie Raymond, as well as anyone who has been victimized by bullying. Bullying is completely unacceptable and it should never be tolerated. We do support the measures that provinces take.  \lineBreak I encourage anyone who is a victim of bullying to reach out to an adult and know that he or she is not alone. Call Kids Help, do something, there are people there to help. We support them as I think all of us in the House do."
1930,"Mr. Speaker, that answer tells me that the Conservative government does not believe that the federal government can play a role in this area. I believe it can.  \lineBreak The NDP introduced a bill to establish a national suicide prevention strategy. It is part of the solution that made the headlines one day and was written off by the Conservatives the next. We have to put in place a coordinated plan to fight bullying. Ontario and Quebec are taking action; now it is Ottawa's turn to do so. \lineBreak I will be introducing a bill in the near future to directly attack this serious societal problem. I am asking the Conservatives to set aside partisanship and work with the NDP to effectively fight bullying and its devastating effects on our children.","Mr. Speaker, we all have a role to play in combatting bullying. I am very proud of the work our government has done in funding some specific projects. For example, in Ontario we help fund My Webworld: Truth for Rural Youth, which deals specifically with bullying.  \lineBreak We all need to work together and lead by example, even the House, as individuals, MPs and parents, that we do not tolerate bullying on any level at all."
1931,"Mr. Speaker, this week's brazen attacks on the British Embassy in Tehran were extremely disturbing. Iranian authorities failed to uphold their responsibilities under the Vienna Convention, which specifically safeguard diplomatic missions. Following this outrageous act, the British have pulled their ambassador to Iran. \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for all members of the House that the safety and security of our diplomatic staff in Tehran is a top concern when we hear about the outrageous attack on the British High Commission. We are in very close contact with the embassy in Tehran. We have had a limited engagement strategy for the last four years and we are following the situation very closely. \lineBreak I have asked my deputy minister to conduct a complete security review and we will do what is best for the Canadian officials who are doing the important work of Canada. We will ensure their safety if that requires evacuating them earlier."
1932,"Mr. Speaker, the government has replaced 1,000 real people at Service Canada with voicemail and it calls that progress. Any Canadian who has ever been stuck on hold knows that is just not true. As phone lines jam and service levels drop, the minister has no plan except to blame the remaining front-line workers.  \lineBreak The solution is clear. Instead of blaming staff, will the minister just commit to getting Service Canada job postings out the door today?","Mr. Speaker, our government's top priority is job creation and economic growth. We are committed to providing timely service to all Canadians who access the system. Service Canada is modernizing its EI processing systems to ensure that Canadians receive the best possible service."
1933,"Mr. Speaker, first the human resources minister blames front-line workers for the problems at Service Canada and now the  \lineBreak Why is the government blaming hard-working Canadians when Conservative mismanagement is really the problem?","Mr. Speaker, I said no such thing. I wrote to the president of the union, who I had asked several months ago to join us in a collective effort to find savings on programs that had outlived their usefulness or that could be delivered better to Canadians. He, instead, decided to go on full rhetorical mode.  \lineBreak We on this side of the House are focused on the issues that Canadians care about: jobs, economic opportunity, economic growth and making sure governments spend within their means. It is clear that union bosses do not have the same agenda and they are joined at the hip with the NDP."
1934,"Mr. Speaker, this government's logic makes me weep. \lineBreak It cuts 1,000 positions at Service Canada and then blames the few employees who remain for the delays in service. That is what it is doing. \lineBreak Canadians are paying the price in unreasonable delays in processing employment insurance claims. \lineBreak Will this government finally realize that it is the problem and stop blaming others for its inaction?","Mr. Speaker, we are committed to providing Canadians with the best possible service. Service Canada is modernizing its EI processing systems to ensure that Canadians have the best possible service. \lineBreak While this Conservative government continues on its strong direction, reducing taxes and creating jobs for Canadians, we urge the opposition to stop obstructing this great plan to create efficiencies and provide better services for Canadians."
1935," Mr. Speaker, as if that were not enough, this week, the  \lineBreak Is that this government's tactic? Is that how it goes about finding solutions to return to balanced budgets: blame everyone else and try to shirk responsibility?  \lineBreak Instead of attacking public servants, will this government take action to help the Canadians who have to deal with unacceptable delays at Service Canada?","Mr. Speaker, I already said that we are trying to work with the unions to ensure there is an action plan that works, but the union leaders are saying no. They are saying no to Canadians. They are saying no to the fact that it is important to have more jobs in our society. They are saying no to the decisions that work for Canadians. We have said yes."
1936,"Mr. Speaker, according to section 26 of the Financial Administration Act: \lineBreak We have now learned that the government transferred over $100 million from the green infrastructure fund to other departments, without even bothering to inform Parliament. \lineBreak Why are the Conservatives breaking the law?","Mr. Speaker, the transfer of the $170 million was clearly indicated, as stated in Industry Canada's 2011-12 Report on Plans and Priorities.  \lineBreak This money was transferred to achieve important government priorities. The government and the Treasury Board gave all the necessary approvals."
1937,"There was no approval by Parliament, Mr. Speaker. That is the point. \lineBreak The law states that “no payments shall be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund without the authority of Parliament”. We know the government transferred $50 million from the border infrastructure fund to spend money on gazebos in Muskoka without Parliament's approval. Now we have learned it transferred more than $100 million from the green infrastructure fund to other government departments without parliamentary approval. \lineBreak Why does the government continue to think that it is above the law?","Mr. Speaker, all Treasury Board approvals for the transfers were obtained. The transfers were referenced in various parliamentary reports beginning last fall. In particular, they were detailed in the 2011-12 reports on plans and priorities and again in 2010-11 departmental performance reports. This is nothing new."
1938,"Mr. Speaker, Canadian seniors built this country, but the government is letting too many older Canadians live in poverty. An HRSDC study found that, despite being eligible, more than 125,000 seniors are not receiving the old age security benefits they deserve. The government has known this since 2009. It has known about the problems in the program.  \lineBreak Why has the government not acted to ensure that all Canadian seniors receive the benefits to which they are entitled?","Mr. Speaker, our government has made great progress in providing for seniors. We have increased the GIS and appointed a minister to ensure that we have enhanced opportunities for seniors. We have expanded the new horizons fund to encourage seniors to mentor students and their family members to get involved in their communities. \lineBreak This government understands what seniors have done to build our country. We will continue to support them."

Since 2006, our government has provided billions in annual tax relief for seniors and pensioners, removed hundreds of thousands of seniors from the tax roll completely, introduced the largest GIS increase in a quarter century, and made significant investment in affordable housing for low-income seniors. \lineBreak What did the opposition do? It voted against all of these measures."
1940,"Mr. Speaker, while Canadians are being asked to accept cuts, the government is setting a very bad example. It spends $3 billion more in outside contractors than under the Liberals. It sends military helicopters to pick up a minister at a fishing camp. It has the most expensive cabinet in the history of this country, not to mention an unbelievably bloated Prime Minister's Office that never stops growing. \lineBreak How can the ","Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, we have a plan that has been sanctified by the people of Canada to make sure that our government spends within its means, that we eliminate unnecessary spending, and focus on the issues and services that Canadians need.

It is unfortunate that the hon. member and his party are not."
1941,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. Part of that means ensuring that a strong and effective RCMP continues to provide policing services in communities from coast to coast to coast.

As of today, over 1,000 families in my riding and neighbouring ridings are victims of the disaster known as pyrrhotite. \lineBreak Imagine a huge earthquake: except for the time factor, this is the extent of the harm caused by pyrrhotite. The problem is the result of the federal standard—or lack thereof—for the aggregates used in concrete. For years, people have been calling for the review of this standard and for adequate financial support to put an end to this problem. \lineBreak Will this government finally listen to the people of Canada or will it turn its back on them?","Mr. Speaker, issues of standards are regularly revisited by our government to ensure they recognize the most up-to-date science. We will be pleased to continue to look into that matter."
1944,"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about crime. They gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. \lineBreak Our Conservative government is committed to ensuring that serious offenders receive sentences which reflect the serious nature of their crimes.

No longer will Canada be a country that gives automatic discounts for multiple murderers. We believe in standing up for victims. This government is on the right track."
1945,"Mr. Speaker, day in, day out, the Conservatives refuse to recognize the importance of rural post offices. Cuts to Canada Post and the closure of postal outlets will deprive these communities of essential services and an important economic development tool. The Conservatives' campaign slogan was “our region in power”. If they want to give power to the regions, we have to work together. We know where the regions are, but we are still looking for the power.  \lineBreak Will the government commit to maintaining services everywhere, in all the regions?","Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to universally effective and economically viable postal services for all Canadians. That is why we introduced the Canadian Postal Service Charter and we are protecting rural mail delivery by banning closure of rural post offices. All Canadians deserve reliable postal service and that is what they are going to get."
1946,"Mr. Speaker, during committee deliberations on Bill  \lineBreak Now that we agree that these amendments are warranted and that they should never have been rejected in the first place, what will the government now do to see that these desirable amendments are in fact implemented?","Mr. Speaker, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to keep our streets and communities safe. That is why we have made passage of the safe streets and communities act a priority. \lineBreak We are always interested in measures that put victims first."
1947,"Mr. Speaker, the Governor General is upholding tradition. Like others before him, he does not seem to have a problem spending taxpayers' money for personal reasons.

1948,"Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order arising out of your ruling that my question did not relate to a matter of responsibility of the government. \lineBreak I want to point that I was asking about Elections Canada, which, of course, reports through a minister of the Crown. There have, in the past, certainly been questions in this House about the in-and-out scheme, for example, which is under Elections Canada, that were not ruled out of order. \lineBreak It seems to me that this is a matter that ought to be answered in this House.

1950,"Mr. Speaker, the unemployment rate is on the rise again. For the second month in a row on the Conservatives' watch, Canada has lost jobs. Some 19,000 jobs were lost in November. \lineBreak Will the government finally accept the fact that its inaction plan is not working?","Mr. Speaker, while we saw full-time job gains in November, we are of course disappointed that the overall job figures show, because of part-time job losses, a drop in employment of some 19,000. We do sympathize with all Canadians who have lost their jobs.  \lineBreak That said, after we emerged from the recession, we have still seen significant increases in jobs in Canada since the economic downturn took hold. That is in very stark contrast to most of our companion developed economies. That is actually evidence that our economic action plan is working."

It is unsustainable, yet the Conservatives stubbornly want to give even more money to non-performing corporations.  \lineBreak There are 1.4 million people unemployed in Canada, and 19,000 jobs were lost in November. When will the Conservatives stop applauding the loss of jobs?","Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we are working to implement our low-tax plan for jobs and growth, which is aimed at delivering jobs and opportunities for Canadians. \lineBreak We recently had votes in this House on the next phase of that economic action plan, seeking to deliver things like a job creation tax credit. That member voted against that job creation tax credit. He is the one who does not care about creating jobs. \lineBreak We took action by extending the accelerated capital cost allowance that allows Canadian companies to invest in equipment to make them more competitive, to allow them to continue to function, to create jobs, to do better on the world stage, to be able to export more. Again, the NDP voted against that effort to make our workers more competitive.  \lineBreak We are the ones focused on creating jobs. That is why Canada is healthy."
1952,"Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to see that the Conservatives' economic inaction plan is hurting Quebec the most. In Quebec, 31,000 jobs have been lost, half of which were full time. \lineBreak Are the Conservatives going to stop pretending that everything is just fine? People are suffering. There is no cause for celebration. \lineBreak Will the government adjust its focus and come up with a real job creation plan?","Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers understand that the global economy is currently facing major challenges. Fortunately, Canada has an economic action plan that has created more than half a million jobs since the end of the depression. That is the success of our economic action plan. We intend to focus on the economy and job creation."
1953,"Mr. Speaker, for the last year and a half, first nation chiefs have been asking to meet with the  \lineBreak Is the government finally prepared to work with first nations and take real action to solve this crisis?","Mr. Speaker, the government works with first nations to deliver real results for their priorities. We have invested heavily in first nation schools, including in Attawapiskat, and in water and waste water infrastructure, health and housing, and we have done this all in full partnership with first nations.  \lineBreak We have a plan. We will continue to invest in practical solutions and real results."
1954,"Mr. Speaker, all of a sudden, the Conservatives are waking up and blaming everyone but themselves. \lineBreak Federal public servants went to Attawapiskat not once, not twice, not three times, but 10 times in the past year. They must have submitted reports on the situation. Has there been any follow-up to these visits or is the department in the habit of leaving reports on shelves to gather dust rather than taking action as required? \lineBreak Is the conclusion here that the government is completely indifferent to the living conditions of aboriginal people?","Mr. Speaker, our first priority is to get residents into warm, dry and safe shelter. Each time we received a request from the community, we took immediate action. Our officials have been working with the community to address substantial renovation for immediate housing needs, and we continue to support implementing their emergency management plan.  \lineBreak At the same time, we will be working with the third party manager to ensure that federal funding directly benefits community members and that the community's long-term needs will be met."

1956,"Mr. Speaker, David Orchard would recognize what is going on here, as do the brave men and women of the Canadian Forces, and they have blown the whistle.  \lineBreak Search and rescue equipment was misused. It took not one trip, but a reconnaissance mission too. It cost $32,000 per hour. The chopper could not land. The minister had to be hoisted aboard in a basket, and all the while quick, inexpensive alternatives were available by land and boat.  \lineBreak Before this guise gets any worse, why will the government not simply accept the honesty of Colonel Ploughman and apologize?","Mr. Speaker, as I said, none of the facts here have changed. The  \lineBreak Without any facts and without any changes, I know the hon. member can make a great deal of noise. I know he knows a lot about the use of government aircraft from his own personal experience. Our practices are very different from those of his government."
1957,"Mr. Speaker, that is not what the emails say. \lineBreak Under the pretext of participating in a search and rescue mission, the  \lineBreak A rescue helicopter is like a fire truck or an ambulance. The Department of National Defence is not a Toys ""R"" Us. The minister does not seem to understand that this is serious. \lineBreak Why does he have such contempt for the Canadian Forces?","Mr. Speaker, the "

1959,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak We now know that he was collected from an isolated fishing lodge in Newfoundland under the pretext of an imaginary rescue operation. We could say that the minister's story is nautical miles from reality. \lineBreak Will he admit his mistake and apologize for using a Canadian Forces search and rescue helicopter for personal reasons?","Mr. Speaker, this is all about piling it on. All of these issues have already been addressed many times by the "
1960,"Mr. Speaker, all reasonable people agree that the F-35 program is a fiasco. Today it was vice admiral David Venlet, the Pentagon's man in charge of the F-35s, who said that the ballooning costs of the program “sucks the wind out of your lungs”. He then said that the F-35s are riddled with flaws. \lineBreak Why is the ","Mr. Speaker, our government is always monitoring our involvement in the joint fighter strike program. In any event, we are doing that very closely. As of now, the F-35 program is on track."
1961,"Mr. Speaker, although the minister is stubbornly defending the F-35 program, a new problem was discovered this week. \lineBreak We learned today that production of the F-35 aircraft will be delayed because cracks were discovered during testing. These new problems will again increase costs significantly. The F-35 program is experiencing one problem after another. \lineBreak When will the minister cancel this costly program that is doomed to failure and opt for an open and transparent bidding process?","Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that the hon. member opposite is reading too many headlines, and many of them are her own. \lineBreak In any event, our program remains on track. We are monitoring the progress very closely, as are our partner nations."
1962,"Mr. Speaker, this government's failure to act in the fight against climate change is being criticized as far away as Africa. \lineBreak A former minister in the Mandela government, Jay Naidoo, said he no longer recognizes Canada and described the Conservative government's actions as a betrayal towards Africa. \lineBreak The unrestricted development of the tar sands will have repercussions on the entire planet. \lineBreak Does this government realize that the green economy is the way of the future and will it do its fair share within the international community?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that on this side of the House we refer to that great Canadian resource as the oil sands. \lineBreak Canada will participate in Durban in the same good faith that we have demonstrated at all of the pre-conference meetings throughout this year. \lineBreak As my colleague should know, Canada is working toward a single new international climate change regime that will include commitments by all major emitters. The Cancun agreements building on Copenhagen provide a solid foundation for exactly that."
1963,"Mr. Speaker, Canada's reputation continues to take a beating thanks to the government's inaction on the environment. Yesterday, the  \lineBreak While we already know that the government does not listen to scientists nor environmentalists, now even China is shaking its head at us. \lineBreak Canada's blocking progress at the Durban conference. If the government is so serious about creating jobs, why has it turned its back on the new green energy economy?","Mr. Speaker, I would remind my hon. colleague that this government is proud of the abundance of natural resources with which Canada has been blessed. We are equally proud of the responsible and sustainable way that we exploit those resources for the benefit of Canada and for the benefit of many developing countries and countries that are vulnerable to climate change and require adaptation. \lineBreak We are also proud of our commitment to the Copenhagen accord and the Cancun agreements, and we are working to meet our 2020 greenhouse gas target reductions."
1964,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday we all stood in the House to recognize World AIDS Day and renew our pledge to beat this disease. \lineBreak World AIDS Day has come and gone, but the work is not done. For the first time ever, the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria had to cancel its annual funding round because donors like Canada are reneging on their commitments. Despite its promise, the government has yet to transfer even one penny to the fund. \lineBreak  When will the government make good on its commitment and support the global fund?","Mr. Speaker, Canada is very proud to be one of the largest contributors to the global fund. Our contributions are on track and we will fulfill our commitments. \lineBreak Our contributions are making a difference. For example, the rate of TB infections is down for the first time in decades, more mothers and children are getting access to malaria drugs, and 3.2 million people are getting treatment for AIDS. \lineBreak When this government makes a commitment, we live up to it."
1965,"Mr. Speaker, what shocked Canadians this week was to see the Conservatives rush through their uncosted, ineffective crime bill. They shut down debate and now they are introducing their own 11th hour amendments to fix flaws in the bill. \lineBreak Provinces, police, municipalities, crime experts and the legal community have all sounded the alarm, and now even the government is admitting that the bill is flawed. \lineBreak Why has the government left it to the unelected Senate to patch up its failed bill?","Mr. Speaker, this is an outstanding piece of legislation, a bill that sends out the right message to those individuals who bring drugs into Canada, to organized crime, to drug traffickers and to people who are in the grow op business for the purpose of trafficking. It also sends out a message to all those individuals who get involved with child pornography or molesting children that this will not be tolerated and that there will be serious consequences. \lineBreak We went to the Canadian people on this and I am again very grateful to Canadians for all the support they have given us on this issue. "
1966,"Mr. Speaker, I do not know why, but I sense that the  \lineBreak I know this government does not care about numbers that do not support its ideology. If it did care, it would realize that 93% of Canadians feel safe in their communities. Still, it is moving forward with its ill-advised bill on law and order, even though the costs are unknown and the legislation is flawed by the government's own admission. \lineBreak Why will the Conservatives not stop scaring people and start working with the opposition, to find a more balanced approach regarding the justice system?","Mr. Speaker, first, our approach is obviously a very balanced one.  \lineBreak Since we are talking about numbers today, and even though we do not govern based on statistics, I want to mention a Léger Marketing poll that was conducted in recent weeks. It shows that over 80% of Quebeckers support a more repressive justice system, with stiffer sentences. Another survey by the same firm shows that one out of every two people living in large urban centres, which means half of all Quebeckers, do not feel safe. "
1967,"Mr. Speaker, with its poor negotiating skills, the Conservative government is going to be holding the short end of the stick in the European Union free trade agreement. Canadians already pay a lot for their medicines and will have to pay almost $3 billion more to have access to them. This will put $3 billion more in the pockets of pharmaceutical companies without us obtaining anything in return. \lineBreak Does this government realize that medicines are not a luxury but a necessity for sick people?","Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the member that contrary to what she has suggested, this government always protects and advances Canada's interests during international negotiations. We will only enter into agreements that benefit Canadians in the long run. I want to also assure the member that we continue to consult broadly with Canadians.  \lineBreak This agreement still has a long way to go to be completed. I would ask that member not to prejudge the process, not to prejudge the outcome, and to work with us to build economic growth and jobs in Canada."
1968,"Mr. Speaker, this government's wait-and-see attitude is deplorable. Canada has the fourth highest drug costs and with these EU free trade negotiations may go to the top of the list. \lineBreak In this period of economic uncertainty do we really want to further burden the sick? \lineBreak Will the ","Mr. Speaker, again, I want to assure the House and the member that this Conservative government does not sign any agreements unless they are in the best interests of Canadians. \lineBreak The benefits of a CIDA agreement are significant. A study indicated that we could expect a 20% increase in bilateral trade between the European Union and Canada, an increase of 80,000 new jobs, a $1,000 increase in the average family's income, and a $12 billion increase in our GDP. \lineBreak It is only this Conservative government that will actually stand up."
1969,"Mr. Speaker, the people of Windsor understand that less trade equals fewer jobs and more trade equals more jobs. \lineBreak While we are working to increase trade and remove barriers at the border, the member for  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for  \lineBreak The member understands that removing barriers at the border will create jobs and economic growth. But it does beg the question of why the NDP member for "
1970,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  \lineBreak Celebrations for the War of 1812 will now cost three times more than planned. One would think it was the President of the Treasury Board drafting the budget. \lineBreak Could the minister explain what happened between mid-October and December 1 to triple the costs?","Mr. Speaker, let me just begin by saying that I will be celebrating my second annual Christmas concert in my riding with local talent. I hope the hon. member might have a chance to come and take a look at some of the spectacular Christmas talent that we have.  \lineBreak With respect to that story, of course the story he is referring to is false. We will be celebrating and commemorating the War of 1812 because it is an extraordinarily important event in Canadian history. The cost is $28 million over four years. I hope that the hon. member and the NDP will join with us in celebrating all the things that we have to be proud of as a country."
1971,"Mr. Speaker, then I guess he needs to speak to his minister. In less than two months costs have already more than tripled.  \lineBreak What is the final price tag going to be for Canadian families? Canadians deserve to know the real costs, not “around $70 million”. That is simply unacceptable.  \lineBreak Why, in a time of economic crisis and with 19,000 more jobs lost, does the government believe that spending $12 million on military re-enactment is appropriate? ","Mr. Speaker, again, we have committed $28 million over four years. We are going to be celebrating Canada and celebrating one of the most important events in Canadian history. It is one of the things that led to this country being as great as it is. It is one of the events that helped make sure that the French factor in Canada is protected. It is one of the things that helped lead us to Confederation.  \lineBreak We will never apologize for celebrating what has made this the best country in the world in which to live. I only hope that the NDP members will, for once, think of why this country is so great, think about why it is that they are sitting in this place, and join with us and the thousands of Canadians who will celebrate this event. "
1972,"Mr. Speaker, under the guise of finding efficiencies, the minister responsible for Service Canada has carved the guts out of her department. Part-time and casual workers are long gone and nearly 90 permanent employees who have left since July have not been replaced. Add to the backlog of calls that are already there 18,600 new unemployed Canadians this month, and we get a sense as to the backlog of work and the demand on Service Canada workers. \lineBreak However, this minister has the gall to blame the workers. It is not the workers at Service Canada, it is the management, or should I say the mismanagement. When is someone on the government bench going to wake up and--",The hon. Minister of Human Resources.
1973,"Mr. Speaker, our goal is to help get benefits to Canadians in need just as quickly as possible. To do that, we are overhauling the system. We are automating where we can, so that people can get more accurate service more quickly. We are doing everything we can to help the good employees at Service Canada fulfill their jobs and help Canadians in their time of need. ","Mr. Speaker, as Dr. Phil would say, “How is that going for you”? \lineBreak The call centre industry that is driven by productivity has a standard of 85% occupancy. Occupancy is when an agent is actually on the phone, engaged with a phone call. \lineBreak  At Service Canada it has been for quite some time at 99%. The people at the other end of the phone, the clients, they are not there trying to upgrade their cable package or order a pizza. They are looking for a cheque. They want to feed their families. They want to pay their bills. \lineBreak However, the mismanagement we have seen at Service Canada is denying them the money that is their money—"
1974,The hon. Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development.,"Mr. Speaker, we are trying to ensure that Canadians do get their cheques faster, do get their deposits faster. That is why we are changing the system. \lineBreak We know it needs fixing. We know that the employees at Service Canada need more help to achieve their goal of helping Canadians.  \lineBreak That is why, in our budget, we included funds to help put in new computer systems that are going to speed up the process. Unfortunately, the hon. member and his party voted against that help."
1975,"Mr. Speaker, allegations of corruption at the Canada Revenue Agency have been making the news for six years now. \lineBreak The  \lineBreak Why is the minister refusing to tell us what the measures are? Does she have something to hide?","Mr. Speaker, the government does take this allegation of misconduct very seriously. We will not tolerate this type of activity. \lineBreak We are co-operating fully with the RCMP investigation. It is important to note that many of these allegations go back more than a decade. The RCMP is working its way through the criminal justice system. Of course, the integrity of our tax system is critical to all of us. \lineBreak I would, please, ask the hon. opposition to let the RCMP do the work. We believe that it can move forward and will get answers in due course."
1976,"Mr. Speaker, Camp Ashraf, in northern Iraq, is a makeshift home to political refugees. Those people are opposed to the nearby regime in Iran. \lineBreak Since the fall of Saddam Hussein, they have been protected by the U.S. and coalition forces. However, with the U.S. winding down its operations in Iraq, who is going to protect these people? Iraq has demanded the camp be closed by the end of the month.  \lineBreak Could the ","Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate the member for his efforts as a member of the human rights subcommittee. \lineBreak Canada encourages the Iraqi government to extend the closure deadline to allow remaining residents sufficient time to take the required steps to seek asylum, and to allow the United Nations Human Rights Council to consider and process applications. \lineBreak We call on Iraq to meet its obligations under international law. We also want to ensure that Camp Ashraf residents are not forcibly transferred to another country where they could suffer. \lineBreak I can assure the House that my officials and I will be monitoring the situation very closely."
1977,"Mr. Speaker, under the guise of being a trade-oriented government, the Conservatives have been ignoring our established markets. First the minister is surprised and disappointed when the United States shuts us out of its market. Now Canada's pork producers have a market worth $300 million at risk in South Korea because of government inaction. Just as with jobs, not losing markets is every bit as important as finding new ones. \lineBreak Why has the minister consistently failed to secure a trade agreement with South Korea? Why?","Mr. Speaker, our government is working hard to open up new doors for Canadian farmers, workers and businesses. We recently negotiated further steps toward opening up market access with South Korea on beef and are closely monitoring its domestic implementation process.  \lineBreak We will only sign trade agreements that are actually in the best interests of Canadians, unlike the Liberals. In less than six years, we have concluded free trade agreements with nine countries. We continue to work on agreements with 50 more."
1978,"Mr. Speaker, there are many problems with traffic congestion in the greater Montreal area. People are using public transit more, especially in Laval. The regions's public transit commissions are already seeing large increases in their ridership. This trend will continue in the coming years. A national public transit strategy would result in better coordination of services. \lineBreak Will this government work with us on a national strategy?","Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank the hon. member for asking this question because the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport is studying this matter. \lineBreak First, we must recognize that public transit is under provincial and municipal jurisdiction. The federal government's role is to support these two levels of government. That is why we have already made record investments to support public transit and other means of transportation in rural communities. "
1979,"Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many constituents in my riding and across Canada worried about troubling U.S. tax laws that would punish Canadians. For many of these constituents, their only transgression was failing to file IRS paperwork they were unaware they were required to file. As such, our government called on the U.S. government to look upon these individuals with leniency. We were also clear that penalties imposed by the IRS under FBAR will not be collected by the Canada Revenue Agency on their behalf. \lineBreak Can the parliamentary secretary please update the House on this situation?","Mr. Speaker, of course our Conservative government understands that this has been a source of considerable anxiety. We have raised this issue repeatedly with the government of the United States. The  \lineBreak We are happy to report that the U.S. has agreed to show leniency. It will waive penalties for many and allow potential refunds of penalties already paid. More details will follow in the coming weeks. This is a victory for Canadians and a testament to our positive working relationship with our American neighbours."
1980,"Mr. Speaker, the weak economy continues to have a significant impact: 31,000 jobs were lost in Quebec in November, leaving families penniless just a few weeks before Christmas. \lineBreak When it should be helping unemployed workers and struggling businesses, the government prefers to wrap itself in symbols of Canadian identity and waste $70 million—$40 million more than planned—celebrating a war that was fought two centuries ago. \lineBreak What is the government's priority: to help thousands of unemployed workers in Quebec or to spend millions of dollars celebrating a war?","Mr. Speaker, Canada's economy has now created nearly 600,000 net new jobs since July 2009. However, we do sympathize with Canadians who have recently lost their jobs. \lineBreak  As we have said all along, we are not immune to the global economic turbulence being felt by our largest trading partners, the United States and Europe. As witnessed by recent events in Greece, the global economic recovery remains fragile.  \lineBreak Canada will be impacted by these events from outside our borders. That is why we are working to implement the next phase of Canada's economic action plan with measures to create and protect jobs, such as a hiring credit for small business."
1981,"Mr. Speaker, in the “guise” or “stupidity of the day” category, Service Canada decided that in Quebec, to avoid any criticism, it would remove all Christmas decorations. Imagine the Guy-Favreau Complex without Christmas decorations. It is time to turn the judgment switch back on.  \lineBreak Since the ","Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that there is no national directive on Christmas decorations. \lineBreak In fact, what we do have at the HRSD head office is massive trees and well decorated wreaths. They brighten up the place and brighten up our spirits. As far as the "
1982,"Mr. Speaker, Canada ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities two years ago, but there is still no independent mechanism in place to ensure that it is complied with, even though that was a requirement under the convention. This Saturday is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. Unfortunately, it will be another opportunity to underscore this government's inaction and empty promises. \lineBreak Why this refusal to establish independent oversight of the implementation of the UN convention?","Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish everyone a happy International Day of Persons with Disabilities. It is very important that we help persons with disabilities, and we have launched a number of programs to that end. \lineBreak For example, the registered disability savings plan has far exceeded our expectations in terms of take up. It will help families with someone who is dependent upon them plan for the future. \lineBreak We have also provided additional funding for the disabled, so that they can attend post-secondary education, and made it easier for them to get financed. We are doing a lot to help the disabled and we will continue to do so."
1983,"Mr. Speaker, there is every indication that Canada is prepared to abandon its international commitments and withdraw from Kyoto. That is a real shame. If the Conservatives are not interested in fighting climate change with the rest of the world, why are they going to Durban? Is it because they just told their representatives to sabotage the talks?","Mr. Speaker, as we have been saying from the beginning, the Kyoto protocol is an agreement that is not in the best interests of the climate or of Canada. It will hurt Canada's economy. What Canadians expect from Canada and our government is an approach that balances the interests of our environment with those of our economy. The Kyoto protocol is an agreement that does not work for Canada, for the environment or for our economy. That is the direction we will continue to take."
1984,"Mr. Speaker, 191 countries have signed and ratified the Kyoto protocol. Canada is the only country that is abandoning its commitments and going back on its word, the only country that is going to pull out of Kyoto. We should be ashamed of this situation and the government's position. The Conservatives will turn Canada into an international pariah. What kind of leadership is that? Is Canada part of the Kyoto protocol, yes or no?","As I said, Mr. Speaker, the Kyoto protocol simply does not work. It only contains 27% of the world's emitters of greenhouse gases. What Canadians have asked for and what our government has led on is a true global effort to fight what is a true global problem. That is why the  \lineBreak What the NDP is asking this government to do is to follow through and increase taxes on consumers with a carbon tax, as was discussed last night with the nine brightest lights of the NDP running for leadership, and is asking us to punish Canadian consumers to go forward with an accord that simply does not work and that will not have the intended results that people want. We have the right way."
1985,"Mr. Speaker, by opting out of Kyoto, Canada does not show any leadership. \lineBreak Canada will have no say in any future agreement. We will not be at the table. The Conservatives want to play alone in their oil sand box. That is not the way to show leadership. Canada committed to the Kyoto protocol, so respect Canada's word, respect Canada's commitment. Why destroy Canada's reputation?","Mr. Speaker, what hurts Canada's reputation is what the previous Liberal government did, which is what we will not do. What we will do is pursue a true global approach that works and that is why we have gone forward with the Copenhagen accord. \lineBreak What the Liberals did, which seems like the NDP is applauding, was sign the Kyoto accord, have no plan, say they that were in favour of it, did nothing, and at the last minute, when Michael Ignatieff said they that did not get the job done, they tried to prove that they were getting the job done by imposing a massive tax on Canadians in the form of a carbon tax. Fail, fail and fail again, and that is why they are over there and that is why we are showing leadership in a new direction."
1986,"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives are pulling us out of the Kyoto protocol, claiming that the big polluters must participate. But China has shown that it is open. The government has no excuse. Withdrawing from the Kyoto protocol is a reckless decision. The health of Canadians is at stake here, and Canadian jobs are on the line. Will this government realize that we must develop an economy that is based on sustainable energy?","Mr. Speaker, imagine a place where 75% of our electricity is generated by sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, or where a government invests billions of dollars in clean energy technology, or where there is one of the most stringent regulatory frameworks in the world. Wait a second; that is Canada. \lineBreak When will the opposition get on board?"
1987,"Mr. Speaker, by withdrawing from Kyoto the minister is withdrawing Canada from the energy economy of the future. It sends a clear message to the employers of the future not to invest here. What timing, because China is now open to strict standards but the Conservatives instead are focused on environmental sabotage. \lineBreak Canadians want to see investments in the world--",Order. The member for Halifax has the floor and she should be allowed to put the question. The hon. member for Halifax.
1988," Canadians want to see investments in the world that we will leave our children, Mr. Speaker. They want Canada to be a leader in building a sustainable economy.  \lineBreak Why does the government only listen to big polluters? When will it start listening to Canadians?","Mr. Speaker, as opposed to the opposition that would have us continue with an international accord that only contains less than one-third of global emissions, we are taking strong action here at home. \lineBreak With regard to a clean energy economy, I would ask my colleague opposite what she would call an economy that has billions of dollars of research into clean technology, that exports across the globe intellectual property dealing with clean energy technology?  \lineBreak We are a leader internationally. The opposition should recognize that."

1990,"Mr. Speaker, temperatures have again dropped below -20 in Attawapiskat, and the people are suffering through another lost week of inaction. \lineBreak The Red Cross teams are on the ground, but the federal government is still nowhere to be seen in this community. Other than deposing the band leadership, Attawapiskat has been left to fend for itself in this humanitarian crisis. \lineBreak Now that the minister is taking control of this community, what plan does he have to ensure that the people living in the tents, cabins and trailer are going to be moved into safe, reasonable, permanent housing?","Mr. Speaker, our government is responding to the situation. The third party manager is in the community and is working to address the urgent health and safety needs of residents. \lineBreak We are continuing to work with Emergency Management Ontario and the first nation. Supplies are being sent into the community, and materials for renovating homes have been ordered by the chief and council. \lineBreak I strongly urge the chief and council to work with the third party manager in the interests of the people."
1991,"Mr. Speaker, unfortunately a lot of that was bunk. \lineBreak The community is on its own. It has moved in a third party manager, and the community is defending itself with no help from the federal government. Even Chuck Strahl said that this was a train wreck coming for years. \lineBreak There is a lot of blame that can go around, but only the minister can fix this situation. He has to tell us why he thinks that putting people in an unheated hockey arena is a solution. Where is his plan to guarantee that these people will be moved into safe, proper housing with a long-term plan? Where is that plan?","Mr. Speaker, the chief and council are using the resources that we provided to order materials for housing. The third party manager and emergency management professionals are in the community. \lineBreak I encourage the chief and council to work with the third party manager on behalf of the people of Attawapiskat."
1992,"Mr. Speaker, the latest OECD report is damning. The gap between the rich and the poor is growing bigger more quickly here than in other developed countries. The poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer. Average families are having more and more difficulty making ends meet. The OECD has clearly stated that Canadians need good jobs. They also need a tax system that is progressive and fair. However, all this government does is give gifts to companies with money to burn. \lineBreak When will the government finally come up with a job creation plan? When will this country return to a fair tax system?","Mr. Speaker, the member opposite refers to the OECD report. He does not mention that the OECD stated that employment is the most promising way of tackling inequality, and that the biggest challenge is to create more jobs. \lineBreak This government is focused precisely on the goal of economic growth and the creation of jobs in Canada. There are nearly 600,000 net new jobs, the best job creation record in the G7. The OECD and the IMF say that Canada's economic growth and job creation will be the best going forward. \lineBreak That is how we address inequity. That is what the OECD—"
1993,The hon. member for Burnaby—New Westminster.,"Mr. Speaker, sadly the results are in on the Conservatives' so-called plan. They lost 19,000 jobs in the month of November. They lost 72,000 full-time jobs in the month of October. Because of their policies, the gap between rich and other Canadians is growing. \lineBreak The OECD says that it is getting worse and worse. That is not surprising because at every turn the Conservatives put the well connected first. Bank profits are at a record high, and so are food bank lineups in this country. \lineBreak Why do the Conservatives not care about middle-class and poor Canadian families and the income gap? When will the Conservatives start putting everyday families first? When will they stop the hemorrhaging of good jobs in this country?"
1994,"Mr. Speaker, the member opposite covered a lot of ground there. He is mad at the banks. He is mad at profits. He thinks we do not reduce taxes. Where do we start? \lineBreak Well, we have reduced taxes on average by $3,000 for every Canadian family since we took office. How did the NDP members help with that? They voted against every tax reduction. They say they care about Canadians, but they are happy to keep taxing. I heard it in the debate yesterday. The only question was, how much more should we tax Canadians? That is what we hear from the NDP. \lineBreak Do they care that we have bank profits? I care. It gives us a sound banking system, and they paid $8.3 billion—",The hon. member for Windsor West.
1995,"Mr. Speaker, today we learned the government's secret border deal with the Americans will cost Canadians a whopping $1 billion, and we still do not even know what the Conservatives are quietly negotiating away. We do not even know if Canadians' privacy will be protected in the secret deal. Every time we ask the government for assurances, we get nothing but silence. Canadians deserve answers, not secrecy, not stonewalling. \lineBreak When will the government come clean with what it is giving over to the Americans on this secret border deal? Canadians deserve to know this now.","Mr. Speaker, we are working with President Obama and his administration to deliver on the shared vision for perimeter security and economic competitiveness. \lineBreak We are strengthening our collaboration to streamline and secure our border and enhance the legendary co-operation to ensure that people and goods can flow freely and safely between our two countries. What is wrong with that picture?"
1996,"Mr. Speaker, once again, we get a response from a government that is controlling critical information and keeping it from Canadians. This week, Canada and the United States are going to sign a border security agreement. We know that it is going to cost Canadian families at least $1 billion, but that is all we know because the government did not want to table the agreement in Parliament before signing it. Citizens' groups and the Information Commissioner are concerned about the possible infringement of privacy rights. \lineBreak Will the government finally reassure Canadians and tell them what this agreement says?","Mr. Speaker, the privacy of Canadians is very important to us. The United States will not end up with more information than is already accessible. Exit controls are reasonable. This plan is about jobs and the economy."
1997,"Mr. Speaker, the  \lineBreak Even the  \lineBreak Will the minister bring this to an end today by doing the honourable thing and apologizing?","Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times, I was called back to work from personal time. Any suggestion that there was a re-tasking or a diversion of search and rescue aircraft from its actual tasking is simply untrue."
1998,"Mr. Speaker, the minister continues to mislead the House. He keeps pretending that there was a planned exercise. We all know there was no planned exercise. If the minister has documentation to the contrary, he should table it this afternoon.
